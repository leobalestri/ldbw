BITH contends it sufficiently pleaded causes of action against Mikail for \\nconversion, unjust enrichment and constructive \\ntrust.  We disagree and therefore affirm \\nthe judgment.\\n \\nFACTS\\n1\\n \\n \\nThis appeal arises from a complicated web of alleged fraud.\\n2\\n  \\nOn or about June 6, \\n\\nHenrik Sardariani (Sardariani) wa\\ns looking for a short\\n-\\nterm loan of $2.5 million.  BITH \\nwas told that Sardariani was purchasing a medical hospital in Los Angeles County for \\n$30 million and needed a $2.5 million loan to qualify for an extension of the hospital \\nescrow or risk forfeiting a $\\n3 million deposit he had made on the hospital transaction.  In \\ntruth, the hospital purchase by Sardariani was fraudulent, and real property Sardariani \\nproposed to use to secure the $2.5 million loan did not exist.\\n \\n \\nBITH was told the $2.5 million loan would\\n \\nbe placed in a secure escrow account \\nfor 30 days and, in exchange for the loan, Sardariani would pay BITH a $500,000 loan \\nfee/broker commission for the short\\n-\\nterm loan.\\n \\n \\n\\nprovided \\nBITH with a copy of an executed hospital purchase contract purportedly \\nevidencing the sale of the hospital to Sardariani.  The documents indicated that defendant \\n                                        \\n     \\n \\n1\\n \\n \\nBecause this case comes to us after entry of a judgment based on the sustaining of \\na demurrer, we accept as true the material alle\\n\\nShoemaker \\nv. Myers\\n \\n(1990) 52 Cal.3d 1, 7; \\nCarter v. Prime Healthcare Paradise Valley LLC\\n \\n(2011) \\n198 Cal.App.4th 396, 401.)  However, we do not assume the truth of contentions, \\ndeductions or conclusions of fact or law.  (\\nBlank\\n \\nv. Kirwan\\n \\n(1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.)\\n \\n2\\n \\n \\nWe previously reversed a judgment of dismissal in favor of a different defendant, \\nDowney Savings and Loan Association (Downey Savings), after the trial court sustained \\n\\ncomplaint without leave to amend.  \\n(\\nBITH, LLC v. Downey Savings and Loan Assn. \\n(Sept. 29, 2010, B210007 [nonpub. \\nopn.].)\\n \\n \\n3\\n \\nAxcess Escrow was the escrow company being used for the hospital purchase.  Young \\nprovided BIT\\nH with a false accounting prepared by Downey Savings that purported to \\nshow Sardariani had more than $3 million in an escrow account maintained by Axcess \\nEscrow at Downey Savings.  In reality, Sardariani had put down no deposit for the \\npurchase of the hosp\\nital, and the hospital purchase contract and accounting were \\n\\n\\nin fact, no such fund\\ns existed.  Young also provided BITH with a fraudulent financial \\nstatement for Sardariani showing he had a net worth of about $20 million.\\n \\n \\nOn or about June\\n \\n11, 2007, BITH entered into an escrow funding agreement with \\nSardariani.  Under the agreement, BITH\\n \\nagreed to lend $2.5 million to Sardariani subject \\nto conditions including that the loan escrow would be in the exclusive control of BITH, \\nthe escrow agent would be selected by BITH and the money and loan fees would be \\nreturned or paid to BITH within appro\\nximately three weeks.  However, the escrow \\nfunding agreement was modified before it was signed to insert Axcess Escrow as the \\napplicable escrow company because it was supposedly already handling the hospital sale.  \\nBITH deposited $2.5 million by wire trans\\nfer into Downey Savings for deposit to the \\naccount of Axcess Escrow.\\n \\n \\nAxcess Escrow maintained no account at Downey Savings, and Downey Savings \\n\\nSavings accepted the $2.5 million\\n \\nwire transfer and deposited the amount in the account \\n\\n \\n \\nUnder the escrow funding agreement, Sardariani was required to deposit his \\n\\nnt by June 13, 2007.  Although BITH \\n\\nDowney Savings, BITH never received any documentation confirming the deposit.  In \\ntruth, Sardariani never actually made the deposit.  On\\n \\nJune 12, 2007, Downey Savings \\nwas instructed to wire $1.9 million of the deposited money to a bank account in Hong \\nKong controlled by Sardariani and another defendant, Chris Woods.  Woods and another \\n \\n4\\n \\ndefendant allegedly directed the wire transfer of the r\\nemaining $600,000 to domestic \\nbank accounts controlled by Mikail and other defendants.\\n \\n \\nSubsequently, Sardariani informed BITH that he had used $600,000 of the money \\nhe obtained from BITH to pay back preexisting debts owing from Sardariani to Mikail \\nand ot\\nher defendants and he had told them the funds were coming from an escrow \\naccount at Downey Savings funded by BITH that were supposed to be used for the \\nhospital purchase transaction.\\n \\n \\n\\nom BITH \\n\\n \\nPROCEDURAL HISTORY\\n \\n \\nBITH filed the present action on October 23, 2007, against Sardariani and \\ndefendants other than Mikail.  The trial court sustained a demurr\\ner to the complaint, with \\n\\ndefendant on May 20, 2008.  Before Mikail could respond to the first amended \\ncomplaint, BITH filed a second amended complaint including Mikail \\nas a named \\ndefendant.\\n \\n \\nThe second amended complaint purported to allege against the various defendants \\nsome 17 causes of action.  As against Mikail, BITH asserted claims for fraud, conspiracy, \\nconversion, violation of Penal Code section 496 (receipt of sto\\nlen property), constructive \\ntrust, common counts and unjust enrichment.\\n \\n \\nMikail generally and specially demurred to all seven of the causes of action \\n\\ndemurrer and gra\\nnted leave to amend, indicating that BITH was entitled to an opportunity \\n\\n \\n.\\n \\n.\\n \\n\\n\\n3\\n \\n                                        \\n     \\n \\n3\\n \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n.\\n \\n.\\n \\n.\\n  \\n[¶]  .\\n \\n.\\n \\n.\\n \\nThrowing \\n \\n5\\n \\n \\nBIT\\nH filed a third amended complaint.  As against Mikail, BITH asserted claims \\nfor conversion, receipt of stolen property in violation of Penal Code section 496, \\nconstructive trust premised on conversion, and unjust enrichment.  BITH alleged that \\nMikail and o\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ny after a demand was made for its return.\\n \\n \\nMikail generally and specially demurred to the third amended complaint.  The trial \\n\\nunjust enrichment without leave to amend.\\n \\n \\nAs to conversion, the court noted the third amended complaint simply alleged that \\n\\namong others.  BITH alleged the other named defendants did so in order to pay a \\npreexist\\ning debt that they owed to Mikail.  The only wrongful conduct alleged to have \\n\\nconspiracy by \\nagreeing to accept\\n \\n\\n \\nconstructive trust and unjust enrichment were based on the conversion claim, the court \\ndetermined those causes of action also failed.\\n \\n \\nHowever, as to the claim of receiving stolen property in violation of Penal Code \\nsection 496, the court determined that \\n\\nvia a wire transfer from some of the other named defendants and agreed to accept the \\nstolen funds knowing they were stolen were sufficient to state a cause of action.  The \\ncourt accordingly overruled Mikail\\n\\n \\n                                        \\n                                        \\n                                        \\n                         \\n \\n\\nknow who this guy is.  What did he do?  What a\\n\\n \\n \\n6\\n \\n \\nBITH voluntarily dismissed with prejudice the claim for receipt of stolen property \\nunder Penal Code section 496 on August\\n \\n27, 2009.\\n4\\n  \\nOn October\\n \\n19, 2010, the trial court \\nentered a first amended judgment in favor of Mi\\nkail and against BITH.  This timely \\nappeal ensued.\\n \\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\\n \\n \\nOn appeal from a judgment of dismissal following the sustaining of a demurrer \\nwithout leave to amend, the standard of review is de novo, i.e., the reviewing court must \\nexercise its inde\\npendent judgment on whether the complaint states a cause of action.  \\n(\\nAguilera v. Heiman \\n(2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 590, 595; \\nLos Altos El Granada Investors v. \\nCity of Capitola\\n \\n(2006) 139 Cal.App.4th 629, 650.)  In reviewing the complaint, the court \\nassumes th\\ne truth of all well pleaded facts as well as those subject to judicial notice.  \\n(\\nAguilera\\n, at p.\\n \\n593, fn.\\n \\n1.)  If the complaint states a cause of action under any theory, the \\ncomplaint is good against a general demurrer.  (\\nQuelimane Co. v. Stewart Title Gu\\naranty \\nCo.\\n \\n(1998) 19 Cal.4th 26, 38.)\\n \\n \\nOrdinarily, it is an abuse of discretion to sustain a general demurrer to a complaint \\nwithout leave to amend if there is a reasonable possibility the defect in the complaint can \\nbe cured by amendment.  (\\nHendy v. Losse\\n \\n(1991) 54 Cal.3d 723, 742.)  The burden is \\nupon the plaintiff to demonstrate the manner in which the complaint might be amended \\nand how that amendment would change the legal effect of the pleading.  (\\nGoodman v. \\nKennedy \\n(1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349 (\\nGoodman\\n);\\n \\nCarter v. Prime Healthcare Paradise \\nValley LLC,\\n \\nsupra\\n, 198 Cal.App.4th 396, 411.)\\n \\nDISCUSSION\\n \\n1.

(\\nId. \\nat p.\\n \\n451.)\\n \\n \\nUpon analysis, we conclude the trial court correctly ruled that BITH failed to state \\na cause of action for conversion against Mikail.\\n \\nA.

Unless there is a \\nspecific, identifiable sum involved, such as when an agent accepts a sum of money to be \\npaid to another and fails to make the payment, money cannot be the subject of a cause\\n \\nof \\naction for conversion.

And, our attention has been drawn to nothing in the \\nthird amended complaint or incorporated exhibits to support a finding that Mikail \\nengaged in wrongful conduct supporting a claim for conversion.  On appeal, BITH relies \\non \\nOakdale Vill\\nage Group v. Fong \\n(1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 539 (\\nOakdale\\n) in arguing that \\n\\n\\nfraudulent sch\\neme.  We find \\nOakdale \\nunpersuasive as applied to the present facts.\\n \\n \\nIn \\nOakdale\\n, Wang, a partner in a venture, sold a note belonging to the partnership \\nwithout authorization.

The partnership sued Fong for conversion, and Fong asserted he was an \\ninnocent purchaser for value and had no actual knowledge that Wang was without \\nauthority to sell the partne\\n\\nId.\\n \\nat pp. 548\\n-\\n549.)  The appellate court held \\nthat Fong could not rely on this defense because Fong was not a purchaser for value.  The \\n\\ndebt was owe\\nd by Wang personally, not the partnership.  Moreover, Fong had \\nconstructive knowledge of the rights of the other partners as the same partnership \\nagreement Fong reviewed to determine whether Wang had authority to dispose of the \\n\\n \\nother partners.\\n9\\n  \\n(\\nId.\\n \\nat pp. 547\\n-\\n549.)  Here, Mikail is not \\nrelying on the defense that he was an innocent purchaser for value. \\n \\n                                        \\n                                        \\n                                        \\n                         \\n \\nand then conceals or withholds it \\n\\nHowever, as noted previously, BITH later voluntarily dismissed that claim in August \\n2009 eliminating the sole remaining cause of action against Mikail.\\n \\n9\\n \\n \\nEven the appellate court in \\nOakdale\\n \\n\\ndo not find Fong automatically \\nliable for conversion stemming from his \\nreceipt \\n\\nOakdale, supra\\n, \\n43 Cal.App.4th at p.\\n \\n546, italics added.)\\n \\n \\n12\\n \\n \\n\\nbeen stolen from BITH is a naked conclusion \\nor contention, not a factual allegation.

To \\n\\ngoods and to exercise ownership over them, or to prevent the owner from taking \\n\\nhus, a necessary element of the tort is an intent \\nto exercise ownership over property which belongs to another.  For this reason, \\n\\nIbid\\n.)  The third amended \\ncomplaint does not show that Mikail to\\nok any affirmative act with respect to the funds \\ndeposited into his account.  It fails to show any intentional, wrongful act of dominion \\n\\n \\n \\nThe trial court therefore properly dismissed the conversion cause of action.\\n \\n2.  Constructive Trust\\n \\n \\n\\nconstructive trust solely because the claim was premised upon its claim for conversion.  \\nBITH argues that because the conversion claim was properly p\\nleaded the trial court erred \\nin sustaining the demurrer with respect to constructive trust.  BITH further asserts that the \\nclaim for constructive trust was sufficient in that BITH alleged (1) facts constituting the \\nunderlying cause of action and (2) specif\\n\\n\\n \\n \\nA constructive trust is not a true trust but rather an equitable remedy for a plaintiff \\nwho seeks recovery of specific property premised on fraud, breach of fiduciary duty or \\nother act\\n \\nentitling the plaintiff to some relief.  (See 5 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (5th ed. \\n2008) Pleading, § 840, p. 255; \\nBainbridge v. Stoner\\n \\n(1940) 16 Cal.2d 423, 428\\n-\\n429.)  A \\nconstructive trust may be imposed when there is a wrongful acquisition or detention by \\nt\\nhe defendant of property to which the plaintiff is entitled.  (\\nZerin, supra\\n, 53 Cal.App.4th \\nat p.\\n \\n457; \\nWeiss v. Marcus \\n(1975) 51 Cal.App.3d 590, 600.)  A plaintiff must plead some \\n \\n13\\n \\nunderlying cause of action, such as fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, breach \\nof promise to \\nbuy property for the plaintiff or other basis for recovery that entitles the plaintiff to relief.  \\n(See Witkin, \\nsupra\\n, at p.\\n \\n255; \\nMichaelian v. State Comp. Ins. Fund\\n \\n(1996) 50 \\nCal.App.4th 1093, 1114.)\\n \\n \\nHere, BITH expressly based its cause of \\naction for constructive trust, as applied to \\nMikail, on its cause of action for conversion.  The third amended complaint states that \\n\\n \\n.\\n \\n.\\n \\n. Mikail\\n \\n.\\n \\n.\\n \\n. based on the allegations \\n\\nuse of Action for Conversion\\n \\n.\\n \\n.\\n \\n.\\n \\n\\nconversion was the only basis on which BITH premised its constructive trust cause of \\naction against Mikail.\\n \\n \\nThe trial court properly determined that BITH failed to state any claim for \\nconversion against\\n \\nMikail, and therefore Mikail had no obligation to hold the purportedly \\nconverted funds in trust for BITH.  (\\nZerin, supra\\n, 53 Cal.App.4th at p.\\n \\n457.)\\n \\n3.  \\nUnjust Enrichment\\n \\n \\nAs with a claim for constructive trust, \\nthere is no cause of action in California f\\nor \\n\\na failure to make restitution under circumstances where it is equitable to do so.  (\\nMelchior \\nv. New Line Productions, Inc.\\n \\n(2003) 106 Cal.App.4th 779, 793.)  It \\nis synonymous with \\nrestitution.  (\\nIbid.\\n\\nrestitution if he or she is unjustly enriched at the expense of another.  [Citations.]  A \\nperson is enriched if the person receives a benefit at a\\n\\n(\\nMcBride v. Boughton\\n \\n(2004) 123 Cal.App.4th 379, 389, quoting \\nFirst Nationwide \\nSavings v. Perry\\n \\n\\nwhere the defendant obtained a benefit from the plaintiff by\\n \\nfraud, duress, conversion, or \\nsimilar conduct.  In such cases, the plaintiff may choose not to sue in tort, but instead to \\nseek restitution on a quasi\\n-\\ncontract theory (an election referred to at common law as \\n\\n\\nMcBride, supra\\n, at p.\\n \\n388.)  \\nOnly if the circumstances are such as to make it unjust for the benefited person to retain \\nthe benefit is restitution required.  (\\nId.\\n \\nat p.\\n \\n389.)\\n \\n \\n14\\n \\n \\n\\nnt had the same \\nfactual basis as its cause of action for conversion, and the trial court apparently found \\ndismissal of the conversion claim made dismissal of the unjust enrichment claim \\nappropriate as the circumstances were not such as to compel restitutio\\nn.\\n \\n \\nEven if the cause of action for receipt of stolen property under Penal Code section \\n496 might have supported an unjust enrichment claim, BITH could not have been \\n\\nsubs\\nequently voluntarily dismissed the section 496 claim with prejudice.\\n \\n4.  Leave to Amend\\n \\n \\nBITH asserts that the trial court abused its discretion by failing to provide it with a \\nchance to amend its claims against Mikail.  BITH argues that the trial court sh\\nould have \\n\\n\\n\\nlthough BITH \\nasserts the third amended complaint was only its second attempt to state claims against \\n\\ndefendants to recoup its loss.\\n10\\n  \\nBITH listed Mikail as a named defendant \\nin the second \\namended complaint, adding his name to its claims of fraud, conspiracy, violation of Penal \\nCode section 496, unjust enrichment, conversion, common counts and constructive trust.\\n \\n \\n\\n \\nthe trial court \\n\\n\\n\\n-\\npage c\\nomplaint was the allegation \\nthat money was transferred from a general bank account into the accounts of three \\npeople, one of whom was Mikail.  That single allegation formed the basis for all of \\n                                        \\n     \\n \\n10\\n \\n \\nActually, because BITH originally named Mikail as a Doe defendant in the first \\namended compla\\nint, BITH has had three opportunities to state a cause of action against \\nMikail.\\n \\n \\n15\\n \\n\\npportunity to file a third \\n\\n\\n \\n.\\n \\n.\\n \\n.

Was \\n\\nbe kept in the case BITH needed to alleged facts that clearly spelled out his role in the \\ncase, beyond simply owning a bank acco\\nunt into which some money was deposited.\\n \\n \\nIn the third amended complaint, among other things, BITH abandoned its claims \\nagainst Mikail for fraud and conspiracy and dropped his name from the list of defendants \\nwho allegedly had a role in defrauding it.  All\\n \\nBITH offered in the pleading, however, \\n\\naccount was stolen.  BITH failed to request a further opportunity to amend and failed to \\nindicate in what manner the pleading cou\\nld be amended if leave were granted.  Based on \\nthe totality of circumstances, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying BITH \\nleave to amend.\\n \\n \\nOn appeal, BITH asserts that the deficiencies of its pleading can readily be cured \\n\\nendment.  BITH correctly argues that, even when no request to amend \\nwas made in the trial court, it is an abuse of discretion not to grant leave to amend if there \\nis any reasonable opportunity the defect can be cured by amendment.  (\\nGoodman, supra\\n, \\n18 Cal.\\n3d at p.\\n \\n349.)\\n \\n \\nBITH claims in its opening brief that it could amend the pleading simply by \\n\\n\\n \\nSardariani to \\n\\nwanting, not facts.\\n \\n \\nIn its reply brief, BITH asserts the deficiencies could be resolved by an \\n\\nnst Mikail.  Such assurances \\n\\n \\n16\\n \\n\\n(\\nGoodman, supra\\n, 18 Cal.3d at p.\\n \\n349.)\\n \\nDISPOSITION\\n \\n \\nThe \\njudgment is affirmed.

(bith, llc v. downey savings and loan assn. (sept. 29, 2010, b210007 [nonpub. opn.].)  3 axcess escrow was the escrow company being used for the hospital purchase.  young provided bith with a false accounting prepared by downey savings that purported to show sardariani had more than $3 million in an escrow account maintained by axcess escrow at downey savings.  in reality, sardariani had put down no deposit for the purchase of the hospital, and the hospital purchase contract and accounting were in fact, no such funds existed.  young also provided bith with a fraudulent financial statement for sardariani showing he had a net worth of about $20 million.  on or about june 11, 2007, bith entered into an escrow funding agreement with sardariani.  under the agreement, bith agreed to lend $2.5 million to sardariani subject to conditions including that the loan escrow would be in the exclusive control of bith, the escrow agent would be selected by bith and the money and loan fees would be returned or paid to bith within approximately three weeks.  however, the escrow funding agreement was modified before it was signed to insert axcess escrow as the applicable escrow company because it was supposedly already handling the hospital sale.  bith deposited $2.5 million by wire transfer into downey savings for deposit to the account of axcess escrow.  axcess escrow maintained no account at downey savings, and downey savings savings accepted the $2.5 million wire transfer and deposited the amount in the account   under the escrow funding agreement, sardariani was required to deposit his nt by june 13, 2007.  although bith downey savings, bith never received any documentation confirming the deposit.  in truth, sardariani never actually made the deposit.  on june 12, 2007, downey savings was instructed to wire $1.9 million of the deposited money to a bank account in hong kong controlled by sardariani and another defendant, chris woods.  woods and another  4 defendant allegedly directed the wire transfer of the remaining $600,000 to domestic bank accounts controlled by mikail and other defendants.  subsequently, sardariani informed bith that he had used $600,000 of the money he obtained from bith to pay back preexisting debts owing from sardariani to mikail and other defendants and he had told them the funds were coming from an escrow account at downey savings funded by bith that were supposed to be used for the hospital purchase transaction.  om bith  procedural history  bith filed the present action on october 23, 2007, against sardariani and defendants other than mikail.  the trial court sustained a demurrer to the complaint, with defendant on may 20, 2008.  before mikail could respond to the first amended complaint, bith filed a second amended complaint including mikail as a named defendant.  the second amended complaint purported to allege against the various defendants some 17 causes of action.  as against mikail, bith asserted claims for fraud, conspiracy, conversion, violation of penal code section 496 (receipt of stolen property), constructive trust, common counts and unjust enrichment.  mikail generally and specially demurred to all seven of the causes of action demurrer and granted leave to amend, indicating that bith was entitled to an opportunity  . . 3                                               3    . . .  [¶]  . . . throwing  5  bith filed a third amended complaint.  as against mikail, bith asserted claims for conversion, receipt of stolen property in violation of penal code section 496, constructive trust premised on conversion, and unjust enrichment.  bith alleged that mikail and oy after a demand was made for its return.  mikail generally and specially demurred to the third amended complaint.  the trial unjust enrichment without leave to amend.  as to conversion, the court noted the third amended complaint simply alleged that among others.  bith alleged the other named defendants did so in order to pay a preexisting debt that they owed to mikail.  the only wrongful conduct alleged to have conspiracy by agreeing to accept  constructive trust and unjust enrichment were based on the conversion claim, the court determined those causes of action also failed.  however, as to the claim of receiving stolen property in violation of penal code section 496, the court determined that via a wire transfer from some of the other named defendants and agreed to accept the stolen funds knowing they were stolen were sufficient to state a cause of action.  the court accordingly overruled mikail                                                                                                                                                   know who this guy is.  what did he do?  what a  6  bith voluntarily dismissed with prejudice the claim for receipt of stolen property under penal code section 496 on august 27, 2009.4  on october 19, 2010, the trial court entered a first amended judgment in favor of mikail and against bith.  this timely appeal ensued. standard of review  on appeal from a judgment of dismissal following the sustaining of a demurrer without leave to amend, the standard of review is de novo, i.e., the reviewing court must exercise its independent judgment on whether the complaint states a cause of action.  (aguilera v. heiman (2009) 174 cal.app.4th 590, 595; los altos el granada investors v. city of capitola (2006) 139 cal.app.4th 629, 650.)  in reviewing the complaint, the court assumes the truth of all well pleaded facts as well as those subject to judicial notice.  (aguilera, at p. 593, fn. 1.)  if the complaint states a cause of action under any theory, the complaint is good against a general demurrer.  (quelimane co. v. stewart title guaranty co. (1998) 19 cal.4th 26, 38.)  ordinarily, it is an abuse of discretion to sustain a general demurrer to a complaint without leave to amend if there is a reasonable possibility the defect in the complaint can be cured by amendment.  (hendy v. losse (1991) 54 cal.3d 723, 742.)  the burden is upon the plaintiff to demonstrate the manner in which the complaint might be amended and how that amendment would change the legal effect of the pleading.  (goodman v. kennedy (1976) 18 cal.3d 335, 349 (goodman); carter v. prime healthcare paradise valley llc, supra, 198 cal.app.4th 396, 411.) discussion 1.  conversion  for conversion, arguing that knowledge on the part of a defendant is not a required                                               4  section 496 claim in exchange for a waiver of costs and of the right to sue bith for malicious prosecution.  bith has not asserted otherwise.  7 disagree.  conversion is the wrongful exercise of dominion over the property of another.  (farmers ins. exchange v. zerin (1997) 53 cal.app.4th 445, 451 (zerin).)  the elements or disposition of property rights, and (3) damages.  (ibid.)  it is not necessary that there be a manual taking of the property, only an assumption of control or ownership over the property, or that the alleged converter has applied the property to his or her own use.  (id. at pp. 451-452.)  a mere contractual right of payment, without more, is insufficient.  (id. at p. 451.)  upon analysis, we conclude the trial court correctly ruled that bith failed to state a cause of action for conversion against mikail. a.  specifically identifiable funds  ction for conversion of money can be stated only where a defendant possessory interest in a specific, identifiable sum, such as kim v. westmoore partners, inc. (2011) 201 cal.app.4th 267, 284, and cases there cited.)  unless there is a specific, identifiable sum involved, such as when an agent accepts a sum of money to be paid to another and fails to make the payment, money cannot be the subject of a cause of action for conversion.  (mckell v. washington mutual, inc. (2006) 142 cal.app.4th 1457, 1491; see also pco, inc. v. christensen, miller, fink, jacobs, glaser, weil & shapiro, llp (2007) 150 cal.app.4th 384, 395 (pco, inc.).)  despite numerous opportunities to state a claim, bith in its third amended complaint failed to show it had title to specific, identifiable funds that it claims were attached to the third amended complaint, states that bith would deposit funds with made in the agreement as to what sardariani or axcess escrow was permitted or not  8 permitted to do with the funds, which bitbith.  there is no mention in the agreement of how the funds would be held by axcess escrow and no mention of downey savings at all.  in particular, there is no prohibition unds with other funds held by axcess escrow, nor any statement that any deposit of escrow funds at downey savings could not axcess escrow was obliged to hold the $2.5 million in a specific, separate account once the wire transfer was made is significant because of the nature of the relationship between a bank and its depositor.  in chazen v. centennial bank (1998) 61 cal.app.4th 532, 537, the court creditor as suchthe account of axcess escrow at downey savings, is in effect a loan to the bank, payable on demand by the depositor.  (morse v. crocker national bank (1983) 142 cal.app.3d the funds for its own business purposes.  [citations.]  the bank does not thereby act as (ibid.ibid.)  a general deposit is to be distinguished from a special deposit or a deposit for a special purpose.5  a deposit in a bank is general in the absence of an agreement or                                               5  in the case of a special deposit or a deposit for a special purpose, the depositor retains ownership of the funds and the transaction results in a trust or fiduciary relationship.  (van de kamp v. bank of america (1988) 204 cal.app.3d 819, 860; bank of america v. board of supervisors (1949) 93 cal.app.2d 75, 79.)  9 understanding that it should be special or circumstances that give the transaction the nature of a special deposit.  (bank of america v. board of supervisors, supra, 93 cal.app.2d at p. 79.)  no such agreement, understanding or special circumstance is alleged here.  title to the funds thus presumably passed to downey savings when the funds were deposited.  absent any showing to the contrary, the funds were then commingled the third amended complaint alleged that a conversion by mikail purportedly occurred on june 12, 2007, when $600,000 of the funds deposited with downey savings was purportedly wired by axcess escrow to accounts controlled by mikail and other defendants.6  thus, the third amended complaint failed to show bith had title to specific, identifiable funds that were purpo b.  immediate right to possession  the third amended complaint lacks another essential element of the tort of conversion, i.e., a showing that bith had an immediate right to possession of the thing converted at the time when the alleged conversion occurred.  (zerin, supra, 53 cal.app.4th at p. 451.)  bith provided funds to axcess escrow, which is alleged to have                                               6  in its reply brief, bith claims it alleged in its first amended complaint that $500,000 $500,000 transferred the $2.5 million into an escrow account with axcess escrow.  (italics added.)  however, the first amended complaint actually alleged in numerous places that other  . . . $600,000.00 to domestic banks [sic] accounts controlled by funds allegedly transferred appears to be undetermined, providing additional reason why claim for conversion.  (vu v. california commerce club, inc. (1997) 58 cal.app.4th 229, 235 [plaintiffs failed to identify specific, identifiable sums that card club took from them as result of cheating by other players]; software design & application, ltd. v. hoefer & arnett, inc. (1996) 49 from partnership accounts]; see pco, inc., supra, 150 cal.app.4th at p. 397 [plaintiffs could only estimate amount of cash contained in unknown number of bags removed from residence].)  10 deposited the funds into an account at downey savings.  as we have explained, ante, because that was a general deposit, title to the funds passed to downey savings, and the (id. at p. 452.)  the third amended complaint repeatedly characterizes the nature of -june 8, 2007, through june 29, 2007, and bith allegedly loaned sardariani $2.5 million on june 8, 2007, with the expectation that it would be repaid in full, with an additional   under the terms of the alleged escrow funding agreement, as of june 12, 2007 (the immediate possession of the funds it had loaned to sardariani, merely an expectancy of repayment in the future.  because bith lacked the right to immediate possession on the was stated under the alleged facts. c.  wrongful act  the trial court correctly noted that a conversion claim requires a wrongful act by the defendant at the time of the conversion, not merely a passive receipt of funds into an account.7  on appeal, bith asserts that an allegation that mikail agreed to accept the nduct on the part of mikail.8  (boldface and underscoring omitted.)  we disagree.                                               7   8  the trial court ruled such allegatpenal code section 496.  (see 2 witkin, cal. crim. law (3rd ed. 2000) crimes against property, § 81, p. 110; people v. scaggs (1957) 153 cal.app.2d 339, 352 [under when he first comes into possession of it, if he subsequently learns of its stolen nature  11  transferred into his account had been stolen from bith is a barren conclusion unsupported by allegations of fact.  and, our attention has been drawn to nothing in the third amended complaint or incorporated exhibits to support a finding that mikail engaged in wrongful conduct supporting a claim for conversion.  on appeal, bith relies on oakdale village group v. fong (1996) 43 cal.app.4th 539 (oakdale) in arguing that fraudulent scheme.  we find oakdale unpersuasive as applied to the present facts.  in oakdale, wang, a partner in a venture, sold a note belonging to the partnership without authorization.  wang then tendered the proceeds of the sale of the note to fong, in payment of a prior debt wang owed fong.  (oakdale, supra, 43 cal.app.4th at pp. 542-543.)  the partnership sued fong for conversion, and fong asserted he was an innocent purchaser for value and had no actual knowledge that wang was without authority to sell the partneid. at pp. 548-549.)  the appellate court held that fong could not rely on this defense because fong was not a purchaser for value.  the debt was owed by wang personally, not the partnership.  moreover, fong had constructive knowledge of the rights of the other partners as the same partnership agreement fong reviewed to determine whether wang had authority to dispose of the  other partners.9  (id. at pp. 547-549.)  here, mikail is not relying on the defense that he was an innocent purchaser for value.                                                                                                                                                    and then conceals or withholds it however, as noted previously, bith later voluntarily dismissed that claim in august 2009 eliminating the sole remaining cause of action against mikail. 9  even the appellate court in oakdale do not find fong automatically liable for conversion stemming from his receipt oakdale, supra, 43 cal.app.4th at p. 546, italics added.)  12  been stolen from bith is a naked conclusion or contention, not a factual allegation.  a collin v. american empire ins. co. (1994) 21 cal.app.4th 787, 812.)  to goods and to exercise ownership over them, or to prevent the owner from taking hus, a necessary element of the tort is an intent to exercise ownership over property which belongs to another.  for this reason, ibid.)  the third amended complaint does not show that mikail took any affirmative act with respect to the funds deposited into his account.  it fails to show any intentional, wrongful act of dominion   the trial court therefore properly dismissed the conversion cause of action. 2.  constructive trust  constructive trust solely because the claim was premised upon its claim for conversion.  bith argues that because the conversion claim was properly pleaded the trial court erred in sustaining the demurrer with respect to constructive trust.  bith further asserts that the claim for constructive trust was sufficient in that bith alleged (1) facts constituting the underlying cause of action and (2) specif  a constructive trust is not a true trust but rather an equitable remedy for a plaintiff who seeks recovery of specific property premised on fraud, breach of fiduciary duty or other act entitling the plaintiff to some relief.  (see 5 witkin, cal. procedure (5th ed. 2008) pleading, § 840, p. 255; bainbridge v. stoner (1940) 16 cal.2d 423, 428-429.)  a constructive trust may be imposed when there is a wrongful acquisition or detention by the defendant of property to which the plaintiff is entitled.  (zerin, supra, 53 cal.app.4th at p. 457; weiss v. marcus (1975) 51 cal.app.3d 590, 600.)  a plaintiff must plead some  13 underlying cause of action, such as fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of promise to buy property for the plaintiff or other basis for recovery that entitles the plaintiff to relief.  (see witkin, supra, at p. 255; michaelian v. state comp. ins. fund (1996) 50 cal.app.4th 1093, 1114.)  here, bith expressly based its cause of action for constructive trust, as applied to mikail, on its cause of action for conversion.  the third amended complaint states that  . . . mikail . . . based on the allegations use of action for conversion . . . conversion was the only basis on which bith premised its constructive trust cause of action against mikail.  the trial court properly determined that bith failed to state any claim for conversion against mikail, and therefore mikail had no obligation to hold the purportedly converted funds in trust for bith.  (zerin, supra, 53 cal.app.4th at p. 457.) 3.  unjust enrichment  as with a claim for constructive trust, there is no cause of action in california for a failure to make restitution under circumstances where it is equitable to do so.  (melchior v. new line productions, inc. (2003) 106 cal.app.4th 779, 793.)  it is synonymous with restitution.  (ibid.restitution if he or she is unjustly enriched at the expense of another.  [citations.]  a person is enriched if the person receives a benefit at a(mcbride v. boughton (2004) 123 cal.app.4th 379, 389, quoting first nationwide savings v. perry where the defendant obtained a benefit from the plaintiff by fraud, duress, conversion, or similar conduct.  in such cases, the plaintiff may choose not to sue in tort, but instead to seek restitution on a quasi-contract theory (an election referred to at common law as mcbride, supra, at p. 388.)  only if the circumstances are such as to make it unjust for the benefited person to retain the benefit is restitution required.  (id. at p. 389.)  14  nt had the same factual basis as its cause of action for conversion, and the trial court apparently found dismissal of the conversion claim made dismissal of the unjust enrichment claim appropriate as the circumstances were not such as to compel restitution.  even if the cause of action for receipt of stolen property under penal code section 496 might have supported an unjust enrichment claim, bith could not have been subsequently voluntarily dismissed the section 496 claim with prejudice. 4.  leave to amend  bith asserts that the trial court abused its discretion by failing to provide it with a chance to amend its claims against mikail.  bith argues that the trial court should have lthough bith asserts the third amended complaint was only its second attempt to state claims against defendants to recoup its loss.10  bith listed mikail as a named defendant in the second amended complaint, adding his name to its claims of fraud, conspiracy, violation of penal code section 496, unjust enrichment, conversion, common counts and constructive trust.   the trial court -page complaint was the allegation that money was transferred from a general bank account into the accounts of three people, one of whom was mikail.  that single allegation formed the basis for all of                                               10  actually, because bith originally named mikail as a doe defendant in the first amended complaint, bith has had three opportunities to state a cause of action against mikail.  15 pportunity to file a third  . . .  [¶]  . . .  [¶]  . . . i need to know the facts.  did mikail participate in some sort of a meeting?  was be kept in the case bith needed to alleged facts that clearly spelled out his role in the case, beyond simply owning a bank account into which some money was deposited.  in the third amended complaint, among other things, bith abandoned its claims against mikail for fraud and conspiracy and dropped his name from the list of defendants who allegedly had a role in defrauding it.  all bith offered in the pleading, however, account was stolen.  bith failed to request a further opportunity to amend and failed to indicate in what manner the pleading could be amended if leave were granted.  based on the totality of circumstances, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying bith leave to amend.  on appeal, bith asserts that the deficiencies of its pleading can readily be cured endment.  bith correctly argues that, even when no request to amend was made in the trial court, it is an abuse of discretion not to grant leave to amend if there is any reasonable opportunity the defect can be cured by amendment.  (goodman, supra, 18 cal.3d at p. 349.)  bith claims in its opening brief that it could amend the pleading simply by  sardariani to wanting, not facts.  in its reply brief, bith asserts the deficiencies could be resolved by an nst mikail.  such assurances  16 (goodman, supra, 18 cal.3d at p. 349.) disposition  the judgment is affirmed.  mikail is to recover costs on appeal.          flier, j. we concur:    bigelow, p. j.    rubin, j.  \n"

      "filed 12/24/19  in re chamberlain ca2/4 not to be published in the official reports  california rules of court, rule 8.1115(a), prohibits courts and parties from citing or relying on opinions not certified for publication or ordered published, except as specified by rule 8.1115(b).  this opinion has not been certified for publication or ordered published for purposes of rule 8.1115.  in the court of appeal of the state of california  second appellate district  division four   in re   lee chamberlain,   on habeas corpus.        b300885        (los angeles county        super. ct. no. ba198121)    original proceedings; petition for writ of habeas corpus.  craig j. mitchell, judge.  petition denied.  maureen l. fox, under appointment by the court of appeal, for defendant and appellant.  xavier becerra, attorney general, lance e. winters, chief assistant attorney general, susan sullivan pithey, michael r. johnsen and yun k. lee, deputy attorneys general, for plaintiff and respondent.      2  this matter is before us following the california supreme cour issuance of an order to show cause, returnable before this court, on  of habeas corpus.  the supreme court ordered the department of corrections and r is not entitled to relief pursuant to people v. gallardo (2017) 4 cal.5th 120 [(gallardo)], and why gallardo, supra, 4 cal.5th 120 should not apply retroactively on the decision in gallardo established a new rule for determining whether alleged prior convictions qualify to increase a defendan sentence.  gallardo overruled people v. mcgee (2006) 38 cal.4th 682 (mcgee)  as it authorizes trial courts to make findings about the conduct that  gave rise to a defendan prior   (gallardo, supra, at p. 134.)  rather, gallardo held that ]hile a sentencing court is permitted to identify those facts that were already necessarily found by a prior jury in rendering a guilty verdict or admitted by the defendant in entering a guilty plea, the court may not rely on its own independent review of record evidence to determine what conduct  led to the defendan conviction.  (id. at p. 124.)  division seven of this court recently held in in re milton (2019) __ cal.app.5th __ [dec. 3, 2019; 2019 djdar 11278] that gallardo does not apply retroactively to final judgments of conviction.  we agree with the milton  reasoning and conclusion.  moreover, even if gallardo were retroactive to final judgments, we conclude petitioner is not  3 entitled to relief under gallardo.  we discharge the order to show cause and deny the petition.   background the issues in this habeas petition arise from the trial cour determination, made as part of a judgment of conviction entered in 2000, that prior 1992 conviction of violating penal code section 245, subdivision (a)(1),1 qualified as a strike (former §§ 1170.12, subds. (a)(d), 667, subds. (b)(i)) and a serious felony (§ 667, subd. (a)(1)), because defendant personally used a deadly or dangerous weapon in committing the offense.  we explain the relevant background.   conviction and sentence  in 2000, a jury convicted petitioner of second degree robbery (§ 211), assault with a deadly weapon (§ 245, subd. (a)(1)), mayhem (§ 203), and torture (§ 206), with personal use of a deadly and dangerous weapon (§ 12022, subd. (b)) and infliction of great bodily injury (§ 12022.7, subd. (a)) in all counts.  the information also alleged two prior convictions as strikes and serious felonies:  a 1985 conviction of second degree robbery (§ 211), and the prior conviction at issue here, a 1992 conviction under former section 245, subdivision (a)(1), described in the information as th deadly weapon with gbi.  1  unspecified section references are to the penal code.   4 the jury found that petitioner had suffered the two prior convictions, and the trial court found that both qualified as strikes and serious felonies.  at that time, 1992 conviction under former section 245, subdivision (a)(1) could qualify as a serious felony and strike only if petitioner personally used a deadly or dangerous weapon during the offense, or if he personally inflicted great bodily injury on any person other than an accomplice.  (former § 1192.7, subds. (c)(8), (c)(23); see people v. ringo (2005) 134 cal.app.4th 870, 884 [crucial date for determining whether prior conviction qualifies is the date of the charged offense].)  in deciding the nature of the 1992 conviction, the trial court examined the preliminary hearing transcript from the 1992 case, and concluded that petitioner stabbed the victim, thus making the 1992 conviction a strike and a serious felony based on  the court sentenced petitioner to an overall term of 61 years to life.2    (b142144)  in  first direct appeal, b142144 (filed july 2001), we issued an unpublished opinion in which we reversed the trial cour finding that the 1992 conviction qualified as a strike and serious felony.   2  petitioner was sentenced as follows:  25 years to life for robbery; 25 years to life for assault with a deadly weapon; 1 year for use of a deadly weapon (§ 12022, subd. (b)(1)); and 10 years for two prior serious felony enhancements (§ 667, subd. (a)(1)).  the court imposed and stayed two terms of 25 years to life for mayhem and torture; three 1-year terms for use of a deadly weapon (§ 12022, subd. (b)(1)); and three 3-year terms for inflicting great bodily injury (§ 12022.7, subd. (a)).    5 because the 1992 prior conviction had resulted from a jury trial, not a guilty plea, we held that under people v. houck (1998) 66 cal.app.4th 350, the trial court had erred in relying on the preliminary hearing transcript rather than the trial transcript to ascertain the nature of the offense.  we remanded the matter for a retrial on the nature of the 1992 conviction, and for resentencing, but affirmed the judgment in all other respects.  petitions for review and writ of certiorari were denied in 2001 and 2002, respectively.   retrial on 1992 prior conviction and second appeal (b156417)  on remand, the trial court held a new trial on the nature of the 1992 conviction, again concluded that the conviction qualified as a strike and serious felony, and re-imposed the original sentence.  petitioner appealed for a second time.   as reflected in our unpublished opinion in that appeal, b156417 (filed december 2002), the trial court took judicial notice of three documents from the 1992 conviction:  the 1992 amended information, the jury verdict form, and the abstract of judgment.3  the trial court  3  we notified the parties of our intent to take judicial notice of the 1992 amended information, verdict form, abstract of judgment, and jury instructions that were refused, withdrawn, and given to the jury in case no. ba054760, as they appear in the trial court file in case no. ba198121.  petitioner objected to our taking judicial notice of the jury instructions on the grounds of relevance.  we overrule the objection and take judicial notice of the jury instructions, amended information, verdict form, and abstract of judgment.  (evid. code, § 452, subd. (d).)    6 summarized in our opinion, the trial court stated testimony showed that that the [petitioner]; that as a result of being stabbed by [petitioner], the victim was cut, received stitches, was sutured and at the time he testified, still bore a scar from the knife we also stated that [that petitioner] was found guilty in count 2 of adw with a knife, and that the trial court . . . count 2 of the information charged [that] the jury expressly found [petitioner] guilty of count abstract of judgment reflected [that] he was convicted of the crime in 4    in his direct appeal from the reinstated judgment, petitioner contended that the trial court erred in considering the transcript of the from the 1992 case, rather than considering the  4  the 1992 amended information alleged:  injury and with deadly weapon, in violation of penal code section 245(a)(1), a felony, was committed by [petitioner], who did willfully and unlawfully commit an assault upon [the victim] with a deadly weapon, to wit, knife, and by means of force likely to produce great bodily   petitioner] guilty of the crime of assult [sic] with a deadly weapon, to wit, a knife, in violation of section 245(a)(1) penal code, a felony, as charged in count 2 of the i  the abstract of judgment reflects petitioner was convicted in count 2    7 entire transcript of the trial.5  we disagreed, concluding that petitioner had failed to establish the relevance of the remainder of the trial testimony:  of the 1992 adw victim was sufficient to establish he was the one who used the knife during the apositively identified [petitioner] as the knife wielder, and his testimony established [that] accordingly, it was personal use of a dangerous and deadly weapon by showing that it was someone else, not he, who wielded that knife.  clearly, [petitioner] knew what his defense was in that matter.  if such defense primarily was that he was simply an aider and abettor, not the knife wielder, then it was incumbent on [petitioner] to point this out and to identify what evidence was presented to support such [a] defense.  this he did not do.  he therefore failed to show that any of the untranscribed portions of the 1992 oral tr we also noted, in any event, 1992 adw oral trial proceedings subsequently transcribed establish that [petitioner] did not rely on the defense that an accomplice, not he,  as we summarized:  a review of [the july 9, 1992 trial] transcript reflects that on that day the defense commenced and [petitioner] presented the testimony of two witnesses, ron carman, a los angeles county deputy probation officer, and rebecca schreiber, a  5  as of the time of the retrial on the 1992 conviction, only the trial testimony of the victim in that case had been transcribed.   8 public defender investigator.  carman essentially testified that he contacted the victim by telephone and prepared a report of his statements.  he did not testify as to what those statements were.  schreiber testified that she contacted josephine villalobos, a witness, by phone and that villalobos indicate[d] quite firmly she did not want to talk to [schreiber] because [she] was working with the defense, and her friend had been a victim of [petitioner].  [¶]  afterwards,  attorney informed the court and the prosecutor that  was the only remaining defense witness and that he would not be available until july 13, a monday.  he expected to examine martinez regarding the victims statements as recited in the police report, which were allegedly contradictory to the victims testimony and the testimony of another witness at trial regarding whether the victim walked up to or ran over to the police after the stabbing; whether the stabbing occurred in front of the bar or after the victim ran off; and how the victim was stabbed.  the court then continued the matter to july 13 to allow the defense to examine the officer.  the proceedings on july 13, 1992, and any proceedings thereafter were not transcribed.  petitions for writ of habeas corpus following the supreme cour decision in gallardo, petitioner filed petitions for writs of habeas corpus in the trial court and this court, arguing that his sentence was prohibited because it was based on a fact (i.e., personal use of a deadly weapon) the jury did not necessarily find in rendering its verdict.  after both petitions were denied,  9 petitioner filed a habeas petition in the supreme court.  the supreme court issued an order to show cause returnable to this court petitioner is not entitled to relief pursuant to [gallardo], and why gallardo . . . should not apply retroactively on habeas corpus to final    we agree with in re milton that gallardo does not retroactively apply to final convictions, and in the alternative find that petitioner is not entitled to relief under the rule of gallardo.  discussion  division seven of this court recently held that gallardo does not apply retroactively to convictions that became final before gallardo was decided.  (in re milton, supra, __ cal.app.5th __ [2019 djdar at p. 11280; 2019 wl 6485068] (milton).)  the milton court came to this conclusion under the framework of teague v. lane (1989) 489 u.s. 288, and in in re johnson (1970) 3 cal.3d 404.  (milton, supra, at pp. 1128111284 [teague analysis], 1128411285 [johnson analysis].)  the parties in this case agree teague and johnson dictate whether gallardo should be afforded retroactive application.    we agree with the milton court that gallardo should not be afforded retroactive effect because (1) gallardo stated a new procedural rule of criminal procedure that neither prevents an impermissibly large risk of an inaccurate conviction nor alters our understanding of the bedrock procedural elements essential to a fair proceeding (teague, supra, 489 u.s. at pp. 307, 311; schriro v. summerlin (2004) 542 u.s.  10 348, 352353); (2) gallardo is not intended to vindicate a right essential to the reliability of the fact-finding process, but is instead intended to limit the universe of information a court may consider when determining what a jury necessarily found in rendering its verdict (johnson, supra, 3 cal.3d at p. 411); (3) gallardo departed from the long-standing practice of reviewing the entire record of conviction to evaluate the nature of a prior offense (id. at p. 410); and (4) the effect of applying gallardo would be burdensome and could deprive criminal law of  of its deterrent  (teague, supra, 489 u.s. at p. 309; johnson, supra, 3 cal.3d at p. 410).   even if gallardo were retroactive to final judgments, petitioner is not entitled to relief under gallardo.  the sixth and fourteenth amendments of the united states constitution entitle a criminal defendant to  jury determination that [he] is guilty of every element of the crime with which he is charged, beyond a reasonable   (apprendi v. new jersey (2000) 530 u.s. 466, 477 (apprendi).)  a defendan sixth amendment right to a jury trial extends to  disputed facts that may not be formally designated as  of the offense, but nevertheless expose the defendant to additional   (gallardo, supra, 4 cal.5 at p. 128.)  in mcgee, supra, 38 cal.4th 682, the california supreme court ruled apprendi does not preclude a court from making sentencing determinations related to a defendan   (id. at p. 707.)  however,  inquiry is a limited one and must be based upon the record of the prior criminal  to determine  that  11 record is sufficient to demonstrate that the conviction is of the type that subjects the defendant to increased punishment under california   (id. at p. 706.)  in the event the elements do not resolve the issue of qualifying the offense as a serious felony, the trial court must examine the prior convictio record to assess whether that record reveals whether the conviction realistically may have been based on conduct that would not constitute a serious felony under california law  (ibid.)   in gallardo, our supreme court considered recent decisions by the united states supreme court (e.g., descamps v. united states (2013) 570 u.s. 254 (descamps); mathis v. united states (2016) 136 s.ct. 2243 (mathis)), and overruled mcgee  as it authorizes trial courts to make findings about the conduct that  gave rise to a defendan prior   (gallardo, supra, 4 cal.5th at p. 134.)    the defendant in gallardo was alleged to have suffered a prior strike based on her conviction for assault with a deadly weapon under a former version of section 245.  (gallardo, supra, 4 cal.5th at p. 123.)  the defendant had pleaded guilty to the assault but did not specifically admit that she used a deadly weapon when she entered her plea.  (id. at p. 136.)  a bench trial on the defendan prior conviction resulted in a true finding, but the trial cour  basis for concluding that defendant used a deadly weapon was a transcript from a preliminary   (id. at p. 136  in the record shows that defendant adopted the preliminary hearing testimony as supplying the factual basis for her guilty .)    12 after reviewing descamps and mathis, the gallardo court held that the trial court improperly relied on the preliminary hearing transcript to find a disputed fact about the conduct underlying defendan assault conviction that had not been established by virtue of the conviction   (gallardo, supra, 4 cal.5th at pp. 124125.)  the court explained that when the criminal law imposes added punishment based on findings about the facts underlying a defendan prior conviction, [t]he sixth amendment contemplates that a jurynot a sentencing courtwill find such facts, unanimously and beyond a reasonable   (descamps, supra, 570 u.s. at p. 269.)  (gallardo, supra, 4 cal.5th at p. 124.)  the court held that a court considering whether to impose an increased sentence based on a prior qualifying conviction may not determine the  or  of the prior conviction based on its independent conclusions about what facts or conduct  supported the conviction.  (mcgee, supra, 38 cal.4th at p. 706.)  that inquiry invades the jurys province by permitting the court to make disputed findings about what a trial showed, or a plea proceeding revealed, about the defendan underlying   (descamps, supra, at p. 269.)  the cour role is, rather, limited to identifying those facts that were established by virtue of the conviction itselfthat is, facts the jury was necessarily required to find to render a guilty verdict, or that the defendant admitted as the factual basis for a guilty   (gallardo, supra, 4 cal. 5th at p. 136.)  the court remanded the matter  permit the people to demonstrate to the trial court, based on the record of the prior plea proceedings, that  13 defendan guilty plea encompassed a relevant admission about the nature of her   (id. at p. 139.)   despite disapproving the trial cour reliance on the preliminary hearing transcript to make an independent determination of a disputed fact, gallardo did not designate or define the universe of documents a sentencing court may use to identify  facts . . . the jury was necessarily required to find to render a guilty   (gallardo, supra, 4 cal.5th at p. 136.)  instead, the court left intact earlier precedent that permits a sentencing court to review the evidence presented at trial (though not to make an independent factual determination as to the defendan conduct based on that evidence)  (e.g., people v. equarte (1986) 42 cal.3d 456 (equarte)), and to review prior appellate opinions (e.g., people v. trujillo (2006) 40 cal.4th 165; people v. woodell (1998) 17 cal.4th 448 (woodell)).   equarte is instructive.  the defendant in equarte argued his conviction for assault with a deadly weapon under former section 245, subdivision (a)(1), did not constitute a serious felony because  jury never found . . . that defendant had personally used a dangerous or deadly  one of the necessary elements of subdivision   (equarte, supra, 42 cal.2d at p. 466.)  finding no merit to defendan claim, the supreme court found there was   the trial court properly found personal use of a deadly weapon  the evidence at trial clearly demonstrated that there had been no accomplice in this   (id. at pp. 460, 467.)   14 in the present case, were gallardo to apply retroactively to  final judgment, the trial cour consideration of the amended information, verdict form, and judgment of conviction from the 1992 case would not be improper.  those documents are part of the record of conviction, and the trial court used them not to make an independent judgment as to the conduct that was realistically the basis of the conviction, but rather to show that in convicting petitioner, the jury necessarily found that the assault was committed with a deadly weapon, a knife.  indeed, the verdict form specifically recited that the jury found petitioner guilty of  crime of assult [sic] with a deadly weapon, to wit, a knife   the only remaining question under gallardo would be whether in convicting petitioner, the jury necessarily found that he personally used a knife, or whether the jury might have found him guilty on a theory of vicarious liability not involving personal use of the knife.  the trial court reviewed the transcript of the  testimony in the 1992 case.  to the extent the court considered that transcript to make an independent judgment that petitioner personally used a deadly or dangerous weapon based on disputed facts, that use could arguably violate gallardo.  but the record before us in this habeas proceeding establishes that, in fact, the  testimony at the 1992 trial was undisputed as to the fact that he was stabbed by one man, and that no other person was involved.  as we noted in our opinion in b156417, at the retrial whether the 1992 conviction qualified as a strike and serious felony, petitioner did not contend that there was evidence to suggest someone else used the knife.  more to the point, we noted that, in fact,  15 the available record of the 1992 trial established that there was no evidence presented to show that anyone other than the perpetrator who used the knife was involved in the assault.  to the contrary, the 1992 jury instructions required a finding  a reasonable doubt that the [petitioner] is the person who committed the crime with which he is charged.  [¶]  if, after considering the circumstances of the identification . . . you have a reasonable doubt whether [petitioner] was the person who committed the crime, you must give [him] the benefit of that doubt and find [him] not guilty.  (former caljic no. 2.91.)  in light of the jury instructions, the jury must have found petitioner was the person who used a deadly weapon, to wit, knife, during the assault.6 significantly, gallardo does not prohibit consideration of the evidence presented at the trial in which the prior conviction occurred, if that evidence was not disputed and, as such, necessarily demonstrates a fact the jury found in returning a guilty verdict.  here, as established by the entire record presented in this habeas corpus petition, there was no dispute at the trial resulting in the 1992 conviction that the perpetrator of the assault personally used a knife and had no accomplice.  hence, the record shows beyond any doubt that, in finding petitioner guilty of  with a deadly weapon, to wit, knife, the jury necessarily found the qualifying fact that petitioner personally used a deadly and dangerous weapon.  there is no other explanation for the  verdict.    6  none of the jury instructions, whether refused by the court, withdrawn by the parties, or given to the jury, set forth theories of aiding and abetting or vicarious liability.  16 therefore, on the record presented in this habeas corpus proceeding, the trial cour consideration of the  testimony from the 1992 trial does not entitle petitioner to relief under gallardo.  it was not error under the rule of gallardo, because, as now appears, the  testimony that there was only one perpetrator and no accomplice was undisputed at the 1992 trial, and consideration of that testimony demonstrates that the jury necessarily found petitioner personally used a deadly or dangerous weapon.  in the alternative, based on the same reasoning, any error under the rule of gallardo premised on the trial cour consideration of the  testimony to determine the conduct underlying the 1992 offense was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt:  there is no doubt that the jury in the 1992 trial found that petitioner personally used a deadly and dangerous weapon.  (chapman v. california (1967) 386 u.s. 18, 24 the beneficiary of a constitutional error [must] prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the error complained of did not contribute to the verdict obtained delaware v. van arsdall (1986) 475 u.s. 673, 681 an otherwise valid conviction should not be set aside if the reviewing court may confidently say, on the whole record, that the constitutional error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt // // // //  17 disposition the order to show cause is discharged, and petition for writ of habeas corpus is denied.   not to be published in the official reports           willhite, j.  we concur:     manella, p. j.     collins, j. \n"
