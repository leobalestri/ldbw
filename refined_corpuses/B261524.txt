(kongs, supra, 30 cal.app.4th at pp. 1747, 1753, fn. 4.) the trial court granted kongs, at pp. 1747-1748.) on appeal the defendant argued that because a 10-year-old girl and other child models depicted in photographs possessed by the defendant no sexual conduct can be found, regardless of id. at p. 1753.) kongs rejected the argument (kongs, supra, 30 cal.app.4th at pp. 1753-ferber case instructs us that states may legitimately protect the dignity and psychological well-being of children by forbidding child pornography. that purpose is served by construing penal code section 311.4 to encompass not only a nude exhibition of the pubic or rectal area, but, in appropriate cases- or bikini-clad pubic or section 311.4, subdivision (d). presumably, the legislature was aware that for some 9 -covered genitals are sexually stimulating.

(cf. people v. spurlock (2003) 114 cal.app.4th 1122, 1132 (spurlock).) (2) sufficient evidence supports aconviction on count 1. appellant concedes he was looking at the various images reproduced in exhibit no. 6 while on a computer at the library. appellant also concedes, the issue in this case is whether any or all of those images in the meaning of section 311.4(d)(italics added) but there is insufficient evidence that appellant we accept the concession and, for the reasons discussed below, reject the argument. pages containing a total of 29 photographs that were stored in the computer, several of which are collages with multiple photographs of the same or different girls, all of whom are clothed or partially-clothed prepubescent minor girls in highly suggestive poses. of the 29 photographs, 24 include the genital, pubic, and/or rectal areas . two additional photographs depict girls in underwear hugging or kissing each other. each of these two photographs shows, but does not particularly focus on, pubic areas.11 farino described the as depicting young girls wearing lingerie and, in some cases, no bottoms, in sexually provocative poses making their buttocks or genitalia the center focus. his description was accurate. the images include, for example, a girl lying down in a grassy area with legs spread, exposing her covered genital and pubic area; a smiling dark-haired girl lying on her left side, exposing her rectal area; another girl in blue shorts lying down with the focus on her covered genitalia, partially-covered pubic area, and exposed rectal area; and a smiling girl lying down with her legs raised in the air, again focusing on her covered genitalia, partially-covered pubic area, and exposed rectal area. 11 three photographs are head shots of a girl suggestively sucking something, licking something, or sticking out her tongue, respectively. these are relevant only to nstructional claim post. 12 the jury reasonably could have concluded any or all of the above described 26 photographs depicted sexual conduct as defined in section 311.4, subdivision (d)(1) genitals, pubic area, and/or rectal area in a sexually suggestive setting. as to each photograph, the setting was sexually suggestive because the setting is generally associated with sexual activity; the child is in an unnatural pose, or in inappropriate attire, considering the age of the child; the child is partially clothed; and/or the photograph is intended or designed to elicit a sexual response in the viewer. we have considered the kongs factors even though spurlock concluded section 311.4 does not mandate we do so for purposes of determining the sufficiency of the evidence. (spurlock, supra, 114 cal.app.4th at p. 1133.) citing kongs, spurlock simply a reasonable jury could determine, based on the overall content of the visual depiction and the context of ths conduct, taking into account the s age [citation], that the photograph [at issue] depicts an exhibition of the genitals for the purpose of sexual stimulation of the viewer. ( 311.4, subd. (d)(1).)spurlock, at p. 1133.) although not all of the 26 photographs particularly focus on genitals, the pubic area, or the rectal area, most of the girls are only partially clothed and many, including the girls hugging and kissing each other, are wearing age-inappropriate underwear that is plainly suggestive. as observed in kongsa photograph of tots posing suggestively while dressed in corsets, garters, and hosiery could well be considered lewd because such attire is so inappropriate to their age and is obviously designed to elicit a sexual response in a viewer. (kongs, supra, 30 cal.app.4th at p. 1753.) we conclude that, under either the spurlock or kongs standard, there was sufficient evidence to convince a rational trier of fact, beyond a reasonable doubt, appellant possessed child pornography in violation of section 311.11, subdivision (a) (count 1), including sufficient evidence of photographs depicting the meaning of that subdivision and section 311.4, subdivision (d)(1). (cf. ochoa, supra, 6 cal.4th at p. 1206; spurlock, supra, 114 cal.app.4th at pp. 1133-1134; see kongs, supra, 30 cal.app.4th at pp. 1756-1757.) 13 2. the court did not err in failing to give a unanimity instruction. appellant claims the trial court erred by failing to give a unanimity instruction as to count 1. although count 1 of the information charged appellant with violating section 311.11 based on possession of a single image (alleging he or controlled an image(italics added) in violation of section 311.1112) on or about february 19, 2014, the people presented evidence appellant retrieved multiple images and searched for images on the same library computer on two separate occasions (february 1, 2014, and february 19, 2014). , depicting 29 images retrieved from the library computer, was admitted into evidence.13 although the people did not formally designate any or all of the images in as the sole basis of proof on count 1, closing argument did not discuss any images other than the images in . the prosecutor, in cloimages in , fall within the statutory definition of sexual conduct], but you only have to find one. in california, one image, 100 images, 500 images, one charge. so long as you agree that at least one of those photos shows a child engaging [in] s attorney argued mischaracterized the burden of proof to the viewing and the argued, at 12 although counts 1 and 2 of the information charge a violation of section 311.11, subdivision (b), the information also contains handwriting (from an unidentified source) striking the reference to subdivision (b). the reference to subdivision (b) appears to be a typographical error because that subdivision addresses the punishment for a violation of section 311.11, subdivision (a) and the jury was instructed that the people charged a violation of subdivision (a). 13 although the record indicates a computer disc containing all 200 images retrieved from the library computer was admitted as 5, there is no indication the jury had a computer or any other means of viewing the images on the disk and it is not part of the record on appeal. 14 length, that the prosecutor failed to prove possession or intent. with respect to the images images were not unlawful because there were no pictures of nude children and no pictures where genitals were exposed. evidence establishes several acts, any one of which could constitute the crime charged, either the state must select the particular act upon which it relied for the allegation of the information, or the jury must be instructed that it must agree unanimously upon which act to base a verdict of guilty. (people v. jennings (2010) 50 cal.4th 616, 679 (jennings).) jennings veral exceptions to this rule. . . . there . . . is no need for a unanimity instruction if the defendant offers the same defense or defenses to the various acts constituting the charged crime. (ibid.) although the information charged appellant with possession of a single image, the people presented evidence he searched for images on two occasions and possessed multiple images on february 19, 2014. the people did not expressly select any single image for the jury to evaluate, nor did the people specify whether all of the images in were unlawful. under these circumstances, the court generally has a sua sponte obligation to give the unanimity instruction. (people v. castro (1901) 133 cal. 11, 13 [instruction required where information charged a single act of rape on a particular date but prosecution introduced a series of acts of sexual intercourse on various dates without selecting the particular act relied on]; people v. crawford (1982) 131 cal.app.3d 591, 596 [reversing for failure to instruct on unanimity because [convicting defendant of possession of a firearm] might have been convinced defendant possessed one [of four weapons recovered in his home], while others were convinced he possessed another weapon without all ].) however, as noted above, our supreme court has concluded the unanimity instruction is not necessary, or constitutes harmless error, if the defenses to all of the multiple acts are the same. (jennings, supra, 50 cal.4th at p. 679; see people v. diedrich 15 (1982) 31 cal.3d 263, 282-283 [failure to instruct can be harmless error where the defendant offers the same defense to all criminal acts and s verdict implies that it did not believe the only defense offered]; people v. parsons (1984) 156 cal.app.3d 1165, 1174 [failure to instruct on unanimity is harmless error where defendant proffered no defense to receiving various items of stolen property and simply put the people to their proof]; people v. gonzalez (1983) 141 cal.app.3d 786, 792, fn. 6 [error can be harmless where ]; cf. people v. castaneda (1997) 55 cal.app.4th 1067, 1071 [reversing for failure to give unanimity instruction on possession of narcotics charge where jury heard evidence of two acts (heroin discovered ) and appellant defense was the television heroin belonged to his son and the coin pocket heroin was planted].) as was his right, appellant presented no defense witnesses in his case in chief. his with respect to the content of addressed, at length, the peoplefailure to prove intent and possession of all of the images without mentioning any particular image or distinguishing among them. the only comment about the content of the images was noncontroversial. that is, counsel correctly stated in closing argument none of the depicted minors who were nude or engaging in sex. these stated facts were not disputed at trial and are confirmed by the record. the trial court did not err by failing to give a unanimity instruction. (jennings, supra, 50 cal.4th at p. 679.) in people v. vargas (2001) 91 cal.app.4th 506, 556-557, the court evaluated the prejudice of a unanimity instructional error by applying the standard enunciated in people v. watson (1956) 46 cal.2d 818 (watson), i.e., whether it is reasonably probable a result more favorable to the appealing party would have been reached absent the error, noting that unanimity is a state constitutional requirement rather than a federal due process requirement. in people v. thompson (1995) 36 cal.app.4th 843, the court applied the standard in chapman v. california (1967) 386 u.s. 18, 24 (chapman) to 16 that defendant (thompson, at p. 853.) we conclude that, even if the trial court erred by failing to give a unanimity instruction, it is not reasonably possible any juror could have concluded any of the three headshots exhibit no. 6 depicted genitals, the pubic area, or the rectal area; therefore, there was no need for a unanimity instruction as to those headshots. with regard to the remaining photographs, the question before the jury was a yes or no determination whether a particular photograph or all of the photographs included images depicting genitals, the pubic area, and/or the rectal area. as noted above, we have reviewed the remaining 26 photographs and have determined all of them include images of genitals, the pubic area, and/or the rectal area. based on the record of the case as presented to the jury and the content of the 26 photographs, there is no reason to believe, and no basis in the record to suggest, the jurors did not determine all 26 photographs depicted sexual conduct as defined in section 311.4, subdivision (d)(1) or that the jury might have reached a different conclusion if the court had given a unanimity instruction. therefore, applying either the watson or chapman standard, we conclude any instructional error was harmless. 17 disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports hogue, j. we concur: aldrich, acting p. j. lavin, j. judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
