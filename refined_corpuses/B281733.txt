(a)) and count 2 transporting marijuana (health & saf. code,  11360, subd. (a)) with admissions he suffered a strike (pen. code,  667, subd. (d)), served a prior prison term (pen. code,  667.5, subd. (b)), and was released on bail or on his own recognizance when he committed the offenses (pen. code,  12022.1). 3 encing and related proceedings. on november 30, 2016, appellant filed a health and safety code section 11361.8, subdivision (a) (proposition 64)3 petition for resentencing on count 2. on december 22, 2016, the court considered the petition and, pursuant to stipulation, reduced 28, 2017, the court sentenced appellant to prison for six years on count 1 (the three-year upper term, doubled by the strike) with a six-month concurrent term on count 2 with credit for time served. appellant argues the trial court, by resentencing appellant to the upper term on count 1, abused its discretion. we reject the argument. discussion the court properly resentenced appellant to the upper term on count 1. 1. no sentencing error occurred. reviewed for abuse of discretion and will not be disturbed on reasonable person could agree wi (people v. nicolas 3 , also] added health and safety code sect-related resentence the person in accordance with the amended statute. [citation.] if an inmate files such a petition and satisfies the statutory determines that granting the petition would pose an unreasonable risk people v. rascon (2017) 10 cal.app.5th 388, 392393.) 4 (2017) 8 cal.app.5th 1165, 1182 (nicolas).) it is the burden of the complaining party to demonstrate the sentencing choice was irrational or arbitrary. (people v. carmony (2004) 33 cal.4th 367, 376.) lesopravsky maintains that the trial court abused its that the conduct posed a danger to people and property constituted an improper basis to impose the high term because felony evading requires driving a vehi4 (italics added.) lesopravsky principally relies on california rules of court, former rule 4.420(d), which states in relevant part: an element of the crime upon which punishment is being imposed may not be us here the facts surrounding the charged offense exceed the minimum necessary to establish the elements of the crime, the trial court can use such evidence to aggravate the sentence.(people v. castorena (1996) 51 cal.app.4th 558, 562.) the trial court expressly found that this was no ordinary evading arrest. at the sentencing hearing, urged the court to impose the middle term on count 1, arguing court replied, [t]he only problem is, [defense counsel], that the present 4 respondent maintains appellant forfeited this argument by failing to raise the issue below. there is no need to reach the forfeiture claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. (see people v. turner (1990) 50 cal.3d 668, 708.) 5 case involves a high-speed pursuit in an attempt to get rid of the evidence that was in the vehicle. and that put the lives of all the people on that freeway and on the streets in significant danger. conduct in this case was egregious. not the marijuana conduct, but the totality of the occurrence. the conduct; the police approaching; the defendant fleeing; and the high-speed pursuit that ensued while he tried to get rid of the ultimately, the resentencing court concluded that appeconduct overall . . . warranted the high term (cal. rules of court, former rule 4.408(a).) appellant attempted to flee from police during a high-speed pursuit through city streets and on a freeway. during the pursuit, appellant made an unsafe right turn onto devonshire in violation of vehicle code section 22107. on the freeway, he drove at unsafe speeds, over 80 miles per hour, in violation of vehicle code section 22350, and made at least two unsafe lane changes, swerving in and out of traffic, in violation of vehicle code section 21658. while driving unsafely in traffic on the freeway, he drove all the way to the shoulder. these were four separate violations assigned a traffic violation point count and implicating within the meaning of vehicle code section 12810, subdivision (f) (see people v. leonard (2017) 15 cal.app.5th 275, 280282), i.e., more than the three violations required by vehicle code sections 2800.2, subdivision (b) and 12810. 6 diminishing further whatever control appellant had of his vehicle, he threw out of its passenger window what appeared to be a pipe. the manner in which appellant drove and the four qualifying traffic violations constituted facts exceeding the wanton disregard for the sa under vehicle code sections 2800.2, subdivision (b) and 12810. the trial court was not obligated to ignore the subsequent ehicle code section 2800.2, subdivision (a); otherwise no aggravation could occur no matter how long such a pursuit continued or how many traffic offenses ensued. thus, the trial court did not engage in impermissible dual use of facts to impose the sentence on count 1 and the upper term on that count, nor did the court improperly consider the term. 2. any sentencing error was not prejudicial. even if the court erred by relying on the circumstances of the offense to impose the upper term on count 1, it does not follow the case must be remanded for resentencing. a single aggravating circumstance is sufficient for a trial court to select the upper term. (nicolas, supra, 8 cal.app.5th at p. 1182.) the court expressly stated multiple factors supported its reason for imposing the upper term. he has been to state prison. he has been on probation. at the time of the crime he was on felony probation (italics added.) the court continuedof harm to the community and the public by virtue of his reckless 7 conduct. i did mention at the time that he was on bailrecall if he was. i thought he had the two cases and he was on bail.[5] but in any event, i think there are enough factors to justify and warrant the high term which was, in fact, the way the (italics added.) and being out on bail when he committed this offense imposition of the upper term. appellant also argues criminal history does not present sufficiently aggravating circumstances to support the imposition of (italics added.) we reject the argument. there is no dispute appellant had been to prison (cal. rules of court, rule 4.421(b)(3)) and was on felony probation at the time of the present offenses (id., (b)(4)).6 5 appellant, in fact, admitted the penal code section 12022.1 enhancement allegation in this case that he was released on bail or on his own recognizance when he committed the present offenses, but the court did not impose the enhancement. the fact he was on bail or on his own recognizance when he committed the present offenses was a valid aggravating factor. (people v. combs (1986) 184 cal.app.3d 508, 511.) 6 the probation report reflects appellant was sentenced to prison in february and june 1994 for felony violations of penal code sections 475, subdivision (a) and 459, respectively, and, in 2005, for a felony violation of health and safety code section 11377, subdivision (a). on obstructing or resisting an executive officer (pen. code,  69; case no. 10wf0923) and he was on probation in that case when he committed the present offenses. 8 further, other aggravating factors were available. at resentencing, the court could have imposed consecutive instead of concurrent sentences on counts 1 and 2 (cal. rules of court, rule 4.421(a)(7)). the probation report reflects appellant suffered four felony convictions and 10 misdemeanor convictions, i.e., he had numerous adult convictions (id., (b)(2)). the report also reflects appellant committed new offenses while on probation granted in numerous cases (id., (b)(5)). in light of the above, even if the trial court erred by resentencing appellant to the upper term on count 1, any error was harmless. (see people v. avalos (1984) 37 cal.3d 216, 233; people v. watson (1956) 46 cal.2d 818, 836.) it is not reasonably probable that, following a remand, the court would do anything other than simply realign available aggravating factors to impose an upper term on count 1. (cf. people v. edwards (1993) 13 cal.app.4th 75, 80; people v. porter (1987) 194 cal.app.3d 34, 39.) conclusion. 9 disposition the resentencing order is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports kalra, j. we concur: edmon, p. j. egerton, j. * judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
