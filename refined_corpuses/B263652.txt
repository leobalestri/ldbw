(b)-(i), 1170.12, subds. (a)-(d))1 after a jury convicted him in 1998 of being a felon in possession of a firearm (former  12021, subd. (a)(1)). after proposition 36 was enacted in 2012, defendant petitioned to have his indeterminate life sentence recalled under section 1170.126, and his gun possession offense and therefore ineligible for relief under proposition 36. factual and procedural background -in-law, eugene payne seat. both men were ordered by officers at gunpoint to put their hands in the air. eugene immediately complied, but defendant kept his hands down, moving them outside of the view of the officers. [] eventually, both defendant and eugene were removed from the car. officers recovered a loaded chrome .380 semiautomatic pistol from an area under the right rear passenger seat. defendant told officer michael shimkus the gun had been handed to him by a motel occupant, who told him to hide the gun. eugene told officer your g667, subds. (b)-(i), 1170.12, subds. (a)-(d)), and was sentenced to an indeterminate prison term of 25 years to life. in 2012, the voters enacted proposition 36, which 1 all further statutory references are to the penal code. 3 strike is a serious and/or violent felony or where the offender is not eligible for a determinate sentence based on other disqualifying factors. (pen. code,  667, subd. (e)(2)(c), 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(c).) [proposition 36] also enacted section 1170.126, establishing a procedure for an offender serving an indeterminate life sentence for a third strike conviction that is not defined as a serious and/or violent felony to file a petition for recall of sentence. teal v. superior court (2014) 60 cal.4th 595, 596-597, fn. omitted.) after proposition 36 was enacted, defendant filed a petition to recall his indeterminate sentence. after briefing and a hearing at which the trial court accepted into evidence transcripts from the 1998 criminal trial and a copy of our 1999 opinion affirming the judgment, the court denied the petition, finding defendant was ineligible for relief under proposition 36 because he was armed with a firearm. ( 667, subd. (c)(2)(c)(iii), 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(c)(iii), 1170.126, subd. (e)(2).) discussion criteria set forth in proposition 36. he argues that nothing in the statutory language disqualifies a defendant who is serving a sentence based solely on a charge of gun possession. ( 667, subd. (c)(2)(c)(iii); 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(c)(iii); see  1170.126, subd. (e)(2).) consistent with published opinions from the third, fourth, and fifth postjudgment order. ( 1237, subd. (b); teal v. superior court, supra, 60 cal.4th at p. 601.) erpreting a voter initiative . . . we apply the same principles that govern statutory construction. [citation.] [citation.] the statutory language must also be construed in the context of the statute as a whole and the overall statutory scheme [in light of the electorates intent]. [citation.] 4 to other indicia of the voters intent, particularly the analyses and arguments contained in [citation.] ipurpose is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the voters who passed the initiative (people v. briceno (2004) 34 cal.4th 451, 459; accord, people v. park (2013) 56 cal.4th 782, 796.) section 1170.126, subdivision (e), sets forth eligibility criteria that a defendant must meet in order to be resentenced under proposition 36. a defendant is only eligible for resentencing if he or she is serving an indeterminate term of life imprisonment imposed pursuant to paragraph (2) of subdivision (e) of section 667 or subdivision (c) of and/or violent felonies by subdivision (c) of section 667.5 or subdivision (c) of section ( 1170.126, subd. (e)(1).) a defendant is not eligible for resentencing if the indeterminate term was imposed for an offense where current offense, the defendant used a firearm, [or] was armed with a firearm . . . ( 667, subd. (e)(2)(c)(iii); 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(c)(iii); see  1170.126, subd. (e)(2).) mean having a firearm available for use, either offensively or defensively. [citations.] (people v. blakely (2014) 225 cal.app.4th 1042, 1051-1052 (blakely).) this definition applies to the arming exclusion to resentencing eligibility at issue in this case. (ibid.) wconvicted under the pre-proposition 36 version of the three strikes law as a third strike offender of possession of a firearm by a felon was armed with the firearm during the commission of that offense, the armed-with-a-firearm exclusion applies and the defendant is not entitled to resentencing relief . . . . (people v. white (2014) 223 cal.app.4th 512, 519 (white).) it is clear from the record that at the time police encountered defendant, he had a available for use, either offensively or defensivelyblakely, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1051.) when officers first found defendant in the right rear passenger seat of his brother-in-defendant and his brother-in-law to put their hands in the air. defendant kept his hands 5 down, and after he was removed from the car, officers found a gun in an area under the right rear passenger seat. the court correctly found that defendant was ineligible for resentencing under proposition 36 because he was armed with a firearm. defendant acknowledges that there have been several published opinions from the third, fourth, and fifth district courts of appeal rejecting his argument. (see, e.g., people v. hicks (2014) 231 cal.app.4th 275, 283-284; people v. brimmer (2014) 230 cal.app.4th 782, 797-799; people v. elder (2014) 227 cal.app.4th 1308, 1312-1314; blakely, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at pp. 1054-1057; people v. osuna (2014) 225 cal.app.4th 1020, 1030-1038; white, supra, 223 cal.app.4th at p. 519.) defendant contends that each of these cases is either distinguishable or wrongly decided. we are not persuaded. disposition the order denying the petition for resentencing is affirmed. kriegler, j. we concur: turner, p. j. baker, j.
