(pen. code,  1210.1.)1 prior to entering his plea, defendant signed an advisement of rights, waiver and plea form (plea form) specifying, among other 1 all further statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise indicated. 3 set aside the conviction and dismiss the charges,did not relieve defendant of the duty to disclose the conviction if he applied to be a peace officer or for a state license, or if he sought to contract with the state lottery or serve on a jury. the [his] guilty . . . plea will result in [his] deportation (removal), exclusion from admission to the united states, or denial of a spanish-language translator read the plea form to defendant and defendant initialed next to each of the above stated advisements. defendant then entered his plea of guilty, and the court accepted the plea.2 on august 12, 2008, the trial court sentenced defendant to three years of formal probation so that he could participate in the proposition 36 program for two different convictionsnamely, (1) his 2008 conviction and (2) a 2006 conviction for which defendant had previously been placed on (but not successfully completed) deferred entry of judgment ( 1000 et seq.), which is a different drug rehabilitation program. fourteen months later, on october 4, 2009, the trial court found that defendant had successfully completed the proposition 36 drug treatment program, and consequently set aside 2 although the minute order from that colloquy indicates that defendant was informed have the consequences of deportation, exclusion from admission to the united states, or denial of 4 c. subsequent arrest and immigration proceedings in 2013, defendant was arrested for another drug-related crime. because defendant is not a united states citizen, immigration proceedings were initiated against him in 2013. ii. procedural background in june 2018, defendant filed a motion to vacate his 2008 plea on the grounds that (1) he did not receive the advisements required by section 1016.5, and (2) the attorney who represented him during the plea was constitutionally ineffective.3 in his motion, defendant argued that he had received deficient advisements and advice about the immigration consequences of his plea because he was never explicitly toldby either the court or his attorneythat those consequences would remain even if his conviction was dismissed under proposition 36. along with his motion, defendant submitted a declaration attesting that (1) his lawyer both never spoke with him and spoke with him and told him to take the deal, and (2) defendant would not have pled guilty had he known that dismissal under proposition 36 did not wipe away the immigration consequences of his plea. the trial court denied the motion to vacate. the court section 1016.5 argument because defendant had received the advisements required by that section. the court argument because (1) defendant did not seek relief until five years after removal proceedings had been initiated, rendering his motion to vacate untimely, and (2) defendant did not receive 3 defendant filed motions to vacate in january 2018 and march 2018, but each motion was taken off calendar without any ruling. 5 advisement than was required [and] that put him on notice that ty. in coming to these declaration not to be credible. defendant filed a timely notice of appeal. discussion section 1016.5 effective assistance of counsel. each is a distinctive legal ground with its own legal standard. we must accordingly evaluate each ground separately. we review the denial of a motion to vacate under section 1016.5 for an abuse of discretion (people v. limon (2009) 179 cal.app.4th 1514, 1517-1518), but evaluate a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel de novo subject to reviewing subsidiary factual findings for substantial evidence (people v. ogunmowo (2018) 23 cal.app.5th 67, 76 (ogunmowo)). i. section 1016.5 section 1016.5 requires a trial court, before accepting a plea to a criminal charge, to advise a defendant that his or her consequencesnamely, deportation (which is now called authorizes a defendant to file a motion to vacate the ensuing plea. ( 1016.5, subd. (b).) to prevail on a statutory motion to vacate under sadvisements were not given; (2) that the conviction may result in adverse immigration consequences; and (3) that the defendant would not have pled guilty or no contest had [the] proper 6 people v. arriaga (2014) 58 cal.4th 950, 957-958; people v. totari (2002) 28 cal.4th 876, 881.) the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying section 1016.5 because defendant was given the proper advisements. both the plea form defendant signed and the minute order from the plea colloquy established that defendant was advised that deportation, exclusion or denial of naturalization would follow from his plea. (people v. araujo (2016) 243 cal.app.4th 759, 763.) this is all ssection 1016.5 to require a trial court to discuss the further nuances and complexities of immigration consequences for pleas that may be later withdrawn goes beyond s mandate. (see ibid. [rejecting argument that section 1016.5 requires court to make advisements beyond those expressly set forth in that section]; people v. chien (2008) 159 cal.app.4th 1283, 1288 [narrowing s ii. ineffective assistance of counsel draised as a basis for relief in a motion brought under section 1473.7. ( 1473.7, subd. (a)(1).) an attorney provides constitutionally ineffective assistance if (1) her representation was deficient, and (2) prejudice flows from that deficient representation. (strickland v. washington (1984) 466 u.s. 668, 687.) we need not confront whether the performance of deficient for misadvising him that the immigration consequences 7 of his plea would outlast any proposition 36 dismissal because his claim fails for two other, independent reasons.4 section 1473.7 requires (a) & (b) fter the latter people v. espinoza (2018) 27 cal.app.5th 908, 914 [noting that a swas embroiled in immigration proceedings in 2013, yet waited until 2018 to file his motion to vacate. because no final removal order has issued, this five year delay renders any section 1473.7 motion untimely.5 4 our decision not to address the deficient performance statutes, such as proposition 36, calling for the subsequent dismissal of a conviction, has been rebutted ( 1473.7, subd. (e)(2)), or (2) tion that his personal knowledge . 5 because defendant does not expressly invoke section 1473.7 in his motion, we do not measure the timeliness of his petition against when that section was enacted (in january 2017). even if we did, his petition is still untimely given that defendant knew all of the facts underlying his claim for at least three years by january 2017. 8 second, defendant has not established that he was immigration consequences. ( 1473.7, subd. (e)(1) [burden of proof rests with movant].) to begin, defendant has not established that the 2008 conviction at issue here is what is at issue in the pending immigration proceedings. defendant has two (and potentially three) other drug convictionsa 2004 misdemeanor conviction for possessing a controlled substance, a 2006 misdemeanor conviction for the same (which, as noted above, was converted to a proposition 36 probation and later dismissed), and whatever grew out of the 2013 drug-related arrest. if the immigration proceedings would have been initiated or resolved in the same way with or without this conviction, any misadvisement regarding this conviction was not prejudicial. defendant has not filled this evidentiary gap. further, and more to the point, defendant has not misadvisement under the usual test for ineffective assistance of counsel. (strickland, supra, 466 u.s. at p. 687.) when a defendant alleges ineffective assistance that resulted in a plea, have pleaded guilty and would have insisted [up]on going to lee v. united states (2017) 137 s.ct. 1958, 1965 (lee), quoting hill v. lockhart he would have pleaded but for [s] [the] id. at p. 1967.) such evidence includes: (1) the likelihood that defendant 9 would prevail at trial (because a case with overwhelming evidence ostensibly provides strong incentive to enter a plea notwithstanding the immigration consequences), (2) the comparative punishment defendant faced after a plea vis--vis after a trial (because a greater dichotomy in potential sentences ostensibly provides strong incentive to enter a plea notwithstanding the immigration consequences), and (3) whether the defendant, contemporaneous with the plea, expressed that immigration consequences were important to his decision-making process (because the absence of such contemporaneous statements ostensibly shows that the immigration consequences did not matter to his decisional calculus). (id. at pp. 1966-1967.) although defendant makes, in his declaration, a post hoc assertion that he would not have pled guilty had he known that his plea would have resulted in his deportation, he has offered no contemporaneous evidence to support that assertion. defendant was not likely to prevail at trial because he was found in possession of methamphetamine and thereafter admitted it was his. defendant faced up to three years in prison for felony possession of contraband if convicted at trial (health & safety code,  11377, subd. (a)), while the proposition 36 plea offered him probation and the opportunity for dismissal of his conviction should he successfully complete the proposition 36 program. and defendant points to nothing in the record indicating that, back in 2008, he had any concern whatsoever about the immigration consequences of his plea. in short, defendant has not carried his representation affected his decision to plead guilty. 10 disposition the order is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. ______________________, j. hoffstadt we concur: _________________________, p. j. lui _________________________, j. ashmann-gerst
