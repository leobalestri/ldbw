(people v. chavez (mar. 8, 2016, b265801) [nonpub. opn.].) on october 11, 2016 chavez, representing himself, moved to vacate the july 6, 2015 order on the ground his appointed counsel was constitutionally ineffective in failing to argue that a 3 equal protection pursuant to people v. noyan (2014) 232 cal.app.4th 657. the trial court denied the motion.1 discussion we appointed counsel to represent chavez on this appeal. after examination of the record counsel filed an opening brief in which no issues were raised. on may 17, 2017 we advised chavez he had 30 days within which to submit any contentions or issues he wished us to consider. we have received no response. in people v. noyan, supra, 232 cal.app.4th at pages 663-664 the court held there was no rational basis for excluding from county jail sentencing (rather than state prison sentencing) under penal code section 1170, subdivision (h), defendants who bring alcohol or a noncontrolled substance or related paraphernalia into a custodial facility, when similarly situated defendants who bring a controlled substance or related paraphernalia into such a facility are eligible for county jail sentencing. because this difference violated equal protection, the court modified penal code section 4573.5 so that it included the county jail provision of penal code section 1170, subdivision (h). the equal protection issue of noyan has no bearing on the trial previously concluded was proper. (see people v. chavez, supra, b265801, at p. 2.) we have examined the entire record and are satisfied late attorney has fully complied with the 1 motion to vacate a postjudgment order, rather than a petition for writ of habeas corpus, was properly before the superior court and whether its denial is properly raised by appeal. (see people v. totari (2002) 28 cal.4th 876, 882.) 4 responsibilities of counsel and no arguable issue exists.
