(a), (c)(1)). pursuant to a negotiated disposition, gomez was sentenced to five years in prison. he contends the trial court violated his sixth amendment rights by denying his requests to represent himself. we affirm. procedural background 1. charges, plea, and appeal. an information filed on november 19, 2009, charged gomez with one count of continuous sexual abuse of a child under the age of 14 years ( 288.5, subd. (a)) and seven counts of committing a lewd act upon a child ( 288, subds. (a), (c)(1)).1 on may 28, 2010, pursuant to a plea agreement, gomez pleaded no contest to four counts of committing a lewd act, and the remaining counts were dismissed. the trial court sentenced gomez to five years in prison. it imposed a restitution fine, a suspended parole restitution fine, court security assessments, criminal conviction assessments, and a sex offender fine. as discussed in more detail post, between july 2009 and may 28, 2010 gomez made five marsden requests2 to replace his court appointed counsel and two purported faretta requests3 to represent himself, which were denied. after his plea and conviction he filed a notice of appeal contending, among other things, that the trial court erred by denying his faretta motions. the trial court granted a certificate of probable cause. 2. marsden and faretta requests below. on july 9, 2009, prior to the preliminary hearing, the trial court held a marsden 1 because the facts relating to the charged crimes are not relevant to the issues presented on appeal, we do not recite them here. (people v. white (1997) 55 cal.app.4th 914, 916, fn. 2.) 2 people v. marsden (1970) 2 cal.3d 118. 3 faretta v. california (1975) 422 u.s. 806. 3 complained that his attorney had waived time for the preliminary hearing contrary to his with him. the trial court observed that it had found good cause for a continuance of the discussing the issues with gomez and counsel, the trial court denied the motion. on september 21, 2009, the trial court entertained a second marsden motion. among other things, gomez complained that he did not believe counsel was acting in his best interests; the case was not moving forward at a suitable pace; and counsel had not provided him with transcripts of all court proceedings, to which he believed he was entitled. the trial court explained that transcripts were not available without justification, which gomez had not provided. after discussing the matters raised with counsel, the court denied the motion. the court advised gomez that he had the right to retain a private lawyer. gomez said he would do so. on october 7, 2010, the trial court heard a third marsden motion. gomez stated, -[ap]pointed lawyer. since the first day we agreement with everything. we always have arguments over the issues raised with comotion. gomez pro 4 mak[ing] subsequent to the preliminary hearing, the court held another marsden hearing on marsdens why is that everything i ask him or we talk about, we argue [about] everything. we of interest, your honor, between what gomez and counsel disagreed about, gomez complained that at his last video conference with counsel, the video screen had gone blank in the middle of the explained that he had accidentally pushed the wrong button on the video system. gomez t this guy defending me. i no -representation. after addressing the issues raised with counsel and gomez, the trial court denied the motion. ard another marsden motion. gomez gave the court a letter that apparently detailed his concerns, which the court sealed. the following discussion transpired: ready to go to trial. i understand that. [] but i really would like somebody else to come in and evaluate my case, another lawyer that i know will have a better outlook than [existing counsel] has. and i know he can help me and maybe at it in a different way . . . that would be more helpful to me than what [counsel] has been. [] and he 5 me . . . to exercise my faretta rights if you can please give me paperwork so i can appeal this case because i know i have grounds to appeal for due have other grounds thatthat i know i can appeal this case, your honor, after i take the deal, sir. the trial court denied the marsden -representation the court and parties then turned to the question of a plea agreement. the nt that or agreed to issue a certificate of probable cause. gomez then pleaded no contest as detailed ante. discussion lf-representation requests. a criminal defendant has a constitutional right to counsel at all critical stages of a criminal prosecution. (people v. doolin (2009) 45 cal.4th 390, 453; people v. tena (2007) 156 cal.app.4th 598, 604.) the right to counsel may be waived by a criminal defendant who elects to represent himself at trial. (faretta v. california, supra, 422 u.s. at pp. 807, 834-835; people v. doolin, supra, -representation is absolute, but only if a request to do so is knowingly and voluntarily made and if asserted a reasonable time before trial begins. otherwise, requests for self-representation people v. doolin, supra, at p. 453; people v. lynch (2010) 50 cal.4th 693, 721-723; people v. windham (1977) 19 cal.3d 6 121, 128-129; people v. tena, supra, a request for self-people v. doolin, supra, at p. 453; people v. marshall (1997) 15 cal.4th 1, 22-23.) a motion made in passing anger or frustration, an ambivalent motion, or one made for the purpose of delay or to frustrate the orderly administration of justice may be denied. (people v. marshall, supra, at p. 23.) courts (id. at p. 20; people v. tena, supra, at p. 604.) on review, we independently examine the entire record to determine whether a defendant knowingly and intelligently invoked his or her right to self-representation. (people v. doolin, supra, 45 cal.4th at p. 453; people v. stanley (2006) 39 cal.4th 913, 932.) the erroneous denial of a timely, unequivocal faretta motion made by a competent defendant is constitutional error and requires reversal per se. (people v. nicholson (1994) 24 cal.app.4th 584, 594.) a. neither self-representation request was unequivocal. faretta requests were properly denied because, considering the totality of the circumstances, neither was unequivocal. -representation is waived unless defendants articulately and unmistakably demand to proceed pro se. people v. stanley, supra, 39 cal.4th at p. 932.) when determining whether a faretta request is unequone made people v. tena, supra, 156 cal.app.4th at p. 607; people v. marshall, supra, 15 cal.4th at pp. 21, 23.) -representation may occur where the defendant tries to manipulate the proceedings by switching between requests for counsel and for self-people v. lewis and oliver motion for self-conduct to decide whether he or she truly wishes to give up the right to counsel and people v. marshall, 7 supra, at pp. 25-26; people v. tena, supra, have concluded that under some circumstances, remarks facially resembling requests for self-(people v. tena, supra, at p. 607.) people v. scott (2001) 91 cal.app.4th 1197 and people v. tena, supra, 156 cal.app.4th 598, are instructive. in scott, the defendant made a marsden motion people v. scott, supra, at pp. 1204-1205 & fn. 3.) when the trial court queried whether the defendant was sure he wished to represent himself, the id. at p. 1205.) he further stated that if he could not obtain a new appointed attorney, he would represent himself. he reiterated that he did not want his currently appointed attorney representing him. (id. at p. 1205.) scott concluded that these remarks, viewed in context, were too equivocal to constitute a faretta request, and were made out of frustration at the denial of the marsden motion. (id. at p. 1205.) in people v. tena, supra, 156 cal.app.4th 598, the defendant complained that his court-appointed attorney had failed to subpoena witnesses for the preliminary hearing, id. at p. 605.) the court denied his request without further explanation. approximately one month later the trial court conducted a marsden hearing, during which the defendant shire a private attorney to represent him. (id. at pp. 605-606.) when the trial court denied the marsden motion and indicated the defendant could hire a private attorney only after the preliminary hearing transpired, the defendant became agitated. the defendant then requested self-representation, a request the court denied. (id. at p. 606.) the defendant did not renew his request to proceed in propria persona thereafter. (ibid.) tena concluded -representation requests were equivocal. (id. at pp. 607-609.) the defendant did not make a self-representation request at his next court appearance. (id. at p. 609; see also people v. marshall, supra, 15 cal.4th at pp. 15-19, 25, 27 [faretta request was not sincere where the defendant represented himself during 8 certain pretrial proceedings, then requested and received a court-appointed attorney, and subsequently sought self-representation; request was an emotional response to his atpeople v. danks (2004) 32 cal.4th 269, 295- desire to avoid further psychiatric analysis].) marsden motions. (see people v. tena, supra, 156 cal.app.4th at p. 609 [where faretta requests were made only after denial of marsden motions, and private counsel, denial was proper].) his comments to the court readily revealed that his real goal was not self-representation, but appointment of a different attorney. his request, in both instances, was an emotional response made out of frustration at the denial of his marsden requests. (see people v. tena, supra, conduct the defense as he wished]; people v. scott, supra, 91 cal.app.4th at p. 1206; people v. valdez (2004) 32 cal.4th 73, 98-99.) gomez also indicated to the court at the september 21, 2009 hearing that he intended to hire private counsel, further suggesting his desire was not genuinely for self-representation but for a different attorney. his repeated switching between requests for self-representation and a new attorney indicates, on the facts here, that the faretta requests were equivocal. (see people v. lewis and oliver, supra, 39 cal.4th at p. 1002.) we recognize, of course, that the mere fact a defendant requests self-representation after a marsden denial does not demonstrate the request is necessarily equivocal. (see people v. michaels (2002) 28 cal.4th 486, 524 nothing equivocal in a request that counsel be removed and, if not removed, that the defendgenuine, unequivocal expressions of a desire for self-representation. 9 faretta concluded, as a factual represent himself, but was merely an impulsive comment made due to his anger and marsden motion. as noted, a court should draw every inference against waiver of the right to counsel, and a motion made out of passing anger or frustration is properly denied. (people v. stanley, supra, 39 cal.4th at p. 932; people v. marshall, supra, 15 cal.4th at pp. 22-23.) b. -representation request was untimely and properly denied; any error was harmless. faretta request was untimely. there is no bright line when a motion may be denied as untimely. nor has [the california supreme court] fixed any definitive time before trial at which a motion for self-representation is considered untimely, or articulated factors a trial court may consider in determining whether a self-representpeople v. lynch, supra, 50 cal.4th at p. 722.) it has repeatedly been held that faretta motions made on the eve of trial are untimely. (people v lynch, supra, at pp. 722-723, and authorities cited therein.) conversely, motions made months before trial have been considered timely. (id. extend beyond a mere counting of the days between the motion and the scheduled trial ibidtimeliness for purposes of faretta is based not on a fixed and arbitrary point in time, but upon consideration of the totality of the circumstances that exist in the case at the time the self-representation motion is made. an analysis based on these considerations is in accord with the purpose of the timeliness requirement, which is people v. lynch, supra, at p. 724.) 10 faretta the people were ready to proceed; defense counsel indicated he had subpoenaed witnesses. while the question is close, we people v. clark (1992) 3 cal.4th 41, 99-100 [faretta request untimely where the case had been continued day-to-day in the expectation motions would be concluded and jury selection would begin]; people v. burton (1989) 48 cal.3d 843, 852-853 [faretta motion was untimely where it was made after the case had been called for trial, counsel had answered ready, and case had been transferred for pretrial motions and jury selection].) a defendant has the burden of justifying an untimely motion, which is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court. (people v. marshall (1996) 13 cal.4th 799, 827; people v. horton (1995) 11 cal.4th 1068, 1110; people v. lynch, supra, 50 cal.4th at p. 722; people v. windham, supra, 19 cal.3d at pp. 127-128.) in assessing an untimely self-representation motion, the trial court considers such factors as the quality of reasons for the request, the length and stage of the proceedings, and the disruption or delay which might reasonably be expected to follow the granting of the motion. (people v. lynch, supra, at p. 722, fn. 10; people v. windham, supra, at p. 128.) here the windham factors, although not expressly discussed by the trial court, favored denial of the motion. (see people v. windham, supra, at p. 129, fn. 6 [there is no requirement that a trial court must, in all cases, state the reasons underlying its denial of a self-representation motion]; people v. bradford (2010) 187 cal.app.4th 1345, 1354-1355; people v. scott, supra, 91 cal.app.4th at p. 1206 [although trial court may not have explicitly considered each of the windham factors, the record was sufficient to show an implicit consideration of the relevant factors]; people v. perez (1992) 4 cal.app.4th 893, 904.) 11 gomez clearly had a proclivity to attempt to substitute counsel, as demonstrated by his repeated marsden motions. (see people v. scott, supra, 91 cal.app.4th at p. 1206.) his complaints were either petty or involved trial tactics, an insufficient basis upon which to grant an untimely faretta request. (ibid.the five marsden motions indicated defense counsel was adequately representing gomez. further, the second faretta motion was made during the period immediately preceding trial. although gomez did not move for a continuance, the trial was expected to involve expert testimony, medical evidence, and dna evidence, among other things. had the case proceeded to trial, it seems inevitable that gomez would have required more time to prepare, resulting in a delay of trial. if gomez intended to accept the plea offer, the reasons for his faretta request were not compelling. gomez offered no reason for his request except that he did not agree with his attorney. he indicated he intended to accept nsel. under these circumstances, we cannot say the denial of the second faretta request was an abuse of discretion. additionally, the denial of an untimely faretta request is not automatically reversible, but is reviewed for harmless error under the watson standard. (people v. rivers (1993) 20 cal.app.4th 1040, 1050; people v. watson (1956) 46 cal.2d 818, 836.) ile represented by counselthe same action he stated he wished to take if representing himselfthe record reveals no faretta request. 12 disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports aldrich, j. we concur: croskey, acting p. j. kitching, j.
