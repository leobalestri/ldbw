(a)-(d)), and two prior convictions for which he served prison terms ( 667.5). at trial, the prosecution presented evidence that on department deputy sheriffs enterein order to execute a search warrant. appellant was seated on a couch in the living room. after the deputy sheriffs found a 1 all further statutory citations are to the penal code. 2 the offense of being a felon in possession of a firearm is now codified in section 29800, subdivision (a)(1). 3 loaded handgun under a cushion on the couch, appellant stated that the gun belonged to him.3 on july 11,1997, a jury found appellant guilty of being a felon in possession of a firearm. after finding true the allegations that appellant had suffered convictions for first degree burglary and involuntary manslaughter in 1993, the trial court sentenced him to a term of 25 years to life under the three strikes law. in an unpublished opinion, this court affirmed the judgment.

(people v. yearwood (2013) 213 cal.app.4th 161, 169-171.) the reform act amended the three strikes law to provide that absent specified exceptions, an offender with two or more prior strikes is to be sentenced as a two strike offender unless the new offense also is a strike, that is, a serious or violent felony.4 (see 3 at trial, a-brother testified that he owned the gun. appellant denied that the gun belonged to him, testifying that he had claimed otherwise in order to prevent others from going to jail. 4 strikeviolent felonyubdivision (c), or a serious felony (people v. blackburn (1999) 72 cal.app.4th 1520, 1525.) 4 ibid.) the reform act also added section 1170.126, which creates a post-conviction resentencing proceeding for specified inmates sentenced under the prior version of the three strikes law. (people v. yearwood, supra, at pp. 169-171.) under that statute, a defendant sentenced as a three strike offender may petition for recall of the sentence and for resentencing, but is subject to certain eligibility criteria.

(people v. johnson (2015) 61 cal.4th 674, 691.) in february 2013, appellant filed a petition for resentencing pursuant to section 1170.126. on august 23, 2016, the trial court denied the petition with prejudice, concluding that appellant was ineligible for resentencing because he was armed with a firearm during the commission of the offense of being a felon in possession of a firearm ( 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(c), 1170.126, subd. (e)(2)). this appeal followed. discussion appellant contends the trial court erred in finding him ineligible for resentencing under an exclusion that applies if commission of the current offense, [that is, the offense which the resentencing petition targets] the defendant . . . was armed with a firearm or deadly weapon . . . .

[citation.] the fundamental purpose of statutory construction is to ascertain the intent of the lawmakers so as to effectuate the purpose of the law. [citation.] in determining intent, we look first to the words themselves. [citations.] when the language is clear and unambiguous, there is no need for construction. [citations.] when the language is susceptible of more than one reasonable interpretation, however, we look to a variety of extrinsic aids, including the ostensible objects to be achieved, the evils to be remedied, the legislative history, public policy, contemporaneous administrative construction, and the statutory scheme of which the statute is a part. [citation.] we also analyses and arguments contained in the official ballot [c(people v. superior court (cervantes) (2014) 225 cal.app.4th 1007, 1014 (cervantes).) 6 the key issue before us concerns the circumstances under which the offense of being a felon in possession of a firearm is subject to the eligibility exclusion relating to armederpreting the term armedpeople v. bland (1995) 10 cal.4th 991 (bland), which examined a sentencing enhancement set forth in section 12022, armed with a firearm in the commission or attempted commission of a felony.(bland, supra, at p. 998.) our supreme court encompasses unloaded and inoperable firearms, as such id. at pp. 1004-1005, quoting people v. nelums (1982) 31 cal.3d 355, 360.) the court further concluded that the enhancement also demands the satisfaction of certain requirements beyond the mere penalty applies only if the defendant is armed with a firearm . . . during facilitative nexusbland, supra, 10 cal.4th at p. 1002.) in construing the eligibility exclusion relating to the elements of this offense are 7 conviction of a felony and ownership or knowing possession, custody, or control of a firearm. [citations]. a defendant possesses a weapon when it is under his dominion and control. [citation.] a defendant has actual possession when the weapon is in his immediate possession or control. he has constructive possession when the weapon, while not in his actual possession, is nonetheless under his dominion and control, either directly or through others. the (people v. osuna (2014) 225 cal.app.4th 1020, 1029-1030 (osuna).) as explained in osuna, because one defendant may commit the offense of being a felon in possession of a firearm without having satisfied the bland. (id. at p. 1030.) numerous courts have determined that under the reform act, the offense of being a felon in possession of a firearm falls under the pertinent eligibility exclusion when the possession in question amounted to arming, as specified in bland. (e.g., people v. white (2014) 223 cal.app.4th 512, 524-525; cervantes, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at pp. 1012-1018; osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at pp. 1028-1038; people v. blakely (2014) 225 cal.app.4th 1042, 1051-1057; people v. elder (2014) 227 cal.app.4th 1308, 1312-1314 & fn. 7 (elder); people v. brimmer (2014) 230 cal.app.4th 782, 793-799; people v. hicks (2014) 231 cal.app.4th 275, 283-284 (hicks).) instructive discussions of the exclusion are 8 found in osuna, elder, and hicks. in osuna, the defendant drove his car at an excessive speed and refused to yield to a police officer who tried to pull him over. (osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1027.) the defendant eventually stopped, left his car while holding a gun, and fled into a house. (ibid.) after arresting the defendant, officers found an unloaded nine-millimeter gun hidden in the house and nine-millimeter ammunition in the car. (ibid.) the defendant was convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm and obstructing a police officer, and was sentenced as a three strike offender. (id. at pp. 1026-127.) when the defendant sought resentencing, the trial court determined that he was ineligible for relief because he was armed with a firearm during the commission of his firearm. (osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1028.) in affirming that ruling, the appellate court concluded that the offense did not, by itself, render the defendant ineligible absent a showing that he was armed, as defined in bland, viz., that the firearm was available to him for offensive or defensive use. (id. at p. 1030.) the court recognized that commission of the crime of possession of a firearm by a (id. at p. 1032.) the court determined that the exclusion demands only a temporal nexus -- but no facilitative nexus -- 9 between the arming and the offense of being a felon in possession of a firearm, as the exclusion merely requires that unlike the enhancement construed in bland, which requires (id. at pp. 1032-1033.) in elder, police officers executing a search warrant for an apartment found the defendant standing outside the apartment. (elder, supra, 227 cal.app.4th at p. 1317.) the defendant admitted that he lived there. (ibid.) inside the apartment, the officers discovered two guns and a photo of the defendant holding one of them. (ibid.) after being convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm, he was sentenced as a three strike offender. (id. at p. 1311.) following the denial of his petition for resentencing, he . . require[s] something beyond the substantive offenon decisions interpreting the enhancement discussed in bland. (id. at p. 1312.) in affirming the denial of the petition, the appellate court rejected that contention, stating: reasoning rests on its conflating the criterial definition of an ineligible offense (being armed during the commission of such offense) with the derivative nature of the armed enhancement (which requires being armed in id. at pp. 1312-1313.) in hicks, police officers frisked the defendant after he 10 appeared to throw away a bag containing drugs, and found he had several .380 caliber bullets. (hicks, supra, 231 cal.app.4th at pp. 280-281.) when the officers searched a nearby apartment, they found a backpack containing a loaded .380 caliber gun. (ibid.) a witness told the officers that the defendant had carried the backpack into the apartment. (ibid.) the defendant was convicted of possession of a firearm as a felon and sentenced as a three strike offender on the basis of that offense. (ibid.) later, the concluding that he was armed with a firearm when he committed the offense of possessing a firearm as a felon. (id. at pp. 279-280, 284.) the appellate court affirmed that ruling, applying an interpretation of the exclusion identical to that set forth in osuna. (id. at pp. 283-284.) in contention that it requi (id at p. 283.) the court explained that although the contention would be correct if directed at the arming enhancement discussed in bland, it failed in light of the plain language of the exclusion, which concerns eligibility for reduced punishment. (ibid.) as the court noted, the exclusion requires no facilitative nexus between the arming and any offense. (ibid.) here, the record establishes that appellant was armed with a firearm -- that is, had a gun available to him for offensive or defensive use -- during his possession of the 11 firearm as a felon.6 the evidence submitted in connection appellant admitted possession of the gun found under the cushion on the couch upon which he had been sitting. (see cervantes, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at pp. 1011-1018 firearm rendered him ineligible for resentencing under the reform act when the evidence showed that at the time of appellant contends the pertinent exclusion, viewed in the context of the reform act, must be interpreted to require a facilitative nexus between arming and an offense independent of the crime of being a felon in possession of a 6 as the resentencing provisions of section 1170.126 do not require that the eligibility facts have been resolved by the verdicts or special findings rendered at trial, many decisions have concluded that the trial court may independently examine the record of conviction in order to make determinations regarding those facts. (e.g., white, supra, 223 cal.app.4th at pp. 526-527; osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1020; people v. manning (2014) 226 cal.app.4th 1133, 1139-1144; elder, supra, 227 cal.app.4th at pp. 1314-1336; bradford, supra, 227 cal.app.4th at pp. 1338-1340; brimmer, supra, 230 cal.app.4th at pp. 799-801; hicks, supra, 231 cal.app.4th at p. 275.) this court reached the same conclusion in a recent decision (people v. frierson (2016) 1 cal.app.5th 788, 791-793, rev. granted oct. 19, 2016, s236728). 12 firearm. under the reform act, subdivision (e)(2) of section 1170.126 provides that a defendant is not eligible for resentencing if his or her current sentence was imposed for an offense appearing in three provisions stated in materially identical terms in both sections 667 and 1170.12 ( 667, subd. (e)(2)(c)(i)-(iii), 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(c)(i)-(iii)). of those three provisions, two enumerate particular offenses rendering a defendant ineligible for resentencing. ( 667, subd. (e)(2)(c)(i)-(ii), 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(c)(i)-(ii).) the remaining provision, which incorporates the exclusion at issue here, states that the defendant is ineligible the commission of the current offense, the defendant used a firearm, was armed with a firearm or deadly weapon, or ( 667, subd. (e)(2)(c)(iii), 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(c)(iii).) appellant maintains that the structure of the three provisions establishes that the pertinent exclusion applies only when the arming is related to, or promotes, an offense other than being a felon in possession of a firearm. he meant to exclude specific offenses entirely, it so states, but where it is meant to exclude an offense only if something beyond its mere the he current offense as an addition and not just be an element of [d]uring the commission of the current offense 13 another disagree. although the third provision specifies circumstances rendering the current offense ineligible for resentencing, nothing in it suggests that those circumstances must attach to a crime other than the current offense. as noted in bradfordwhich the defendant seeks resentencing. (bradford, supra, 227 cal.app.4th at p. 1332.) the provision thus encompasses the offense of being a felon in possession of a firearm when the manner in which that crime was committed involved arming. appellant also contends eligibility exclusion must be construed as having the same mconstrued in bland. to support that contention, appellant to express a purely temporal relationship. he directs our attention to people v. poroj (2010) 190 cal.app.4th 165, 176 and people v. valdez (2010) 189 cal.app.4th 82, 90, which examined an enhancement in section 12022.7, subdivision (a), applicable to defendants who personally inflict great ttempted criminal conduct and the injury. (poroj, supra, at pp. 172-176; valdez, supra, at p. 90.) 14 s nothing within the bland a purely temporal meaning. (merriam-a purely temporal meaning does not show that the word the eligibility exclusion, expresses a facilitative relationship in addition to a temporal one. appellant also contends that so construing the eligibility exclusion would frustrate the goals of proposition 36. he asserts that in approving proposition 36, the electorate did not intend to deny relief to offenders convicted of possessing a firearm as a felon, which he characterizes as - proposition 36 was meant to give lesser sentences to the less dangerous felons while making sure that the truly dangerous felons were kept behind bars. . . . [] having a weapon readily available for use generally does not render a person truly dangerous; it is a right protected by the federal constitution. it only becomes dangerous when it might facilitate a crime, when it might be election materials relating to proposition 36, which state that it was not intended to afford relief to offenders who committed gun-related feloniesinvolved 15 firearm possession.cervantes, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1016, italics omitted.) as explained in elder, although possession of a gun of itself is not criminal, a possession of a gun is not a crime that is merely malum prohibitum. . . . momentary possession of guns by convicted felons who, the [citation.] therefore, even if the great majority of commitments for unlawful gun possession come within our interpretation of this eligibility criterion, it would not run elder, supra, 227 cal.app.4th at p. 1314, quoting people v. pepper (1996) 41 cal.app.4th 1029, 1037-1038.) in sum, the trial court did not err in resentencing.7 7 in a related contention, appellant suggests that the sion undercuts the interpretation placed on the exclusion by osuna and the other pertinent decisions. he argues that those decisions excluding anyone who had access to a weapon instead of making such an exclusion clear by including the weapons possession crime in the list of crimes for which resentencing for the reasons discussed above, we reject that argument. because proposition 36 reflects an intent to deny relief for offenders convicted of -related felonies,the (fn. continued on next page.) 16 disposition the order of the trial court is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports manella, j. we concur: epstein, p. j. willhite, j. that characterizes - in temporal terms, that is, by means of the
