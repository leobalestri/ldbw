(a)). the same minute order indicated that prior to the plea, the court warned defendant: you are not a citizen, you are hereby advised that a conviction of the offense for which you have been charged may have the consequences of deportation, exclusion from admission to the united states, or denial of naturalization pursuant to the laws of the united states suspended his sentence and placed him on probation. currently is available. in april 2016, defendant moved to withdraw his guilty plea pursuant to section 1016.5. in his declaration in support of the motion, defendant attorney advised me that by pleading guilty, i would or could be removed from the country and/or lose my ability to fight for my legal residence defendant further averred that he now faces removal from this country and has exhausted his federal challenges to such removal. finally, defendant stated that he 3 would not have pled guilty if he had known of the potential immigration consequences of his conviction. he would have the trial court denied defendantplea, and this appeal followed.1 discussion section 1016.5, subdivision (a) provides: any offense punishable as a crime under state law, except offenses designated as infractions under state law, the court shall administer the following advisement on the record to the defendant: if you are not a citizen, you are hereby advised that conviction of the offense for which you have been charged may have the consequences of deportation, exclusion from admission to the united states, or denial of naturalization pursuant to the section 1016.5, subdivision (b) specif[a]bsent a record that the court provided the advisement required by this section, the defendant shall be presumed not to have received the required tion 1016.5 addresses only the duty of trial courts to advise the defendant of the immigration consequences of the plea, and it empowers the court to vacate a conviction and set aside a plea only for the failure to fulfill people v. aguilar (2014) 227 cal.app.4th 60, 71.) to obtain relief under section 1016.5, a defendant must immigration consequences as provided by section 1016.5, (2) as a 1 the order denying defeis appealable. (people v. totari (2002) 28 cal.4th 876, 887.) 4 consequence of conviction, the defendant actually faces one or more of the statutorily specified immigration consequences, and (people v. aguilar, supra, 227 cal.app.4th at p. 71.) need not be in the statutory language, and substantial compliance is all that is long as the defendant is specifically advised of all three separate immigration people v. castro-vasquez (2007) 148 cal.app.4th 1240, 1244.) motion to vacate the judgment of conviction for abuse of discretion. (people v. chien (2008) 159 cal.app.4th 1283, 1287.) there was no abuse of discretion. the 1998 minute order reflected that defendant was fully advised of the potential immigration consequences of his plea as required by section 1016.5. the advisement recorded in the minute order specifically tracks the language of section 1016.5advisement is a part of the record. (people v. dubon (2001) 90 cal.app.4th 944, 954.) because there was a record that defendant was advised, the presumption in section 1016.5, subdivision (b) that he was not advised of the immigration consequences of his plea is inapplicable. reliance on the presumption that absent a record of the advisements he is presumed not to have received them is misplaced. (see  1016.5, subd. (b) [absent a record that the court provided the advisement required by this section, the defendant shall be presumed not to have received the required people v. dubon, supra, 90 cal.app.4th at 5 p. 948.) as explained, there was a recordorder. second, people v. dubon, supra, 90 cal.app.4th at pages 955 to 956 does not stand for the proposition that a minute order, standing alone, is insufficient. in dubon, the minute order failed to show that the defendant advisement in full, id. at p. 955.) in contrast here, the 1998 minute order indicated that defendant had been accurately advised in full. therefore, here nothing more was required. the trial court properly relied on the 1998 minute order, (people v. gutierrez (2003) 106 cal.app.4th 169, 176.) dispositon the order is affirmed. flier, j. we concur: bigelow, p. j. rubin, j.
