(a)(17))1 with the personal use of a firearm ( 12022.5, subd. (a)); 16 prior convictions within the meaning of the three strikes law; one prior conviction within the meaning of section 667, subdivision (a); and one prior prison term within the meaning of section 667.5, subdivision (b). another preliminary hearing was conducted on december 13, 1999.2 holmes testified at the 1999 preliminary hearing that he could not remember the incident, but repeatedly 1 unless otherwise noted, further statutory references are to the penal code. 2 the record before us on this appeal shows that the case was dismissed because the people were unable to find holmes. the case was refiled in 1999. 3 admitted as truthful his prior identification to investigators of appellant as the shooter and his prior testimony at the first preliminary hearing. when defense counsel objected to the magistrate inability to remember the shooting was feigned. before trial, the people offered appellant three possible dispositions: (1) plead guilty to second degree murder and be sentenced to 15 years to life in state prison; (2) waive jury and have a court trial with all enhancements and prior convictions stricken and face a maximum sentence of 25 years to life for first degree murder; or, (3) go to jury trial and face life without the possibility of parole plus numerous additional years. at first, appellant chose to proceed by jury, but subsequently agreed to a court trial. at the court trial, the prosecution established the facts preliminary hearing testimony. when defense counsel objected, the trial court noted the 1994 preliminary hearing testimony was admissible under the prior inconsistent statement exception to the hearsay rule pursuant to evidence code section 1235. in 2000, the trial court found appellant guilty of first degree murder and imposed a sentence of 25 years to life. appellant timely appealed. in that earlier appeal, no. b145295, appointed counsel filed a wende brief, and appellant filed a supplemental brief. among other issues raised, appellant testimony should not have been admitted at trial. we rejected that contention, explaining thatestimony was admissible as a prior inconsistent statement based 4 memory was contrived. (people v. green (1971) 3 cal.3d 981, 988-989.) we affirmed the judgment in our opinion filed on may 31, 2001. (people v. williams (may 31, 2001, b145295) [nonpub. opn.].) more than a decade passed. on april 7, 2017, appellant filed a motion sentence,seeking to vacate his murder conviction. he contended, as he had in his supplemental brief in his earlier preliminary hearing testimony. on april 25, 2017, the court denied the motion on procedural grounds that appellant had failed to explain and justify the significant delay in seeking relief and had raised issues which were raised and rejected on appeal.3 appellant timely appealed. ( 1237, subd. (b).) discussion -appointed appellate counsel filed an opening brief, asking this court to review the record independently pursuant to wende, supra, 25 cal.3d 436. in his supplemental brief, appellant contends, as he did in his first appeal, case no. at the 1994 preliminary hearing should not have been admitted at trial. we addressed this issue in appeal no. b145295 and concluded that, as a matter of law, that contention had no merit. because our legal conclusion established law of the case (people v. 3 the court incorrectly stated that the conviction resulted from a plea. it did not. 5 boyer (2006) 38 cal.4th 412, 442), we do not address that same contention again. appellant further contends that the court erred in denying his 2017 motion for his failure to justify the significant delay, because appellant raised an issue of constitutional dimension he did not. instead, he raised an issue that we already decided and that as already noted constitutes law of the case. we have examined the entire record and are satisfied that no arguable issues exist, and that appellant has, by virtue of wende procedure and our review of the record, received adequate and effective appellate review of the judgment entered against him in this case.
