however, zero billable units of water were consumed at the nordhoff home in 2008 and during several periods in 2009. wohler also compared the relative amounts of electricity consumed at the nordhoff and sheldon homes between the fall of 2006 and the end of the summer of 2007. during that time period, average daily electricity consumption at the nordhoff home was 30 percent greater than that consumed at the sheldon home. porfirio salazar, a dwp meter reader, testified that he went to the nordhoff house every other month for the past 15 years. according to salazar, an aggressive dog was 6 present at the nordhoff home before may of 2007, but the dog was absent from may 2007 until 2011. salazar stated that the home appeared to be vacant in 2007, but that at some point the home was being renovated, landscaped, and painted, as if people were about to move in. nancy hodges-jimenez, who worked in various staff positions for alarcon from 1989 to 2013, testified that she went to the nordhoff home occasionally in 2007 to deliver work or mail for alarcon. brother, miguel angel montes de oca, testified that from september 2007 through april 2009 he renovated the nordhoff home. he installed new wood floors and bathroom tile, patched and painted the walls throughout the home, and installed new kitchen and bathroom lighting and plumbing fixtures. the renovation work was done to prepare the home so that defendants could move there. that he repaired and refinished a porcelain bathtub at the nordhoff home on november 5 or 6 of 2007. to perform the work, rodriguez had to enter the home, which was on october 28, 2009, the los angeles police department responded to a burglary call at the nordhoff home. alarcon met the responding officer and authorized a forced entry into the home, where officers arrested lawrence payton. payton had changed the locks to all of the doors in the home, and told the officers remnants of books and clothes were among the ashes in the fireplace, and payton memorabilia. officers again arrested payton inside the nordhoff home on march 11, 2010. jury instructions at the conclusion of the evidence, the trial court instructed the jury on the elements of the crime of fraudulent voting. that instruction stated in relevant part as follows: 7 in order to prove this crime each of the following elements must be proved: 1. the defendant voted in an election; 2. at the time that the defendant voted, he was not entitled to vote in that election; 3. at the time that the defendant voted in the election he knew that he was not entitled to vote in that election; 4. the defendant had the specific intent to defraud. the trial court instructed the jury that to be entitled to vote in an election, a person must have completed and signed under penalty of perjury a voter registration form stating name and place of residence. the court advised the voting purposes means domicile, and that which his or her habitation is fixed, wherein the person has the intention of remaining, and to which, whenever he is absent, the person has the intentany given time, a person may the trial court further instructed residence of a person is that place in which the fixed for some period of time, but wherein he or she does not have the intention of [a]t a given time, a person may the trial court gave the jury the following special instruction, no. ec 2026, with regard to the domicile of a member of the legislature: the domicile of a member of the state legislature shall be conclusively presumed to be at the residence address indicated on that section 2026. this section means that a member of the legislature is conclusively presumed to have the intent to remain in or return to the residence which they list on their sworn statement of voter registration. thus, california election code 2026 permits incumbent legislators to elect their domicile by filing a sworn voter registration form. 8 the defendant was not a member of the legislature for any elections that occurred in the year 2008. the trial court also gave the jury special instruction no. ec 2032, regarding multiple residences. that instruction quoted verbatim the language of elections code section 2032: except as otherwise provided in this article, if a person has more than one residence and that person has not physically resided at any one of the residences within the preceding year, there shall be a rebuttable presumption that those residences in which he or she has not so resided within the immediate preceding year are merely residences as defined in subdivision (c) of section 359 and not his or her domicile. the court instructed the jury on presumptions as follows: a presumption is an assumption of facts that the law requires to be made from another fact or group of facts found or otherwise established in the actions. a presumption is not evidence. a presumption is either conclusive or rebuttable. a conclusive presumption is one which proof of certain acts makes the existence of the assumed fact beyond dispute. the presumption cannot be rebutted or contradicted by the evidence to the contrary. a rebuttable presumption is one that can be disproved by evidence to the contrary. jury verdicts the jury found alarcon guilty of one count of perjury by declaration on november 6, 2008 (count 17) and three counts of fraudulent voting on november 5, 2008, march 3, 2009, and may 19, 2009 (counts 14, 19, and 21) and not guilty of the remaining charges. the jury found mrs. alarcon guilty of one count of perjury by declaration on november 4, 2008 (count 15), and two counts of fraudulent voting on march 3, 2009 and may 19, 2009 (counts 20 and 22) and acquitted her of the remaining charges. 9 discussion jury pursuant to no. ec 2032 that there was a mandatory presumption that defendants were not legally domiciled in any residence in which they had not physically resided during the preceding year. they argue that that instruction deprived them of their due process rights because it relieved the prosecution of its burden of proving all of the elements of the crimes beyond a reasonable doubt. i. standard of review must instruct on the general principles of law relevant to the issues raised by the evidence. [citations.] the general principles of law governing the case are those principles closely and openly connected with the facts before the court, and which are necessary for the jurys understanding of the case. (people v. smith (2013) 57 cal.4th 232, 239.) [citation.] (people v. cooksey (2002) 95 cal.app.4th 1407, 1411; see people v. waidla (2000) 22 cal.4th 690, 737.) when reviewing the effect of challenged instructions, we with other instructions, in order to determine if there was a reasonable likelihood the jury applied the challenged instructio (people v. hajek and vo (2014) 58 cal.4th 1144, 1217.) instructional errors that raise an improper presumption on an element of an offense are subject to a harmless error standard of review, that is, whether the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. (carella v. california (1989) 491 u.s. 263, 266-267, overruled on another ground in hedgpeth v. pulido (2008) 555 u.s. 57; people v. flood (1998) 18 cal.4th 470, 499.) ii. mandatory and permissible rebuttable presumptions it is often necessary for the trier of fact to determine the existence of an element of the crime -- that is, an ulti or elemental fact -- from the existence of one or more 10 evidentiary or basic facts. [citations.] the value of these evidentiary devices, and their validity under the due process clause, vary from case to case, however, depending on the strength of the connection between the particular basic and elemental facts involved and on the degree to which the device curtails the factfinders freedom to assess the evidence independently. nonetheless, in criminal cases, the ultimate test of any s constitutional validity in a given case remains constant: the device must not undermine the factfinders responsibility at trial, based on evidence adduced by the state, to find the ultimate facts beyond a reasonable doubt. [citations.]ulster county court v. allen (1979) 442 u.s. 140, 156 (ulster county).) in determining whether a particular presumption passes constitutional muster, the united states supreme court in ulster county permissive inference or presumption, which allows -- but does not require -- the trier of fact to infer the elemental fact from proof by the prosecutor of the basic one and which ulster county, supra, 442 u.s. at p. . . . [that] tells the trier of fact that he or they must find the elemental fact upon proof of the basic fact, at least unless the defendant has come forward with some evidence to rebut the presumed connection between the two facts. [citation.]ibid.) because a permissive presumption credit or reject the inference, it does not shift the burden of proof, and affects application of the reasonable doubt standard only if, under the facts of the case, there is no rational way the trier could make the connection permitted by the inference. (ibid.) a mandatory presumption, the court in ulster county concluded, is because it requires the jury to assume an ultimate elemental fact upon proof of a designated basic fact, burden(ulster county, supra, 442 u.s. at p. 157.) for that reason, the court concluded that the validity of a mandatory presumption must be detid. at pp. 157-158.) guilt, it may not rest its case on a [mandatory rebuttable] presumption unless the fact 11 proved is suffid. at p. 167.) in ulster county, the u.s. supreme court found that the jury instructions given -- e-- gave rise only to a permissive inference, and not a mandatory presumption. the supreme court esumption only in certain circumstances, rather than a mandatory conclusion of possession, and that it could be ignored by the jury even if there 3 (ulster county, supra, 442 u.s. at pp. 161-162, fn. omitted.) the principles set forth in ulster county were applied by the california supreme court in people v. roder (1983) 33 cal.3d 491 in construing the mandatory rebuttable presumption contained in penal code section 496. pursuant to that statute, the trial court in roder instructed the jury that if they found that the defendant was a dealer in secondhand merchandise who bought or received stolen property under circumstances that should have caused the defendant right to sell that merchandise, they should presume the defendant did so knowing the merchandise was stolen, unless, based on all the evidence, there was a reasonable doubt that the defendant knew the property was stolen. (id. at pp. 495-496.) the california mandatory rebuttable presumption because it informed must find the elemental fact upon proof of the basic fact, at least unless the defendant has come 3 the trial court in ulster county instructed the jury that the presumption regarding ive only so long as there is no substantial evidence contradicting the conclusion flowing from the presumption, and the ulster county, supra, 442 u.s. at p. 162, fn. 19.) the trial court further weapons in this case need not be rebutted by affirmative proof or affirmative evidence but may be rebutted by any evidence or lacibid.) 12 [citation.]id. at p. 501, quoting ulster county, supra, 442 u.s. at p. 157.) iii. no. ec 2032 is a mandatory rebuttable presumption the jury instruction at issue here, no. ec 2032, is a mandatory rebuttable person has not physically resided at any one of the residences within the preceding year, there shall be a rebuttable presumption that those residences in which he or she has not so resided within the immediate preceding year are merely residences . . . and not his or her the instruction informs the jurors that upon proof of the basic fact -- the defendant has not physically resided in a residence within the preceding year -- they must evidence to the contrary. unlike the jury instructions given in ulster county, the instructions given by the trial court in the instant case did not inform the jurors that the presumption in no. ec 2032 gave rise to a permissive inference rather than a mandatory conclusion regarding defendy advise the jury that they were free to disregard the presumption even if defendants presented no affirmative evidence in rebuttal. no. ec 2032 accordingly was an impermissible mandatory presumption. the people argue that instruction no. ec 2032 -- read together with the other instructions, specifically, special instruction no. ec 18560 -- did not amount to a mandatory rebuttable presumption. no. ec 18560 required the jury to find the following facts before finding defendants guilty of fraudulent voting: (1) defendants were not entitled to vote at the election, (2) defendants to vote, and (3) defendants . knowledge and specific intent, the people argue, are the key elements of fraudulent voting, and entitlement to vote is the jury could not convict defendants of fraudulent voting solely upon finding that defendants did not live at the nordhoff home for a year; they would have to find that the prosecution proved the additional elements of knowledge and intent to defraud beyond a reasonable doubt. because no. ec 2032 13 elements the presumption regarding domicile was that the jury was required to find the additional elements of guilty knowledge and intent to defraud before convicting defendants of fraudulent voting does not alter the fact that the mandatory presumption of instruction no. ec 2032 shifted the burden of proof regarding an element of the crime. the jury could not convict defendants of fraudulent voting without also finding that defendants were not entitled to vote in the election -- a finding that in turn hinged on the separate finding that the nordhoff home was not the presumption in instruction no. ec 2032 was a mandatory rebuttable presumption that relieved the prosecution of its burden of proving every element of the crime of fraudulent voting beyond a reasonable doubt. giving such an instruction was (ulster county, supra, 442 u.s. at p. 157; roder, supra, 33 cal.3d at p. 501.) iv. the error was not harmless the verdicts rendered indicate that the jury harbored reasonable doubts concerning defendantin 2008. the jury acquitted alarcon of all charges arising in 2006 and 2007, consistent with the conclusive presumption applicable to state legislators as set forth in special instruction no. ec 2026,4 and with evidence that alarcon may have occupied the nordhoff home in 2007. there was abundant evidence that the nordhoff home was vacant and under construction in 2008. in addition, the jurors were instructed that the conclusive presumption applicable to state legislators did not apply to any elections that occurred in 2008. the jurors nevertheless acquitted alarcon of fraudulent voting and perjury charges on february 8, 2008, june 3, 2008, and october 8, 2008, but convicted him of fraudulent 4 the conclusive presumption of instruction no. ec 2026 required the jury to the state assembly until he resigned from that office to take his seat as the district seven representative on the city council following his election in march 2007. 14 voting on november 5, 2008, and perjury by declaration on november 6, 2008. the jury similarly acquitted mrs. alarcon of perjury by declaration on april 7, 2008, but found her guilty of the same charge on november 4, 2008.5 the jury thus determined that defendants were entitled to claim the nordhoff home as their domicile as of october 8, 2008, but were not entitled to do so less than one month later, on november 4, 2008. the jury-specific dis consistent with the mandatory presumption in special instruction no. ec 2032. that instruction required the jury to determine whether defendants had physically resided at the nordhoff home within the preceding year. once the jurors found that defendants had not done so, the mandatory presumption of no. ec 2032 required them to find that that the distinction drawn by the jury between the october 2008 and the november 2008 charges nordhoff home within the preceding year. there was evidence that renovation of the nordhoff home began in the fall of 2007. there was also specific evidence that the nordhoff home was vacant on november 5, 2007, when a worker entered the home to refinish a bathtub. conviction for perjury on november 4, 2008, and fraudulent voting on november 5, 2008, are one year to the date after that work occurred, a strong indication that the mandatory presumption of instruction no. given these circumstances, we cannot conclude that the instructional error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. 5 as discussed, the jury also convicted the alarcons of fraudulent voting on march 3, and may 19, 2009, but acquitted them both of perjury by declaration on june 18, 2009. 15 disposition the judgment is reversed and the matter is remanded to the superior court for further proceedings. not to be published in the official reports. ____________________________, j. chavez we concur: __________________________, acting p. j. ashmann-gerst __________________________, j. hoffstadt
