(b)-(i); 1170.12). the court sentenced madrigal to a prison term of 25 years to life.2 1 undesignated statutory references are to the penal code. 2 we affirmed the conviction in people v. madrigal (jan. 10, 2001, b140308) [nonpub. opn.]. 3 on march 29, 2013 madrigal filed a petition for recall of his sentence and resentencing under proposition 36, which amended the three strikes law to provide that a defendant is not subject to an indeterminate life term for a third strike felony that is neither serious nor violent, unless the offense satisfies other criteria identified in the statute.3 the amendments also allow inmates previously sentenced to indeterminate terms under the three strikes law to petition for recall of their sentences and for resentencing to the term that the court would have imposed for their crime had they been sentenced under the new sentencing provisions. ( 1170.126, subd. (a).) madrigal argued in his petition that the court should resentence him to a 10-year determinate term as a second-strike offender because his conviction for possession for sale of cocaine base was not a serious or violent felony or a disqualifying offense under proposition 36 ( 667, subd. (e)(2)(c); 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(c)) and he did not pose an unreasonable risk of danger to 3 prior to proposition 36, the three strikes law provided that a defendant convicted of two prior serious or violent felonies would be subject to an indeterminate life sentence of at least 25 years to life upon conviction of a third felony, even if that felony was not serious or violent.

(e)(1)) and does not meet one of the criteria in section 667, subdivision (e)(2)(c)(i)-(iii) ( 1170.126, subd.
