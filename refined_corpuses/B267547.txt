filed 1/20/16 p. v. hunter ca2/5 not to be published in the official reports california rules of court, rule 8.1115(a), prohibits courts and parties from citing or relying on opinions not certified for publication or ordered published, except as specified by rule 8.1115(b). this opinion has not been certified for publication or ordered published for purposes of rule 8.1115. in the court of appeal of the state of california second appellate district division five the people, plaintiff and respondent, v. john d. hunter, defendant and appellant. b267547 (los angeles county super. ct. no. ba199284) appeal from an order of the superior court of los angeles county, kathleen kennedy-powell, judge. dismissed. john d. hunter, in pro. per., for defendant and appellant. no appearance from plaintiff and respondent. 2 defendant, john d. hunter, purports to appeal from an order denying his habeas corpus petition. we have a duty to raise issues concerning our jurisdiction on our own motion. (jennings v. marralle (1994) 8 cal.4th 121, 126; olson v. cory (1983) 35 cal.3d 390, 398.) as a result, we issued an order to show cause concerning possible the issue. the denial of a habeas corpus petition is not appealable. (in re clark (1993) 5 cal.4th 750, 767, fn. 7; in re hochberg (1970) 2 cal.3d 870, 876, disapproved on other grounds in in re fields (1990) 51 cal.3d 1063, 1070, fn. 3.) thus, we have no jurisdiction to consider the present appeal from an order denying any habeas corpus petition. defendant argues though that we have jurisdiction over the present appeal because he has also appealed from a motion to vacate an illegal sentence. an appeal from a postjudgment order in connection with a legally unauthorized sentence is appealable pursuant to penal code section 1238, subdivision (a)(2). (people v. hamilton (2003) 114 cal.app.4th 932, 938; see people v. karaman (1992) 4 cal.4th 335, 345-346, fn. 11, 349, fn. 15.) we augmented the record to include the pro se motion to strike or vacate a purported illegal sentence filed by defendant on september 2, 2014. it is the denial of this motion that defendant contends vests this court with jurisdiction to decide the merits of his contentions. a legally unauthorized sentence is one which a trial court has no authority to impose. (in re sheena k. (2007) 40 cal.4th 875, 882 & fn. 3, 886-887; people v. scott (1994) 9 cal.4th 331, 354 motion raises no such contention. rather, defendant argues he failed to waive his constitutional rights when entering a guilty plea. merely labeling a motion as one involving an illegal sentence does not vest this court with jurisdiction. the gravamen of the motion was a challenge to the validity 3 of a plea; not to the legality of a sentence. thus, we have no jurisdiction over the present appeal based upon the denial of the motion to vacate a purported illegal sentence. the appeal is dismissed. not to be published in the official reports turner, p. j. we concur: kriegler, j. baker, j.
