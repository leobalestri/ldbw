 filed 9/26/18 p. v. newton ca2/2 not to be published in the official reports california rules of court, rule 8.1115(a), prohibits courts and parties from citing or relying on opinions not certified for publication or ordered published, except as specified by rule 8.1115(b). this opinion has not been certified for publication or ordered published for purposes of rule 8.1115. in the court of appeal of the state of california second appellate district division two the people, plaintiff and respondent, v. benny lee newton, defendant and appellant. b285895 (los angeles county super. ct. no. na041398) appeal from an order of the superior court of los angeles county. william c. ryan, judge. affirmed. jonathan b. steiner, under appointment by the court of appeal, for defendant and appellant. xavier becerra, attorney general, gerald engler, chief assistant attorney general, lance e. winters, assistant attorney general, noah p. hill and allison h. chung, deputy attorneys general, for plaintiff and respondent. 2 defendant and appellant benny lee newton (defendant) resentencing on the ground that he was ineligible for relief under proposition 36 (pen. code,  1170.126).1 defendant contends the trial court erred in finding he was armed during commission of the crime of being a felon in possession of a firearm because there background in 2000, defendant pled guilty to second degree burglary ( 459) (count 1), unlawful taking of a vehicle (veh. code,  10851, subd. (a)) (count 2), evading an officer (veh. code,  2800.2, subd. (a)) (count 3), possession of a firearm by a felon (former  12021, subd. (a)(1)) (count 4), and receiving stolen property ( 496, subd. (a)) (count 5). defendant admitted being armed with a gun during his commission of counts 2 and 3, having a prior burglary conviction when he committed count 4, and that he was released on his own recognizance or on bail when he committed the offenses. the court found that defendant had suffered both a prior juvenile adjudication and a prior conviction within the meaning of the three strikes law ( 667, subds. (b)-(i), 1170.12, subds. (a)-(d)), and had five prior convictions for which he had served prison terms ( 667.5, subd. (b)), and sentenced him to five concurrent terms of 25 years to life, to run consecutively with a sentence imposed in a separate case. this court affirmed the judgmplea. (people v. newton (sept. 17, 2001, b148204) [nonpub. opn.].) in 2014, defendant filed a petition for recall and resentencing pursuant to proposition 36. the prosecution 1 all further statutory references are to the penal code unless stated otherwise. 3 opposed the petition on the grounds that defendant was ineligible for relief on counts 2 through 5 because he was armed with a firearm during commission of those offenses, that the record of conviction supported the finding that he was armed with a firearm and that counts 4 and 5 involved the same course of events as counts 2 and 3. on october 10, 2017, the trial court issued a memorandum of decision finding that there was sufficient evidence in the record to show that defendant was armed with a firearm during commission of the underlying offenses. specifically, the trial court found that on august 20, 2000, defendant pled guilty to counts 1 through 5, including a firearm enhancement under section 12022, subdivision (a)(1) on counts 2 and 3, and that this admission was sufficient to show that defendant was armed with a firearm during the commission of counts 2 and 3. as to counts 4 and 5, the trial court found that the amended information alleged that those offenses occurred on the same date as counts 2 and 3. because all of the crimes occurred on the same date, the trial court inferred that all of the crimes were part of the same with a firearm during counts 2 and 3 applied also to counts 4 and 5. there must be a temporal nexus between the arming and the underlying felony, not a defendant was ineligible for resentencing on counts 2 through 5. this appeal followed. discussion in this afinding as to count 4 -- that defendant was armed during the commission of the crime of being a felon in possession of a firearm, and therefore ineligible for resentencing for that count. his appeal is pr4 subdivision (e)(2)(c)(iii) and 1170.12, subdivision (c)(2)(c)(iii). defendant contends those statutory terms must be construed to the weapon and the commission of the underlying felony. defendant further contends such a facilitative nexus cannot exist when the underlying offense is possession of a firearm. i. standard of review and applicable legal principles question of law to which we apply the de novo standard of review. (people v. martinez (2014) 226 cal.app.4th interpretation of a ballot initiative is governed by the same rules that apply in construing a statute enacted by the legislature. people v. park (2013) 56 cal.4th 782, 796 (park).) of the enacting legislative body so that we may adopt the people v. albillar (2010) 51 cal.4th 47, 54-55.) because section 1170.126 was enacted by the electorate, it is the parkand usual meaning and viewing them in their statutory context, because the statutory language is usually the most reliable albillar, at p. 55.) if the language of the statute is ambiguous, we examine other ticularly the analysis and arguments contained in the official ballot pamphlet. (people v. briceno of the statute is not ambiguous, the plain meaning controls and resort to extrinsic sources to d5 albillarpark, at p. 796.) ii. overview of section 1170.126 in november 2012, voters in california approved proposition 36, which enacted section 1170.126. that statute established a procedure under which a defendant serving an indeterminate life sentence as a third strike offender for a non-serious or non-violent felony that was a strike under the pre-proposition 36 version of the three strikes law could file a petition for recall of sentence and request resentencing as a second strike offender for that offense. (teal v. superior court (2014) 60 cal.4th 595, 596-597.) under section 1170.126, an inmate serving an indeterminate third-strike term for a crime that is not a serious or violent felony may petition for resentencing, unless his third-strike offense comes within one of the statutory exceptions to eligibility. ( 1170.126, subd. (e).) one such exception applies . . . [the defendant] was armed with a firearm.(c)(2)(c)(iii), 667, subd. (e)(2)(c)(iii), 1170.126, subd. (e)(2).) iii. an inmate is ineligible for resentencing under section defendant used a firearm, was armed with a firearm or deadly weapon, or intended to cause great bodily injury to another (e)(2)(c)(iii) and 1170.12, subdivision (c)(2)(c)(iii).

(e.g.,  1203.06, subd. (b)(3); health & saf. code,  11370.1, subd. (a); people v. bland (1995) 10 cal.4th 991, 997 (bland) [construing  laws and judicial constructions in effect at the time legislation is light thereof citation]. osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1029.) principle [likewise] applies to legislation adopted through the osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1029.) courts have accordingly concluded that is used in sections 667, subdivision (e)(2)(c)(iii) and 1170.12, subdivision (c)(2)(c)(iii), and incorporated by reference in section osuna, at p. 1029; people v. white (2014) 223 cal.app.4th 512, 524.) defendant acknowledges the applicability of the foregoing subdivision (e)(2)(c)(iii) and 1170.12, subdivision (c)(2)(c)(iii) must be construed to mean that the arming must be in addition to, and not an element of, the current offense. he contends he was not armed because his possession of the weapon was not tethered to a separate offense, and there was no facilitative nexus 7 to the crime. numerous appellate courts have rejected that argument. (see, e.g., osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th 1020; people v. white, supra, 223 cal.app.4th 512; people v. blakely (2014) 225 cal.app.4th 1042; people v. brimmer (2014) 230 cal.app.4th 782; people v. hicks (2014) 231 cal.app.4th 275.) defendant urges us to reject this line of authority because courts in those cases incorrectly distinguished between arming commission of a felony, when a temporal nexus is sufficient. he legislative intent support his argument that the two terms can be used interchangeably, and that a facilitative nexus standard should apply when determining whether an inmate was armed resentencing under proposition 36. the distinction courts have drawn between being armed in which those terms are used. courts have distinguished between imposition of a sentence enhancement for anyone armed with a disqualification for sentencing relief under section 1170.126 if osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at pp. 1030-1031.) commission of facilitative nexus between the arming and the crime. (bland, supra, 10 cal.4th at p. 999.) no such facilitative nexus exists when the underlying crime is possession of a firearm by a felon, 8 (osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1032.) a defendant convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm accordingly does not risk imposition of additional punishment under section 12022. unlike sentence enhancement statutes such as section 12022, which require that a defendant be armed in the commission of a felony for additional punishment to be imposed, [proposition 36] disqualifies an inmate from eligibility for lesser punishment if he or she was armed with a firearm during the . in the context of requiring a temporal nexus between the arming and the (osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1032.) as the court in osuna curr[citation], and since at issue is not the imposition of additional punishment but rather eligibility for reduced punishment, we conclude the literal language of the [statute] disqualifies an inmate from resentencing if he or she was armed with a firearm ibid.) support for this interpretation of section 1170.126 may be of propositonly narrowly drawn categories of third strike offenders who committed particular, specified offenses or types of offenses, but also broadly inclusive categories of offenders who, during commission of their crimes -- statutory elements -- used a firearm, were armed with a firearm or deadly weapon, or intended to cause great bodily injury to osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1036), and 9 that the vrelated to proposition 36. these materials included statements the third strike conviction was for certain nonserious, non-violent sex or drug offenses or involved firearm possession.(ibid.) the court in osuna initiative measure would shorten sentences for some third strikers, the legislative analyst explained there would be some requires that if the offender has committed certain new or prior offenses, including some drug-, sex-, and gun-related felonies, he or she would still be subject to a life sentence under the three ibid.) the court in osuna conducted an extensive review of ballot materials that distinguished of simple drug possession) who posed little or no risk to the public convicted of two or more serious and/or violent felonies in the id. at in osuna rejected the claim that conviction for possession of a purposes of ineligibility for resentencing under section 1170.126. (ibid.) people v. estrada (2017) 3 cal.5th 661 (estrada) similarly negates the argument that there must be a facilitative nexus between being armed with a firearm and the underlying offense for a defendant to be ineligible for resentencing under proposition 36. the court in estrada only one express nexus requirement between [its] general 10 ffense: the excluding d]uring something that occurs throughout the duration of an event or at some point in its course. [citation.] the term implies, at a minimum, a need for a temporal connection between the although the need to establish such a nexus imposes certain limits on the applicability of the firearm-related exception, [proposition 36] could certainly have imposed an even stricter requirement for triggering the exception. (see [bland, supra,] 10 cal.4th [at p.] 1002 . . . because [proposition 36] does not do so, we may infer some kind of temporal limitation on the retroactive application of section estrada, at p. 670, fn. omitted.) defendant argues that estrada did not address the issue of whether arming must be tethered to the underlying offense, and the use, arming, and intent described in section 1170.12, subdivision (c)(2)(c)(iii) must have a more-than-coincidental relationshiestrada, supra, 3 cal.5th at p. 670, fn. 4.) while it is true that estrada did not decide the alseligibility for resentencing under proposition 36 should be serving sentences for the mere commission of a gun possession 11 the supreme court in estrada noted, as defendant does in this appeal, that proposition 36 specifies three categories of offenses that are ineligible for resentencing, and that the third from the other two. the first two categories of ineligible offenses (1170.12, subds. (c)(2)(c)(i) and (c)(2)(c)(ii)), the court explained, (c)(2)(provision there, but instead more general terms describing how estrada, supra, 3 cal.5th at p. 670.) the supreme court rejected any facilitative nexus requsubdivision (c)(2)(c)(iii) is best read as excluding from during commission of their crimes -- and regardless of those -- used a firearm, were armed with a firearm or deadly weapon, or intended to cause great estrada, at p. 670.) we reject defenexus or tethering test, a felon in possession of a firearm would always be found to armed simply because he is possession of a firearm and that all weapons offenses would therefore be ineligible for resentencing under proposition 36. the premise underlying this argument -- section 1170.12(c)(2)(c)(iii) is synonymous with simple possession of a firearm under former section 12021 -- is untrue. a defendant may be convicted of violating former section 12021 based on mere actual possession, [but] nonetheless under his dominion and 12 [citation.]osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1029, quoting people v. pena (1999) 74 cal.app.4th 1078, 1083-searched and a firearm is found next to his bed. the parolee is in possession of the firearm, because it is under his dominion and control. if he is not home at the time, however, he is not armed with the firearm, because it is not readily available to him for blakely, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1052.) such a defendant would be eligible for proposition 36 relief. (ibid.) in such a case, the facilitative nexus test would be of sections 1170.12, subdivision (c)(2)(c)(iii), and 667, subdivision (e)(2)(c)(iii), and thus eligible for relief under section 1170.126, subdivision (e)(2). a firearm cannot be available for use when it contrast, defendant had actual possession of the firearm and it was accordingly available for his use. the trial court did not err in ruling that defendant was of a firearm, and was thus ineligible for resentencing under proposition 36. disposition the order is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. ____________________________, j. chavez we concur: __________________________, p. j. lui __________________________, j. hoffstadt
