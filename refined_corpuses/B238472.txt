(pen. code,1  187, subd. (a), 189, 190.2, subd. (a)(21).) defendant was sentenced to life without the possibility of parole with a consecutive 25-years-to-life term. we affirm the judgment. ii. discussion a. the suppression motion the murder weapon was found in the attic of a home on still meadow lane in lancaster. in a pretrial motion under evidence code section 1538.5, defendant moved to suppress the firearm. the trial court found defendant had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the place searched; therefore, he could not object to the seizure. we conclude the trial court properly denied the suppression motion. amendment to the united states constitution. (people v. carter (2005) 36 cal.4th 1114, 1141; people v. mcpeters (1992) 2 cal.4th 1148, 1171, abrogated on another point as stated in people v. clark (2011) 52 cal.4th 856, 939.) the warrantless entry into the still meadow lane house was presumptively unconstitutional.

[citations.] we (people v. jenkins, supra, 22 cal.4th at p. 969; accord, people v. carter, supra, 36 cal.4th at p. 1140.) we conclude the thad no reasonable expectation of privacy in the attic of the still meadow lane home. the evidence presented at the suppression hearing was as follows. tianna turner gave defendant permission to stay at the residence. several other people also stayed in the home on a regular basis. defendant did not sleep in the home every night, but had stayed 4 there off and on for several months. he had a key to the front door. he had a key to his bedroom door, which he kept locked. he had moved possessions into the bedroom. meadow lane house, as his residence. when police officers entered the home, they found the downstairs rooms empty of furniture. there was a small amount of furniture and a mattress in an upstairs bedroom, defendant had not signed a rental agreement. defendant testified he agreed to provide food and maintenance in lieu of rent. ms. turner had signed an agreement to lease the home, but had not paid the rent. the owner was in the process of evicting her. an eviction notice had been posted on the door of the residence. the attic in which the firearm was found was not locked. there was no evidence defendant had specific permission to enter the attic or to store his firearm there. there was no evidence defendant had the ability to prevent others from entering the attic. there was no evidence he attempted to control or safeguard the attic after he placed his gun there. under all of the foregoing circumstances, defendant had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the attic of the still meadow lane home. (see people v. jenkins, supra, 22 cal.4th at p. 972; people v. mcpeters, supra, 2 cal.4th at p. 1172; people v. hernandez, supra, 199 cal.app.3d at pp. 1188-1190.) the trial court properly denied the suppression motion. b. confidential juror information defendant filed a post-verdict petition for release of confidential juror information under code of civil procedure section 237. defendant sought to investigate alleged jury juror, a male juror had discussed his personal experience with gangs during 5 deliberations.2 the trial court properly declined to consider evidence of how the male people v. williams (2006) 40 cal.4th 287, 333.) petition. as discussed below, defendant did not meet his threshold burden of showing good cause for a hearing. therefore, we find no abuse of discretion. pursuant to code of civil procedure sectiomay petition the court for access to [personal juror identifying information] records. the petition shall be supported by a declaration that includes facts sufficient to establish good cause for the release of the juro3 (italics added.) 2 defense counsel, angelyn gates, declared that post-trial she had contacted a about another male juror who really helped because he had information that the other jurors did not. . . . [] . . . according to the female juror, the male juror informed the other jurors that he had personal knowledge of gang related behavior, how gangs act, what they do anbecause he himself had been around gangs growing up and was, at one time, in a gang. the female juror told me that this male juror used his own personal experiences and knowledge of how people like [defendant] and the other young people involved in the case would have done things and that this information was used by the male juror to convince other jurors to adopt his views and opinions. [] . . . the female juror gave me an example of this as follows: the female juror was expressing her thoughts regarding why [defendant] would drive up to the alleged victim in the day time with a rifle to shoot him at close range as opposed to doing it from a distance where he would not be so easily seen. (this effects [sic] premeditation and intent.) the male juror told the female and r, [defendant], would information was something that the female juror took as accurate based upon the male done on the streets with people like [defendant]. the way the female juror explained the situation, it seemed clear that she was affected by the knowledge of the male juror and took that into consideration 3 code of civil procedumay petition the court for access to [personal juror identifying information] records. the petition shall be supported by a declaration that includes facts sufficient to establish good cause for 6 absent a showing of jury misconduct, there is no prima facie good cause for disclosure of juror information. (people v. carrasco (2008) 163 cal.app.4th 978, 991; people v. jefflo (1998) 63 cal.app.4th 1314, 1322.) our review is for an abuse of discretion. (people v. carrasco, supra, 163 cal.app.4th at p. 991; people v. santos (2007) 147 cal.app.4th 965, 978; see people v. carter (2003) 30 cal.4th 1166, 1216; townsel v. superior court (1999) 20 cal.4th 1084, 1097-1098.) defendant makes two arguments on appeal. first, the male juror concealed bias during voir dire questioning. second, the juror introduced outside information during deliberations that influenced other jurors. with respecconcealment of material information may constitute implied bias justifying disqualification or removal. (people v. wilson (2008) 44 cal.4th 758, 823; people v. tuggles (2009) 179 cal.app.4th in re carpenter (1995) 9 cal.4th 634, 657; see people v. granish (1996) 41 cal.app.4th 1117, 1131-1132.) here, defendant made no showing whatsoever in the trial court that the juror concealed relevant facts or gave false answers during voir dire examination. (see people v. wilson, supra, 44 cal.4th at p. 823; in re hitchings (1993) 6 cal.4th 97, 111-112; people v. tuggles, supra, 179 cal.app.4th at pp. 371-374.) defendant offered no evidence or discussion of the voir dire examination of the male juror. defendant makes no showing of juror misconduct during voir dire on appeal. as a result, we need not address the contention further. the matter for hearing if the petition and supporting declaration establish a prima facie showing of good cause for the release of the personal juror identifying information, but shall not set the matter for hearing if there is a showing on the record of facts that establish a compelling interest against disclosure. a compelling interest includes, but is not limited to, protecting jurors from threats or danger of physical harm. if the court does not set the matter for hearing, the court shall by minute order set forth the reasons and make express findings either of a lack of a prima facie showing of good cause or the 7 not shown the male juror brought misconduct by receiving or proffering to other jurors information about the case that was in re lucas (2004) 33 cal.4th 682, 696.) obtained from outside sources. such injection of external information in the form of a lized knowledge of a matter at issue is in re malone (1996) 12 cal.4th 935, 963; accord, people v. san nicolas knowledge they claim to possess.

(id. at p. 77.) the witness testified a friend sometimes punched in for him at work. (id. at p. 66.) one juror did not believe that testimony. id. at p. 66, fn. omitted.) our supreme court noted that the juror did not ignore or substitute his own beliefs for the id. at p. 77.) moreover, the court held, there was no juror place did not involve specialized information from an outside source. it was an application of his life experience, in the specific context of timecards and the workplace, that led him to conclude [the purported eyewitness] was not telling the truth about the to why his timecard indicated he was elsewhere. [citation.] [] . . . [the juror] drew on his own personal life experience to conclude this witness lacked credibility because of the id. at p. 78.) similarly, in people v. san nicolas, supra, ajor point of dispute during deliberations was whether [the victim] was dead at the time [she was] pressure and circulation. the defendant sought a new trial on juror misconduct grounds. the trial court denied the motion. our supreme court found no abuse of discretion: that [the juror] offered the jurors any basis for deciding the case other than the evidence and testimony presented at trial. . . . indeed, the remarks attributed to her . . . are consistent with the trial testimony of the pathologist . . . . the trial court did not abuse its 9 (id. at p. 650.) here, according to the female juror who spoke with defense counsel, the male juror brought into the deliberation process his personal experience with gangs. there was evidence the victim was associated with a gang. but there was no allegation defendant was a gang member or that he committed the present crime for the benefit of a gang. (see  186.22.) no expert testimony was offered concerning gangs. the male juror brought only his individual experience to bear on the deliberation process. he did not rely on specialized information from an outside source. defendant has not shown that the law. was merely an application of his life experience to the evidence. there was no prima facie showing of juror misconduct and no good cause to disclose juror information. the tr . . . a reasonable probability of actual harm to the complaining party [resulting from the people v. williams, supra, 40 cal.4th at p. 333; accord, people v. loker (2008) 44 cal.4th 691, 749.) here, it was undisputed defendant shot the victim at close range. why he did so was not a material issue. the dispositive question before the jury was whether defendant acted in self-defense. there is no reasonable probability of actual harm to defendant. 10 c. prosecutorial misconduct defendant asserts the prosecutor engaged in a pattern of misconduct throughout the engaged in misconduct; specifically, the prosecutor: questioned defendant about witness intimidation without any factual basis; intentionally elicited inadmissible testimony a neighbor saw defendant in possession of a 9-millimeter glock firearm; improperly attempted to shift the burden of proof to the defense during closing argument by questioning why certain named witnesses never testified for the defense; and misstated the law of imperfect self-defense during closing argument. the federal and state standards governing prosecutorial misconduct are as follows: . . intemperate behavior violates the federal constitution when it prosecutor that does not render a criminal trial fundamentally unfair is prosecutorial people v. hill (1998) 17 cal.4th 800, 819; accord, people v. vines (2011) 51 cal.4th 830, 873.) failure to object to the challenged conduct or to request a curative admonition bars presentation of a prosecutorial misconduct claim on appeal. (people v. stewart (2004) 33 cal.4th 425, 484; people v. farnam uld have people v. crew (people v. wallace (2008) 44 cal.4th 1032, 1071.) we find no prosecutorial misconduct. 11 1. the witness intimidation question t by intentionally eliciting inadmissible testimony. (people v. smithey people v. abel (2012) 53 cal.4th 891, 925.) as noted above, defendant asserts the prosecutor questioned defendant about witness intimidation without any factual basis. we conclude there was a while in county jail custody, in his telephone and in-person communications, defendant directed others to contact potential witnesses and make sure they would not threatened by the long range pimps, a party group. defendant was a member of the long range pimps. in november 2010, mr. thomas received a message from the long same time, someone put a bullet hole in the prosecutor asked defendant the following questions on cross-by [deputy district attorney ani] bailey: did the long range pimps also engage in intimidating witnesses like they did to brian thomas back in november of 2010? [] [angelyn] gates [for defendant]: objection. [] the witness: no. [] the court: ullet through there? [] a. no. [] q. okay. did you direct the long range pimps to intimidate brian thomas back in november of 2010: [] a. never. [] q. did you tell the long range pimps to go look for brian and to threaten him that if he te defendant attempted to influence witness testimony. in addition, defendant said he had 12 prosecutor could reasonably conclude defendant was behind the threat. there was no prosecutorial misconduct. the trial court held a hearing on the admissibility of a video recording of a party at the still meadow lane residence. the video recording depicted two individuals with guns. the trial court cautioned the prosecutor not to argue that either individual was defendant. defendant asserts that notwithstanding the tria . . . however, a prosecutor cannot be people v. tully (2012) 54 cal.4th 952, 1035.) here, the prosecutor did not anticipate the challenged testimony. the challenged testimony was as follows. moises briones lived next door to the still meadow lane house in lancaster. mr. briones had observed a large number of parties held on the neighboring property. he had seen people drinking, using drugs and displaying weapons. mr. briones recognized defendant from the neighboring house. when ms. bailey, the prosecutor, asked how mr. briones recognized defendant, with a weapon and on a motorcycle. [] q and what day was that? do you remember? [] a that was . . . [] q well, when you saw him with the weapon, what kind of weapon was it? [] a i am going to say probably a nine [millimeter] glock maybe. [] q what day was that? [] a march 17. at sidebar, defense counsel argued evidence defendant had been in possession of a glock firearm was inadmissible criminal propensity evidence. briones to say he had seen defendant with a rifle. that testimony would have been 13 re was no discovery violation; in earlier interviews and testimony, the witness had never mentioned a nine millimeter glock; hence the testimony was not expected. the trial court struck the testimony and admonished the jury to disregard it. defendant has not shown that the prosecutor intentionally elicited inadmissible testimony. (see people v. tully, supra, 54 cal.4th at pp. 1035, 1040; people v. valdez (2004) 32 cal.4th 73, 125.) even if we were convinced the prosecutor committed misconduct, it is not reasonably probable the result would have been more favorable to defendant absent the misconduct. (see people v. arias (1996) 13 cal.4th 92, 161 [no reversal for prosecutorial misconduct absent prejudice]; people v. stansbury (1993) 4 cal.4th 1017, 1057, revd. on other grounds in stansbury v. california (1994) 511 u.s. 318, 325-327 [same].) the jury was admonished to disregard the testimony. moreover, the jury was fully aware defendant had possessed weapons. defendant testified at trial he had possessed firearms in the past and had been arrested for firearm possession. and during a recorded in-rded in-custody telephone conversation, this time with kristen gallion, defendant commented, prejudiced defendant. 3. the burden of proof argument district attorney samantha sadinsky,4 improperly attempted to shift the burden of proof 4 the people were represented by ms. bailey and ms. sadinsky. 14 to the defense during closing argument by questioning why certain named witnesses never testified for the defense. the prosecutor commented on the absence of particular witnesses to 5 5 so why not put on a full defense? why not call all of the witnesses that could reasonably tell us why he acted in self-defense. [] the first person is becca. [during jailhouse conversations with others, defendant said becca knew what had happened.] and, again, there is no reasonable explanation. he has not been able to explain why . . . [] . . . he cannot explain why he says becca is there. there is no reasonable explanation for this statement by the defendant. [] go ahead and listen to all these phone calls all over again, if you need to see the context of it; but it is clear when he is talking to cheyanna garcia that he is talking about becca being in the car with him during the murder, because if she knew anything different than the people at the still because she was there. [] . . . [] if becca was actually there, which [is] the only reasonable explanation is that she was, then she would be the most logical witness to call, because she would be there to say: i have first-hand knowledge that boy had a gun. derel smith had a gun and he did what he had to do and i was there and i saw the whole corroborate what the defendant wants you to believe. nobody can. [] . . . [] if he actually acted in self-defense, he would have told at least somebody and becca would be randy is allegedly somebody who was pressured by the police and makes it look really going to get caught up in a murder and become an accomplice, but he was scared because where is monique? monique apparently heard this threat from derel . . . smith. where is she to come in and say: you know, i knew that derel was this crazy violent gang the phone over what went on. to think that he did not ever tell her what happened or that know, after the murder, he came to me and said he acted in self-defense. [] she also ck up any of what the defendant says about what happened that day, about being dropped off at work, and then he comes back later to pick her up or she goes to witness who apparently had her own personal interaction with derel smith, where he was smith is so violent. . . . [] and peaches, who allegedly had blood running down her 15 to the jury that a defendant has not brought forth evidence to corroborate an essential part people v. varona (1983) 143 cal.app.3d 566, 570; see people v. gaines (1997) 54 cal.app.4th 821, 825.) the prosecutor may comment on the failure of the defense to call logical witnesses. (people v. lewis (2009) 46 cal.4th 1255, 1304, citing people v. vargas (1973) 9 cal.3d 470, 475; see people v. johnson (1992) 3 cal.4th witnesses who might have corroborated the defense. there was no misconduct. 4. the imperfect self-defense argument defendant asserts the prosecutor misstated the law as to imperfect self defense. it is prosecutorial misconduct to misstate the applicable law during argument to the jury. (people v. huggins (2006) 38 cal.4th 175, 253, fn. 21; people v. otero (2012) 210 cal.app.4th 865, 870.) again, we find no misconduct. or when the -the unreasonable but good faith belief in having to act in self-defense people v. blakeley (2000) 23 cal.4th 82, 87--defense is the killing of another human being under the actual but unreasonable belief that the killer was in imminent danger of death or great people v. booker (2011) 51 cal.4th 141, 182.)6 face and she was really beaten up and the cops come and talk to her, specifically, and she has no injuries whatsoever. [] . . . [] . . . so where are all these witnesses? [] . . . [] . . . so where are all these witnesses to support the defend 6 the jury was instructed on imperfect self-defense as it relates to voluntary reduced to voluntary manslaughter if the defendant killed a person because he acted in imperfect self-defense. [] if you conclude the defendant acted in complete self-defense, 16 during her rebuttal closing argument to the jury, ms. sadinsimperfect self-defense is an actual belief that [defendant] was in imminent danger of death or great bodily injury and he acted to avoid being killed himself. and an actual belief that he must use deadly force. but one of those actual beliefs on behalf of the -defense. (people v. breverman, supra, 19 cal.4th at pp. 153-154.) defendant has not challenged that argument. defendant takes issue with ms. saconsider what a reasonable person in the same situation as the defendant would have believed, not [what] the defendant would have believed, not what the defendant would have believed or claims to have believed but what a reasonable personwhich mr. hatcher clearly is not-defense claim, not his imperfect self-defense theory. there was no misstatement of the law of imperfect self-defense. d. parole revocation fine defendant asserts the trial court imposed an unauthorized $10,000 parole imposition of a $10,000 restitution fine ( 1202.4, subd. (b)) and a $10,000 parole his action was lawful and you must find him not guilty of any crime. the difference between complete self-defense and imperfect self-defense depends on whether the acted in imperfect self-defense if: [] 1. the defendant actually believed that he was in imminent danger of being killed or suffering great bodily injury; [] and [] 2. the defendant actually believed that the immediate use of deadly force was necessary to defend against the danger; [] but [] 3. at least one of those beliefs was people v. breverman (1998) 19 cal.4th 142, 153-154.) 17 section 1202.4, subdivision (f). the oral pronouncement of judgment controls over the minutes or the abstract of judgment.
