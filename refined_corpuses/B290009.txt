[citations.] courts have given the (ibid.) whether a particular facility is sufficiently restrictive to (people v. ambrose (1992) 7 cal.app.4th 1917, 1922.) factors relevant to the determination include the extent to which freedom of movement 10 is restricted, the extent of regulations governing visitation, the s rules regarding personal appearance and other conduct, s daily schedule. (id. at p. 1921.) restrictive residential treatment facilities may be found custodial. (see people v. rodgers (1978) 79 cal.app.3d 26, 31.) a defendant bears the burden of demonstrating his or her entitlement to presentence custody credit. (people v. shabazz (2003) 107 cal.app.4th 1255, 1258.) iv. appellant did not carry his burden. on july 26, 2017, the trial court amended its original judgment to award appellant an additional 246 days of custody credit for the time he spent at the midnight mission and 10 days of custody credit for the time he spent at union rescue mission. appellant contends that he also should have received 121 days for the time he spent at lamp/the people concern, and 69 days for the time he spent at the weingart center; he appears to have abandoned his contention that he spent 60 days at union rescue mission. the letters he attached to his briefs do not demonstrate that appellant is entitled to additional custody credit. neither letter shows that appellant enrolled in the programs pursuant to an order of the court or in connection with his conviction or probation. the remainder of the appellate record likewise provides no suggestion that appellant participated in these programs as a result of his conviction. [a] prisoner is not entitled to credit for presentence confinement unless he shows that the conduct which led to his conviction was the sole reason (people v. bruner (1995) 9 cal.4th 1178, 1191.) that showing was not made here. 11 the record also contains no information demonstrating that the letter from the people concern states that appellant utilized its not suggestive of either mandatory enrollment or restrictive conditions. similarly, the email from the weingart center indicates that appellant utilized suggest that appellant was free to leave. without more, we cannot conclude that the trial court erred in awarding appellant a total of 302 days of custody credit. afor replacement counsel is denied. the email from the weingart center was addressed to counsel, indicating that the letter from the people concern is addressed more generallybut was sent to a fax machine, again indicating v. wende review we have independently reviewed the entire record. we are satisfied that no arguable issues exist and appellant has received effective appellate review of the judgment entered against him.
