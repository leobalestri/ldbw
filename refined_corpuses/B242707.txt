(houston, supra, at p. 1216, quoting people v. lee (2011) 51 cal.4th 620, 636; see people v. gonzalez (2012) 54 cal.4th 643, 663.) they are simply intended to guide killing occurred as the result of preexisting reflection rather than unconsidered or rash (houston, supra, at p. 1216; accord, people v. streeter (2012) 54 cal.4th 205, 242.) the court may also consider other evidence that supports a finding of 8 premeditation and deliberation. (see people v. prince (2007) 40 cal.4th 1179, 1253; people v. gonzalez, supra, 210 cal.app.4th at p. 887.of these categories of evidence be accorded a particular weight [citation], and it is not essential that there be evidence of gonzalez, supra, 210 cal.app.4th at p. 887.) in determining the sufficiency of the evidence proving premeditation and deliberation, we review the entire record in the light most favorable to the people to determine whether it contains evidence that is reasonable, credible, and of solid value, from which a rational trier of fact could find [premeditation and deliberation] beyond a people v. marks (2003) 31 cal.4th 197, 230; see people v. davis (2013) 57 cal.4th 353, 357.) we may only reverse for insufficient evidence if it appears that under no hypothesis whatever is there sufficient substantial evidence to people v. zamudio (2008) 43 cal.4th 327, 357; people v. mecano (2013) 214 cal.app.4th 1061, 1068.) 2. analysis the record contains substantial evidence of premeditation and deliberation. cthreat. he believed that if and that no one should mess with cambodia. it was with this mindset that chhom retrieved his tec-9 semiautomatic pistol from under his pillow and set out to implement his plan to shoot and kill rodriguez. the manner of the attempted murder also demonstrates premeditation and deliberation. when rodriguez saw that chhom had a gun, rodriguez did not put up any struggle. he merely asked chhom if he was going to shoot him. chhom then shot rodriguez once at close range. while rodriguez was on the ground, chhom shot him two more times and then calmly walked back to his trailer. each of the rounds that chhom fired hit rodriguez in the upper portion of his body, inflicting serious injuries to his face, neck, chest and shoulders. method of shooting was sufficiently 9 with a preconceived design. (people v. caro (1988) 46 cal.3d 1035, 1050; see people v. mendoza, supra, 52 cal.4th at p. people v. halvorsen (2007) 42 cal.4th 379, 422 [defendant shot victims in the head or neck from within a few feet]; people v. marks, supra, 31 cal.4th at p. 230 [shooting manifested all three factors relevant to the premeditation and deliberation equation].) therefore, the record contains substantial evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that rodriguez was willful, premeditated, and deliberate. (people v. watkins, supra, 55 cal.4th at p. 1026.) b. the trial court did not err by admitting hearing testimony because of his unavailability chhom argues that rodriguez was not unavailable as a witness for sixth amendment purposes and that the admission of his preliminary hearing testimony violated constitutional right to confrontation. we conclude that the trial court properly ruled that rodriguez was unavailable and that his prior testimony was admissible. 1. applicable law and standard of review a criminal defendant is constitutionally guaranteed the right to confront adverse witnesses.

analysis on june 6, 2012, three weeks before trial began. the people were unsuccessful because rodriguez had moved. on june 12, however, an investigator located rodriguez and served him with a subpoena, although it was the wrong type of subpoena. on june 14 the investigator served rodriguez with a proper out-of-county subpoena and told him to , which would make his travel arrangements. the subpoena directed rodriguez to appear in court on june 18, 2012. when rodriguez office, deputy district attorney jose gonzalez asked the trial court to issue and hold a bench warrant. on june 20, 2012 gonzalez spoke with rodriguez who was cooperative and agreed to testify at trial. gonzalez advised rodriguez that a witness coordinator would contact him and make the necessary travel arrangements. the witness coordinator attempted to contact rodriguez the next day but was unable to reach him until june 25, at the peoreliable. 12 which time rodriguez was upset. at the request of the coordinator, gonzalez called rodriguez and spoke with him for s angeles. gonzalez, who knew that the court had already issued and held a bench warrant on june 18, warned rodriguez that the court would issue a warrant for his arrest if he did not comply. gonzalez told rodriguez that he would prefer to fly rodriguez down to los angeles and put him up in a hotel than to have him arrested. at the end of the conversation rodriguez agreed to appear. gonzalez assured rodriguez that he would also pay for a caretaker to accompany him. rodriguez stated that he did not have a caretaker but would ask his sister to accompany him. rodriguez said he would call back, but never did. attempts to contact rodriguez on june 26 were unsuccessful. on june 27, 2012 trial commenced. gonzalez informed the trial court that rodriguez had become uncooperative and asked the court to lift the hold on the bench warrant so that we can proceed with trying to bring him to los angeles county.that bail be set at, certainly, a high enough amount where he would not be cited out. the court issued t]he bench warrant and set bail at $50,000. gonzalez advised the court that rodriguez wand questioned whether the investigators rodriguez might need medical clearance before law enforcement officials could transport him. on julhad testified, gonzalez advised the trial court that he had not had any further contact with rodriguez and that given his fragile medical state, law enforcement was unwilling to transport him and assume liability for doing so. gonzalez asked the trial court to declare rodriguez unavailable and to admit his preliminary hearing testimony into evidence. counsel for chhom se witnesses. 13 the trial court held a due diligence hearing at which detective frescas testified that she had christine in fresno on june 27 and asked whether she and her brother were going to appear in court. christine told detective frescas that her brother was adamant about not coming to court because he was physically unable and did not want to appear. detective frescas asked christine if she were 100 percent sure. christine said yes and that rodriguez would not be available. the detective conveyed this information to t testified that he located rodriguez in fresno with the assistance of shelley sweeten, an investigator from fresno. sweeten, who met with rodriguez, informed felix that ,, and appeared to weigh less than 100 pounds. rodriguez told sweeten that he was on a feeding tube and had difficulty walking. according to felix, it initially appeared as if rodriguez would cooperate, but he changed his mind. when felix spoke to rodriguez and his sister, they made it clear that rodriguez was not physically well enough to travel from fresno to los angeles. gonzalez told felix that on june 27, 2012 the court had issued a bench warrant and set bail at $50,000. contacted his supervisor to find out whether he could take rodriquez into custody and, it would be feasible to transport him. , which apprised him that, in order to bring rodriguez to los angeles, rodriguez would have to be in custody there would have to medical clearance there would have to be an order of the rodriguez from fresno to los angeles. felix learned, however, that th was not medically equipped to provide for custodial transportation from fresno to los angeles. s testimony, gonzalez asked the court to issue an order authorizing law enforcement to take rodriguez into custody to evaluate whether he was medically fit for transportation to los angeles. gonzalez argued this was necessary in order to ascertain true physical condition because rodriguez was not 14 responding or answering his phone. gonzalez goes beyond just the want to be here, and he wants to completely disregard this court the trial court was unsure whether rodriguez was uncooperative or physically unable to appear. the somethe prosecutor argued, blatantly disregarding the court order. the prosecutor again asked the court to issue an order to take rodriguez into custody and to a medical facility to determine whether he was fit to travel. the trial court declined to make such an order, sto sign an order that would j the prosecution then called joyce berry, the witness assistant in the district to testify further on the issue of due diligence. berry recounted that she first made contact with rodriguez on june 25, identified herself, and told rodriguez that he was needed in court. rodriguez said he needed a caregiver to accompany him. berry asked rodriguez if he had any family members who could come to court with him, and rodriguez said he would ask one of his sisters and then get back to berry. rodriguez told berry that he had health and money issues. berry made the travel arrangements. specifically, she arranged for rodriguez and christine to fly from fresno to los angeles on june 28 and to stay at the sheraton hotel in pasadena. when berry called rodriguez on june 26 to let him know about the travel arrangements, rodriguez said he was resting and asked berry to call him later. berry was never able to reach him later on june 26 or june 27, despite her numerous attempts. berry was able to reach christine, who stated that she was aware of the situation and would be traveling with rodriguez. christine explained that she could not speak with 15 berry at that time because rodriguez was receiving medical treatment. christine wrote l her later. christine did not call back. at 12:15 p.m. berry again called christine, who said that she had not spoken with her brother. berry told christine that the court was prepared to issue a warrant , but the district attorney did not want that to become necessary. berry asked christine to talk to her brother and let him know he was needed in court. christine said she would call berry back by 1:30 p.m., which she did not do. at 3:30 p.m. berry again called christine, who said her brother was not feeling well and was not going to appear in court. christine said that rodriguez did not care if he was arrested. ino rodriguez, sr., also testified. he had seen his son rodriguez sr. said his son weighed 75 pounds, was in a wheelchair, had a feeding tube in his stomach, and was unable to walk unassisted. rodriguez sr. did not think his son could travel on a plane, but might be able to travel to los angeles by car. at the conclusion of the hearing tcondition did not prevent him from coming to court, but that rodriguez was nevertheless unavailable. in analyzing whether the people had demonstrated that they had exercised reasonable diligence within the meaning of evidence code section 240, subdivision (a)(5), the court relied on people v. cogswell, supra, 48 cal.4th 467, in which the supreme court held that the prosecution did not have to arrest the victim of a crime and bring him into court in order to establish due diligence.9 the trial court ruled 9 the victim in cogswell preliminary hearing but refused to appear for trial despite having been subpoenaed in accordance with the uniform act to secure the attendance of witnesses from without the state in criminal cases ( failure to utilize a provision in the uniform act did not preclude a finding of due diligence. (people v. cogswell, supra, 48 cal.4th at p. 471.) the supreme court 16 that rodriguez was unavailable under cogswell and therefore preliminary hearing testimony. having independently reviewed the evidence of the to bring rodriguez to the trial, we conclude that the people satisfied their burden of proving that they exercised due diligence in attempting to secure rodriguez presence and testimony at trial. five different individuals (gonzalez, frescas, felix, berry, and sweeten) made contact with rodriguez or christine in an effort to make sure rodriguez came to court. rodriguez hampered these efforts by often not answering his phone and not returning phone calls, vacillating between cooperation and lack of cooperation, and ultimately refusing to come to court. the people timely served rodriguez with a subpoena directing him to appear on june 18, and immediately asked the court to issue and hold a bench warrant when rodriguez failed to make contact by that date. on the first day of trial, when it became clear that rodriguez would not come to court voluntarily, gonzalez asked the trial court to release the hold on the warrant and to set bail in a substantial amount. the people sought an order to have rodriguez arrested so that he could be evaluated to determine whether he could travel to los angeles, but the trial court was unwilling make such an order the trial court ultimately determined that such an order was unnecessary under people v. cogswell, supra, 48 cal.4th 467, and declared rodriguez unavailable. we agree with the trial court that under cogswell the people did not need to arrest rodriguez in order for the trial court to find that the people had acted with reasonable diligence. given to have arrested rodriguez would have been a drastic measure with potentially adverse health consequences for rodriguez. (see people v. cogswell, supra, 48 cal.4th at pp. 477- measure so drastic thid. at pp. 477-478.) 17 478.) the people did virtually all they could, and their efforts were more than reasonable under the circumstances. in light of the people, we conclude that the people satisfied the requirements of evidence code section 1291 and that rodriguez was unavailable. therefore, constitutional right of confrontation. disposition the judgment is affirmed. segal, j.* we concur: perluss, p. j. woods, j. * judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
