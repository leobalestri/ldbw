(people v. langston (2004) 33 cal.4th 1237, 1241 [an enhancement for a 4 prior prison term is mandatory unless stricken].) it appears from the record the court . we therefore modify the and strike the two section 667.5, subdivision (b), enhancements. the march 20, 2013 minute order and abstract of judgment show a restitution fine in the amount of $140, rather than $280 as the trial court orally imposed. accordingly, we order the minute order and the abstract of judgment corrected to reflect the amount of the restitution fine actually imposed.
