(see smith v. robbins (2000) 528 u.s. 259, 277-284.) on august 13, 2015, we advised defendant he had 30 days within which to personally submit any contentions or arguments he wished us to consider. no response has been received. we have examined the entire record and there are no grounds to modify the august 22, 1997 indeterminate sentence. defendant was convicted on october 7, 1982, of deadly weapon assault. (pen. code1,  245, subd. (a); stats. 1980, ch. 1340,  3.2, p. 4719.) on december 21, 1988, defendant was convicted following a jury trial of two counts of second-degree robbery. ( 211.) on june 17, 1997, defendant was again convicted of second degree robbery. on august 22, 1997, defendant received an indeterminate 35-years-to-life sentence. he received 25 years to life for the second degree robbery conviction. ( 667, subd. (e)(2)(a), 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(a); stats.1994, ch. 12,  1, pp. 71, 74; stats. 1994, initiative statutes, prop. 184, pp. a-314, a-316.) in addition, defendant received two additional section 667, subdivision (a) five year enhancements because of his prior 1988 serious felony convictions the prior serious felony conviction enhancement was later reduced to five years. on may 24, 2000, defendant was formally resentenced to a term of 30 years to life. it is this indeterminate sentence that defendant challenged in the trial court in his motion to correct a legally unauthorized sentence. in the trial court, defendant relied upon people v. vargas (2014) 59 cal.4th 635, 638-639. in vargas, our supreme court held: defendants two prior felony convictionsone for robbery and one for carjackingwere not only tried in the same proceeding and committed during the same course of criminal conduct, they were based 1 further statutory references are to the penal code. 3 on the same act, committed at the same time, against the same victim. as we explain, because neither the electorate ( 1170.12) nor the legislature ( 667, subds. (b)-(i)) could have intended that both such prior convictions would qualify as separate strikes under the three strikes law, treating them as separate strikes is inconsistent with the spirit of the three strikes law, and the trial court should have dismissed one of them and sentenced defendant as if she had only one, not two, qualifying strike convictions. (people v. vargas, supra, 59 cal.4th at pp. 638-639.) in the trial court, citing vargas, defendant contended his two 1988 robbery convictions stemmed from the same act and should be treated as only one qualifying prior felony conviction. in 1988, defendant was convicted of robbing a flower shop. defendant robbed both the manager and a customer. thus, because there were two separate victims, vargas has no application to the present case. (ibid.; people v. rusconi (2015) 236 cal.app.4th 273, 275, 281.) the may 4, 2015 order denying defendants resentencing motion is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports turner, p. j. we concur: mosk, j. kriegler, j.
