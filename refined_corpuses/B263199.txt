(people v. mendez (nov. 14, 2000, b138160) [nonpub. opn.].)1 mendez filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus 13 years later, challenging the restitution order made at trial and arguing that a defendant cannot suffer more than one strike in a single case. the trial court (judge eric c. taylor) summarily denied the september 26, 2013. on november 14, 2013  1170.126, which the trial court (judge william c. ryan) deemed a petition for recall of sentence under proposition 36 (pen. code,  1170.126). in denying the petition the court found one of s was for attempted murder, making him ineligible for resentencing under proposition 36. (pen. code,  1170.126, subd. (e)(3), 667, subd. (e)(2)(c)(iv)(iv).) 1 appeal, was summarily denied. 3 on november 18, 2014 mendez filed yet another petition for writ of habeas corpus in the trial court, which judge taylor summarily denied, stating the issues mendez raised had been previously considered and decided by the trial court and on appeal. judicial notice; motion for request for resentencing; petition for recall of sentence pursuant to supreme court of california case people v. vargas, case number s203744 2 on february 27, 2015 judge [t]here are no new facts [or] law presented. further, a motion for reconsideration is not an appropriate motion on this in his notice of appeal, filed april 1, 2015, order of february 26, [sic[s] 1170.18 (a) and (f), a reference to penal code provisions added by proposition 47, and requests that we take judicial notice of three cases pending before the california supreme court, which he contends demonstrate he is entitled to relief under propositions 36 and 47 and penal code section 1385 in light of people v. vargas (2014) 59 cal.4th 635 (vargas). we appointed counsel to represent mendez on appeal. after an examination of the record, counsel filed an opening brief in which no issues were raised. on october 26, 2015 we advised mendez he had 30 days in which to personally submit any contentions or issues he wished us to consider. after granting one extension of time, on january 12, 2016 we received a 38-page typewritten identiary 27, 2015 order denying a motion for reconsideration of issues raised in prior habeas corpus petitions and a request for resentencing in light of a then-recent california supreme court decision (vargas) generally teal v. superior court (2014) 60 cal.4th 2 this document is not part of the record on appeal. 4 595, 601; people v. totari (2002) 28 cal.4th 876, 886; people v. gallardo (2000) 77 cal.app.4th 971, 984-985entirely devoid of merit. to the extent mendez is claiming he is entitled to be resentenced under proposition 47, he failed to petition for such relief in the trial court in accordance with penal code section 1170.18. to the extent he proposition 36 petition, the court properly determined in rejecting a prior resentencing request that his prior convictions for attempted murder make him ineligible for relief; and, as the court ruled on february 27, 2015, there are no new facts or law that would mandate a different result now. to the extent mendez is asserting he was improperly sentenced as a third strike offender under vargas, supra, 59 cal.4th 635, the decision does not apply to him because he was convicted of three felonies for the attempted murder of three victims, same time, against the same victim. (id. at p. 638.) the additional issues raised in his supplemental brief, to the extent they can be understood, are beyond the scope of this appeal or have no merit based on the record before us. mendez argues his 1988 plea agreement was breached, the three strikes law is unconstitutional, he was not properly informed of the consequences of his 1988 plea, and his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance.3 we have examined the record and are satisfied s attorney has fully complied with the responsibilities of counsel and no arguable issue exists.
