(b)-(i), 1170.12, subds. (a)-(d)) and four prior serious felony convictions ( 667, subd. (a)(1)). appellant contends on appeal that the trial court erred in finding the evidence sufficient to establish the four felony priors were brought and tried separately as required by section 667, subdivision (a)(1). he further contends that the trial court erred in imposing separate punishments for the robbery and false imprisonment counts rather than staying one of the sentences pursuant to section 654. four serious felony priors were brought and tried separately for purposes of section 667. however, we further conclude that the trial court did not err in imposing separate sentences for the robbery and false imprisonment counts. because we conclude that the evidence does not support the imposition of four enhancements under section 667, subdivision (a)(1), we vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing and a retrial on the enhancement allegations, if the prosecution so elects. in all other respects, we affirm the judgment. factual and procedural background prosecution evidence norma morales owned a warehouse business in la puente, california. on june 15, 2011, around 4:30 p.m., she entered the business and closed the door. as 1 all further statutory references are to the penal code. 3 soon as she closed the door, appellant opened the door and sprayed her in the face with wd-40. he closed the door, told her not to scream, and demanded money. morales had never seen appellant before. she identified him at trial. appellant asked morales for her purse, then took it from a nearby table. when she tried to pull the purse away from him, he punched her above her right eye and told her to move to the corner of the room, approximately 10 to 12 feet away, and to sit down. appellant searched money. he told morales to stay where she was, and he began to bind her hands, feet, and mouth with tape he found in the office. while doing so, he noticed her wedding ring and told her to give it to him. she complied, and he left. before leaving, he accidentally dropped the ring. morales was able to free herself, ran to in the same building and called the police. manuel calderon worked as a security guard at the warehouse. he identified appellant at trial and stated that he had seen appellant and his friends the property more than once. surveillance video on the day of the incident showed appellant walking on the property around 4:30 p.m. and then running away from the property around 4:50 p.m. investigate the incident approximately a year-and-a-half after it occurred. he interviewed morales in november 2012 and showed her a six-pack photographic . morales identified appellant as her assailant. after appellant was arrested, he admitted spraying morales and tying her up. 4 defense evidence appellant did not present any evidence. procedural background appellant was charged by amended information with four counts: (1) robbery ( 211), (2) false imprisonment by violence ( 236), (3) commercial burglary ( 459), and (4) kidnapping to commit robbery ( 209, subd. (b)(1)). the information further alleged that appellant had suffered four three strikes convictions ( 667, subds. (b)-(i), 1170.12, subds. (a)-(d)) and four prior serious felony convictions ( 667, subd. (a)(1)). appellant pleaded not guilty and denied the allegations. conviction allegations were bifurcated, and a jury trial commenced. following the the kidnapping charge. the jury found appellant guilty of the remaining three charges. appellant waived his right to a jury trial on his prior convictions. at the court trial, the prosecution introduced into evidence an abstract of judgment for case no. va023577, showing that appellant was convicted in october 1992 on three counts of second degree robbery ( 211) and one count of assault with a deadly weapon ( 245, subd. (a)(1)).2 the trial court found true the allegations of four prior strikes and four prior serious felony convictions. the court sentenced appellant to a term of 70 years, calculated as follows: count 1, 25 years to life; count 2, consecutive term of 25 2 the prosecution also introduced appellanthistory within the prison system, fingerprint cards, and a photograph. in addition, a regarding the documents. 5 years to life; count 3, 25 years to life, stayed pursuant to section 654; 20 years for the four prior convictions pursuant to section 667, subdivision (a)(1). appellant filed a timely notice of appeal. discussion i. prior serious felony convictions appellant contends that the evidence was insufficient to establish that the four serious felony priors were brought and tried separately as required by section 667, subdivision (a)(1). we agree. section 667 provides in relevant part that any person convicted of a serious felony who previously has been convicted of a serious felony . . . shall receive, in addition to the sentence imposed by the court for the present offense, a five-year enhancement for each such prior conviction on charges brought and tried 667, subd. (a)(1).) underlying proceedings must have been formally distinct, from filing to in re harris (1989) 49 cal.3d 131, 136 (harris).) charges brought and tried people v. wilson (2013) 219 cal.app.4th 500, 510 (wilson).) people v. delgado (2008) 43 cal.4th 1059, 1065.) reasonable trier of fact could have found that the prosecution sustained its burden. 6 people v. towers (2007) 150 cal.app.4th 1273, 1277.) in harris, the petitioner received two separate five-year enhancements for prior robbery convictionfrom a single proceeding which was initiated through the filing of a single complaint in municipal court and was followed by a single preliminary hearing in the same court; the original proceeding was thereafter prosecuted in superior court harris, supra, 49 cal.3d at p. 134.) the california supreme court underlying proceedings must have been formally distinct, from filing to id. at p. 136.) because the two convictions were initiated in a single complaint, the petitioner was subject to only one five-year enhancement under section 667. (id. at pp. 136-137.) in the instant case, rconvictions were based on four separate incidents that occurred on three separate dates, based on the prosecution sentencing memorandum and the transcript of the sentencing hearing, where the court read aloud the portions of the sentencing memorandum. according to the memorandum, the prior serious felonies occurred as follows: (1) on july 11, 1992, appellant stabbed a man; (2) on july 15, 1992, he robbed a victim of his car; (3) on july 15, 1992, he robbed a market; (4) on july 16, 1992, he robbed a convenience store. assuming that the sentencing memorandum is correct as to the sequence of the prior crimes, it does not establish that they were brought and tried separately. ( 667, subd. (a)(1); harris, supra, 49 cal.3d at p. 136; see people v. deay (1987) 194 cal.app.3d 280 7 argument that the defendant should receive two enhancements under 667 because the only evidence regarding the proceedings that resulted in prior convictions is an abstract of judgment, which shows that appellant was convicted on october 30, 1992 of four counts in case no. va023577: three second degree robbery counts and one assault count. he was sentenced to five years on count 3, robbery, and one-year consecutive terms each on counts 1 (assault), 2 (robbery), and 4 (robbery). in addition, he received enhancements under sections 12022.5 and 12022.7, for a total term of 15 years, 4 months. thus, given that appellant was convicted and sentenced in the same proceeding, and there is no evidence that the underlying proceedings were formally distinct in any way (harris, supra, 49 cal.3d at p. 136), it appears that the four crimes were not brought and tried separately as required by section 667, subdivision (a)(1). the decisions on which respondent relies -- people v. wagner (1994) 21 cal.app.4th 729 (wagner), people v. smith (1992) 7 cal.app.4th 1184 (smith), and people v. gonzales (1990) 220 cal.app.3d 134 (gonzales) do not change this conclusion. unlike the present case, those decisions involved convictions that were brought separately and sentenced separately, but obtained through guilty pleas entered in single proceedings. thus, in wagner, the defendant prior convictions (wagner, supra, 21 cal.app.4th at p. 732.) the defendant pled guilty to the two separate complaints ibid.) in addition, the clerk of the court noted the necessity of specifying 8 ibid.) on appeal, the appellate court held that the cases were brought and tried separately because the convictions originated in separate complaints, the complaints retained their separate character, and the defendant entered a separate plea on each and was sentenced separately on each. (id. at p. 737.) similarly, the prior convictions in smith e of the cases was consolidated. (smith, supra, 7 cal.app.4th at p. 1189.) the record in smith -work references to the cases were separate with files for each case and transcripts showing each case was dealt with by its separate id. ibid.) the appellate the guilty pleas were taken on the same date. . . . obvious considerations of judicial efficiency called for that type of processing the multiple cases of a single ibid.) the decision in gonzales, supra, 220 cal.app.3d at page 144, in which the charges were sentencing. here, as we have explained, there is no evidence that the charges were handled in formally distinct proceedings. thus, the evidence is not sufficient to uphold the imposition of four separate enhancements. we therefore reverse the sentence and remand for resentencing. double jeopardy will not bar the retrial of a prior conviction allegation after reversal on the ground of evidentiary insufficiency. people v. scott (2000) 85 cal.app.4th 905, 908, see people v. monge (1997) 16 cal.4th 826, 843.) on remand, therefore, the prosecution, if it chooses, 9 may present additional evidence, if any, that might establish that the charges were tried and brought separately. (people v. roberts (2011) 195 cal.app.4th 1106, 1133; see also people v. barragan (2004) 32 cal.4th 236, 239 [retrial of a strike allegation permissible where a trier of fact finds the allegation to be true but an appellate court reverses]; people v. griffis (2013) 212 cal.app.4th 956, 965 [on remand after reversal for iople will have the opportunity to introduce new evidence that the priors qualified as a strike, if ].) ii. section 654 appellant contends that the court improperly imposed separate punishments for the robbery and false imprisonment charges because they were committed in an indivisible course of conduct pursuant to a single objective within the meaning of section 654. howeimplicit conclusion that the robbery and false imprisonment had different intents and objectives. course of conduct.
