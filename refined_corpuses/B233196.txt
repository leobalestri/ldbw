(b)). the trial court imposed consecutive terms as to each of counts 2 and 3 as follows: one-third the middle term, doubled to two years, one-third the weapon enhancement (six years six months), and one-third the gang enhancement (three years three months), for a total as to each count of 11 years 9 months. in addition, the trial court imposed five years due to the prior conviction under section 667.5, subdivision (a), for a total sentence of 68 years 6 months in prison. the court sentenced frias to a total of 54 years 6 months in prison. the sentence as to count 1 was comprised of the middle term of three years, plus a 20-year enhancement under section 12022.53, subdivision (c), for personally and intentionally discharging a gun, and a 10-year gang enhancement. the trial court imposed consecutive terms as to each of counts 2 and 3 as follows: one-third the middle term (one year), one-third the gun discharge enhancement (six years six months), and one-third the gang enhancement (three years three months), for a total as to each count of 10 years 9 months. both defendants filed timely notices of appeal. 2. prosecution evidence the robbery in the early evening of may 17, 2010, four young men, robert rodriguez (rodriguez), brothers moises (moises) and jesus pestana (jesus), and octavio tapia (tapia), stood conversing in front of an apartment building in lynwood. defendants 4 approached the four in a two-tone white lexus automobile with special rims, driven by a woman. as the car stopped near the four young men, one of the occupants asked where they were from. believing that defendants were asking about their gang affiliation, all four gave replies indicating that they were not gang members. defendants then emerged from the lexus and ordered the four to empty their pockets. when the four companions failed to comply immediately, frias told flores to pull who pointed it toward both moises and tapia. while frias pointed the gun both pocket and put them in his own pocket, while holding the gun. rodriguez took out a 99-cent store receipt, the only thing he had in his pocket; frias demanded the receipt but threw it on the ground after rodriguez gave it to him. rodriguez, tapia, moises, and jesus were all frightened during the brief incident. as they fled, frias fired the gun three times toward the apartment building, hitting the identification evidence rodriguez recognized defendants from school, although he had not seen them in -person photographic lineup (six-pack) three days after the robbery, but was unable to identify a photograph of flores. rodriguez identified both defendants in court as the perpetrators, and testified that he was certain. tapia also remembered defendants from school and recognized them as soon as they got out of the lexus. he selected both identified them later in court. moises selected frias from a photographic lineup, and identified both defendants in court. jesus testified that he had been too frightened to identify anyone in the photographic lineup, but he did identify both defendants in court as the perpetrators. 5 rodriguez told investigators that flores had tattoos on his neck and chest. at trial, rodriguez reviewed photographs of flores anand moises also testified that flores had tattoos on his head and neck, and moises hotograph. jesus testified that he saw a tattoo on los angeles county sheriff detective oscar veloz led the investigation in this case. from a liquor store security camera near the crime scene, detective veloz obtained a photograph of a white lexus passing around the time of the robbery. at trial, tapia, detective veloz located the car three weeks sheriff deputies executed a search warrant. the car was registered to roxanna sanchez, search. about two weeks after the robbery, detective veloz interviewed flores, who admitted that he belonged to the lynwood compitas gang, and that he was called lucky. gang evidence xpert. he was familiar with the compitas gang as he had investigated it for years as a patrol deputy and gang detective. he testified that the compitas gang was a criminal street gang with approximately 50 members, who regularly committed such crimes as petty theft, vandalism (marking territory), robberies, assaults, and murders, all of which were the showing that compitas gang member carlos jimenez (jimenez) was convicted in 2009 of two counts of robbery and one count of assault with a deadly weapon, and that compitas gang member fernando rios (rios) was convicted in 2008 of unlawful possession of a the compitas gang was territorial and considered several other gangs in the area as its rivals. detective sarti described the special significance that respect held in gang 6 on for violence for the benefit of the gang and noted that a gang member could earn greater respect by using a gun to commit his crime. detective sarti testified that gang members usually committed crimes in view of another gang member; and usually identified their gang so that word of the crimes would spread in the community and create fear. community fear of the gang was important because it discouraged people from reporting crimes and provided protection against incursions by rival gangs. a gang member could put in work by shooting a gun and yelling out the name of the gang. recorded their contact with a gang member, noting such information as the gang moniker, associates, and whether other gang members were with him at the time of the contact. detective sarti presented two such cards regarding flores, one dated may 13, 2010, indicating flores admitted his membership in the compitas gang. the other was prepared on may 17, 2010, when detective sarti and another deputy sheriff contacted flores while he was in the company of frias. flores admitted his gang affiliation to detective sarti. detective sarti also presented six cards regarding frias, prepared on dates ranging from march 4, 2008 to may 17, 2010. all six cards reflected that frias admitted his ad, and was a compitas gang member, that lwd stood for lynwood, and cpts stood for compitas. detective sarti was familiar with frias and flores from several past contacts and 7 gang defendants were active members of the compitas gang at the time of the robbery. detective sarti explained that although gang members could give up their membership, such as by moving out of the area and never returning or associating with other gang members, one who committed robberies, yelled out his gang name, or shot a gun in the company of another gang member would be an active gang member, not a former gang member. in response to a hypothetical question tracking the facts in evidence, detective sarti expressed his opinion that the crimes were committed for the benefit of the compitas gang. although he based his opinion upon the totality of the circumstances, he found special significance in the commission of a violent crime, the identification of 3. defense evidence gregorio estevane (estevane) testified as the defense gang expert. estevane testified regarding his knowledge of gang culture and gave his opinion that like the majority of crimes committed by gang members, the crimes charged in this case were personal, not committed for the benefit of the gang. he based this opinion on the fact there was no evidence that the crimes were directed or planned by the gang leadership, no one was killed, the items stolen had little value, and the crimes were unlikely to cause fear of the gang in the community. estevane also testified that the number one rule of gang culture, under threat of death, was that gang members did not admit their membership to law enforcement or communicate with the police. he also described the california gang database as a method by which law enforcement kept track of suspected gang members by inputting both reliable and unreliable information. estevane further testified that a gang member could leave the gang but still live in the neighborhood, and er active members of the gang. 8 hailly korman (korman), a lawyer and former elementary school teacher, testified that she had known frias since he was 12 years old. in 2009, frias, his girlfriend and son man helped him find a job and paid his tuition at los angeles trade tech college. korman did not know frias to be a kname, casper, was gang related, and claimed that his brothers had called him that because he had alopecia, which caused raymond, who was killed two years before. discussion i. substantial identification evidence defendants contend the identification evidence was too unreliable to constitute substantial evidence and thus failed to establish their identity as the perpetrators. they base their contention on three major points: each witness gave inconsistent testimony; procedure followed by detective veloz in obtaining photographic identifications was flawed. tress and fear, flores cites several articles of behavioral studies and identification procedures, and asks that we reevaluate the present the testimony of an identification expert at trial, and there is no record of the submission of such studies and articles in the trial court. also, flores did not object to the procedures followed by detective veloz. thus, the record is not sufficiently developed to permit application of the points urged by flores to this case. flores has failed to adequately preserve the identification issues for review. (people v. cunningham (2001) 25 cal.4th 926, 989.) t eyewitness testimony cannot constitute substantial evidence where witnesses were fearful and stressed, forgetful of some details and mistaken about others, and where the trial 9 court did not, on its own motion, require the prosecution to establish that specific procedures were followed. we must apply the usual substantial evidence test of people v. johnson (1980) 26 cal.3d 557, and jackson v. virginia (1979) 443 u.s. 307, to eyewitness identification. (people v. cuevas (1995) 12 cal.4th 252, 274-275, 277.) inconsistent to constitute substantial evidence. defendants provide a summary of the conflicts and weaknesses in the testimony of the victims and contend that their inconsistent testimony did not constitute substantial evidence. for example, defendants point to testimony and statements to investigators in which one or more of the witnesses -the--the-failed to tell investigators that they recognized the two assailants, but so testified at trial; failed to select a photograph from the photographic lineup, while thereafter identifying defendants with certainty at trial; and failed to remember which defendant had a tattoo on his neck. as respondent observes, we do not reweigh the evidence or resolve conflicts in the evidence. (people v. young (2005) 34 cal.4th 1149, 1181.) review the whole record in the light most favorable to the judgment below to determine whether it discloses substantial evidence -- that is, evidence which is reasonable, credible, and of solid value - such that a reasonable trier of fact could find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable people v. johnson, supra, 26 cal.3d at p. 578; see also jackson v. virginia, supra, 443 u.s. at pp. 318-319.) knesses and inconsistencies in eyewitness testimony are matters solely for people v. allen (1985) 165 cal.app.3d 616, 623.)2 2 flores acknowledges that the trial court thoroughly instructed the jury with calcrim no. 315, listing 15 questions jurors must consider in evaluating identification testimony. and as respondent observes, defense counsel extensively cross-examined the 10 eyewitrejection of the statements given by a witness who has been believed by a trial court, there must exist either a physical impossibility that they are true, or their falsity must be apparent without resorting to inferences or deductions. [citations.] conflicts and even testimony which is subject to justifiable suspicion do not justify the reversal of a judgment, for it is the exclusive province of the trial judge or jury to determine the credibility of a witness and the truth or falsity of the facts upon which a determination ibid.; see also people v. young, supra, 34 cal.4th at p. 1181.) we thus decline to second-inconsistencies, or reevaluate the evidence due to weaknesses cited by defendants. regardless, we find that defrodriguez and moises all three victims identified both defendants in court. tapia also identified defendants in court and prior to seeing them in court, by selecting their photographs from a photographic lineup three days after defendants were physically impossible or inherently improbable, his testimony alone provides . (see in re gustavo m. (1989) 214 cal.app.3d 1485, 1497; people v. allen, supra, 165 cal.app.3d at p. 623.) in addition, the identification evidence was not weak simply because there were conflicts. as detective veloz explained, when there are multiple victims and multiple recollections were remarkably consistent and similar in important details. all witnesses saw a witnesses and detailed the conflicts and weaknesses of their identification testimony at length in summation. 11 tattoo instead. deputy angel banuelos testified that when he interviewed the victims shortly after the robbery, rodriguez, moises, and jesus reported seeing a tattoo on florinherent improbability, such circumstances support the witnesses in-court identifications. further, the evidence against frias was overwhelming, and the evidence that flores was his coperpetrator was also very strong. as respondent notes, frias was uniquely identifiable by his lack of eyebrows. the robbery was committed by at least one compitas gang member and both frias and flores were active compitas gang the robb having reviewed the entire record, we conclude that substantial evidence supported the identification of flores and frias as the robbers, such that a reasonable jury could find them guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. (see people v. johnson, supra, 26 cal.3d at p. 578; people v. allen, supra, 165 cal.app.3d at p. 623.) ii. substantial evidence supported the robbery flores contends that his conviction for the robbery of rodriguez was not supported by substantial evidence. flores argues that the evidence was insufficient to establish the -cent store receipt taken from rodriguez had insufficient value. roperty in the possession of another, from his person or immediate presence, and against his will, accomplished by means of slight (see people v. simmons (1946) 28 cal.2d 699, 705), but he contends that the prosecution was required to prove that the property had some without regard to the value of the proppeople v. tafoya (2007) 42 cal.4th 147, 170; see also people v. clark (2011) 52 cal.4th 856, 943.) 12 substantial evidence supports the other elements of robbery, and flores does not argue otherwise. flores handed frias a gun which frias held while demanding the people v. burney (2009) 47 cal.4th 203, 251.) because rodriguez was frightened by the gun, he complied with the demand by taking the receipt from his pocket which frias then took from him. his will by means of both force and fear. the elements of robbery were thus established, and the value of the receipt is of no consequence. (people v. tafoya, supra, 42 cal.4th at p. 170; see also people v. clark, supra, 52 cal.4th at p. 943.) iii. no evidence of an inattentive juror defendants contend that juror no. 1 fell asleep twice during the trial. flores contends that the trial court was required to conduct a sua sponte inquiry into whether juror no. 1 was paying adequate attention. a juror who is found to be unable to perform his or her duties may be discharged. ood cause to discharge a juror may determine whether the juror should be discharged. [citation.] . . . [h]owever, . . . the require a formal hearing disrupting the possibility of juror bias, incompetence, or misconduct -- like the ultimate decision to retain or discharge a juror -- rests within the sound discretion of the trial court. [citation.] the court does not abuse its discretion simply because it fails to investigate is required only where the court possesses information which, if proved to be true, would people v. bradford (1997) 15 cal.4th 1229, 1348.) 13 give a reason for questioning the juror and no further mention was made of the incident at that time. as defendants did not request further inquiry and no declarations were submitted in support of the motions for new trial, it remains unknown whether the juror was asleep or if he was asleep, whether his condition was more than momentary. s representations else that would indicate that juror no. 1 was not paying attention or evaluating the evidence. here. the only evidence require the court to conduct further inquiry. (people v. espinoza (1992) 3 cal.4th 806, sleeping (people v. desantis (1992) 2 cal.4th 1198, 1234), or when the evidence does not show that the sleeping continued for a significant period. (people v. bradford, supra, 15 cal.4th at pp. 1348-1349.) the federal cases on which flores relies do not hold otherwise. (e.g., united states v. springfield (9th cir. 1987) 829 f.2d 860 (springfield); united states v. barrett (9th cir. 1983) 703 f.2d 1076 (barrett); united states v. hendrix (9th cir. 1977) 549 f.2d 1225.) nor do the cases hold, as flores claims, that a trial judge may not take judicial notice that a juror was not asleep during the trial. only barrett discussed the issue. there, the federal appeals court merely held that under the particular circumstances of that case, where a juror admitted sleeping during trial and asked to be removed, the trial judge was required to investigate further and could not take judicial notice contrary to the evidence. (barrett, supra, at pp. 1082-1083.) here by contrast, there was no evidence that juror no. 1 was sleeping. thus the trial court did not abuse its 14 discretion in making no inquiry. (see people v. bradford, supra, 15 cal.4th at p. 1351; people v. espinoza, supra, 3 cal.4th at p. 821.) moreover, if the juror had fallen asleep just before the trial court spoke to him, there could be no harm to either defendant. the prosecutor was questioning tapia about the photographic lineup. just before the judge spoke to the juror, tapia had authenticated his initials on the six-pack of photographs, as well as the admonishment attached to it, and confirmed that he had circled photograph no. 1. even if the juror missed this authentication, it is clear from the record that the juror was awake when tapia testified that he wrote on the six-[sicauthentiafter the robbery, and then identified flores in court. -of-court photographic identification of frias did not conflict with his in-court identification. assuming juror no. 1 had a moment of inattention, whatever the reason, it clearly did not cause him to in-court identification was sufficient by itself to sustain the conviction. (in re gustavo m., supra, 214 cal.app.3d at p. 1497.) iv. substantial evidence of gang allegation defendants contend that the gang finding under section 186.22, subdivision (b)(1), was unsupported by substantial evidence. in particular, flores contends that the evidence of a pattern of criminal activity was insufficient to establish that compitas was a criminal finding function. flores also contends that the california supreme court enunciated a new evidentiary standard to review gang findings and that its application here would violate the ex post facto clause of the united states constitution. a gang finding is reviewed under the same substantial evidence standard as any other conviction. (people v. ochoa (2009) 179 cal.app.4th 650, 657 (ochoa).) we 15 in support of the judgment the existence of every fact the jury could reasonably deduce -- that is, evidence that is reasonable, credible, and of solid value -- from which a reasonable trier of fact could find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. people v. albillar (2010) 51 cal.4th 47, 59-60 (albillar).) a gang finding has two prongs: (1) the crime was committed for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with any criminal street gang; and (2) the crime was committed with the specific intent to promote, further, or assist in any criminal conduct by gang members. (people v. villalobos (2006) 145 cal.app.4th 310, 322 (villalobos); see albillar, supra, 51 cal.4th at pp. 67-68;  186.22, subd. (b).) the jury may reasonably infer the association element of the first prong from the very fact that the defendant committed the charged crime with another gang member, unless there is evidence that the gang (people v. morales (2003) 112 cal.app.4th 1176, 1198 (morales); see also albillar, at pp. 61-62, 67-68.) a. expert testimony established a pattern of criminal activity means any ongoing organization, association, or group of three or more persons, whether formal or informal, having as one of its primary activities the commission of one or more [enumerated] criminal acts, . . . having a common name or common identifying sign or symbol, and whose members individually ( two or more of the [predicate] offenses . . . committed on separate occasions, by two or 186.22, subd. (e); see also people v. gardeley (1996) 14 cal.4th 605, 616, 620-621 (gardeley).) the predicate offenses need not be gang related. (gardeley, at p. 621.) currently charged offenses will qualify as predicate offenses if committed with a gang member. (people v. loeun (1997) 17 cal.4th 1, 5, 8-9.) 16 gang or its common identifying sign or symbol. he concedes that assault with a deadly weapon and unlawful possession of a firearm, the crimes committed by jimenez and rios, were among the offenses enumerated in subdivision (e) of section 186.22, and that they were adequately proven. flores contends that the evidentiary insufficiency was was based upon the hearsay admissions of the two men, made to detective sarti and other deputies. fwith regard to gang membership. defendants did not raise either objection in the trial court. a defendant may not make a hearsay objection or challenge the lack of foundation for the first time on appeal. (people v. dennis for the first time on appeal. (people v. zepeda (2001) 87 cal.app.4th 1183, 1208.) further, as defendants did not raise any objectioexpert at trial, they may not do so here. (people v. gonzalez (2006) 38 cal.4th 932, 948 (gonzalezdiscretion. (people v. williams (1997) 16 cal.4th 153, 196-197.) it is axiomatic that the trial court cannot be found to have abused discretion it was never asked to exercise. (people v. burns (1987) 196 cal.app.3d 1440, 1455.) thus, as neither defendant qualifications or moved to exclude his opinion or his testimony regarding the predicate offenses and the membership status of jimenez and rios, we need not address those issues. moreover, the contentions have no merit. it is well settled that a gang expert may information is reliable. (gonzalez, supra, 38 cal.4th at p. 949; gardeley, supra, 14 cal.4th at p. 618; people v. hill (2011) 191 cal.app.4th 1104, 1121-1123 (hill).) thus, a gang expert may rely on admissions by gang members, as well as information obtained from colleagues and other law enforcement agencies. (gonzalez, at p. 949; people v. olguin (1994) 31 cal.app.4th 1355, 1370.) 17 reliability may be apparenconducting investigations of gang members and the use of multiple sources of information. (gonzalez, supra, 38 cal.4th at p. 949.) reliability was established here in nion that jimenez was a compitas gang member admission to the detective himself. detective sarti had personally arrested rios on the predicate offense of unlawful possession of a firearm, and rios admitted to him that he was an active compitas gang member. detective sarti had been a deputy sheriff for 13 years with extensive experience with gangs in general and the compitas gang in particular. we find no abuse of discretion. substantial evidence established that the predicate crimes were committed by members of the compitas gang. defendants further contend that the evidence was insufficient to prove that they and frias were members of the compitas gang, criticizing the methodology used by law enforcement in identifying gang membership, which he describes as highly subjective and unverifiable. overall methodology to be reliable. (hill, supra, 191 cal.app.4th at pp. 1123-1124.) a ffense gang related so long as there people v. galvez (2011) 195 cal.app.4th 1253, 1261.) opinion, supported by the field identification cards admitted into evidence without objection. detective sarti presented two field identification cards prepared in may 2010, -admission of his membership in the compitas gang, including one time when detective sarti was present. this was the same occasion where frias was also present and also admitted his gang membership, which confirmed that each defendant 18 knew the gang membership of the other. detective sarti also presented five other field identification cards regarding frias, from 2008-2010, reflecting that frias admitted his membership in the compitas gang. in addition, detective sarti was personally familiar defendants were active members of the compitas gang at the time of this robbery was amply supported by the evidence. g membership because there were no arrests or descriptions of criminal activity on the cards. flores also contends that both internally and with other evidence, as well as with testimony given by the defense evidentiary conflicts. it was for the jury to evaluate the opinions of the experts, assign appropriate weight, resolve conflicts, and to accept or reject all or part of the opinions. ( 1127b; people v. bean (1988) 46 cal.3d 919, 933; people v. gentry (1968) 257 cal.app.2d 607, 611-612.) expert opinion is a form of circumstantial evidence. (people v. gentry, at p. 611.) a finding supported by substantial evidence will not be set aside merely because the circumstances might also be reasonably reconciled with a contrary finding. (people v. kraft (2000) 23 cal.4th 978, 1053-1054.) in sum, substantial evidence supported a finding that each defendant was a member of the compitas gang when they committed the robberies together and knew that the other defendant was a gang member. the second prong of the gang enhancement was thus established, and the jury could reasonably infer from the same evidence that the crimes were committed in association with the gang. (see albillar, supra, 51 cal.4th at pp. 62, 68;  186.22, subd. (b).) further, substantial evidence demonstrated that defendants committed the crimes by actively assisting each other in such a way that would benefit the gang. detective sarti testified that putting in work for the gang included shooting and identifying the gang, thus benefitting the gang by creating fear in the community to discourage people from reporting crimes and provide protection against 19 rival gangs. here one defendant fired a weapon and one or both of them yelled, statute. ( 186.22, subd. (b); see albillar, at pp. 61-62, 67-68; villalobos, supra, 145 cal.app.4th at p. 322; morales, supra, 112 cal.app.4th at p. 1198.) c. conflicting inferences do not render the evidence insubstantial with no analysis, frias contends that the jury could have inferred that the crimes were committed for his personal benefit because it was not established which defendant supported by subthe circumstances might also reasonably be reconciled with a contrary finding does not warrant a reversal of the people v. thomas (1992) 2 cal.4th 489, 514.) d. no ex post facto violation flores contends that in albillar, supra, 51 cal.4th 47, the california supreme court lowered the evidentiary standard in a newly enunciated construction of section 186.22, subdivision (b).3 flores further contends that application of the new standard here would violate the ex post facto clause of the united states constitution. quoting beazell v. ohio (1925) 269 u.s. 167, flores argues that we should not follow albillar and tatute which punishes as a crime an act previously committed, which was innocent when done; which makes more burdensome the punishment for a crime, after its commission, or which deprives one charged with crime of any defense available according to law at the time when the act was committed, is prohibited as ex post factobeazell v. ohio, supra, at pp. 169-170.) although flores fails to describe an alleged newly enunciated crime or punishment, he is apparently challenging the rule that a reasonable inference that the 3 finding may b 20 crimes were committed in association with the gang (first prong) may be drawn from evidence that the defendant committed the crime with a known gang member (second prong). (see albillar, supra, 51 cal.4th at pp. 62, 68;  186.22, subd. (b).) flores argues albillar opinion in albillar in which she described the majority interpretation as creating a subdivision (b) . . . with the requirement of the first pronalbillar, supra, at p. 73 (conc. & dis. opn. of werdegar, j.).) the inference criticized by flores and justice werdegar was not newly enunciated in albillar. appellate courts have drawn such an inference before albillar was published and before defendants committed the current crimes in 2010. (e.g., ochoa, supra, 179 cal.app.4th at p. 661, fn. 7; people v. leon (2008) 161 cal.app.4th 149, 162; people v. martinez (2008) 158 cal.app.4th 1324, 1332; morales, supra, 112 cal.app.4th at p. 1198.) -- people v. leon, at p. 163; morales, at p. 1198.) as our supreme court did not create a new crime or punishment in albillar, and no ex post facto violation occurred here (see beazell v. ohio, supra, 269 u.s. at pp. 169-170), we are not relieved from the requirement of following albillar. (see auto equity sales, inc. v. superior court (1962) 57 cal.2d 450 (auto equity sales).) flores contends that the evidence was insufficient because detective sarti drew inferences in his testimony that should have been left to the jury. detective sarti testified about gang culture and gave opinions based upon his settled that expert testimony about gang culture and habits is the type of evidence a jury may rely on to reach a verdict on a gang-related offense or a finding on a gang allegation. 21 people v. ferraez (2003) 112 cal.app.4th 925, 930.) moreover, expert opinion may consist of inferences and conclusions that cannot be easily drawn by persons without specialized knowledge. (see people v. torres (1995) 33 cal.app.4th 37, 45; evid. code,  801.) an expert may render an opinion based upon a hypothetical question, so long as the question is based upon facts shown by the evidence. (gardeley, supra, 14 cal.4th at p. 618.) flores does not clearly set out the challenged inferences or show that they should have been left to the jury to draw, nor does he refer to the pages in the record where they might be found. flores merely cto intimidate, and he opined that [defendants] were compitas gang members and that the crimes they committed were insufficiently developed to permit any reasoned discussion of it, and we reject it on that basis. (see people v. turner (1994) 8 cal.4th 137, 214, fn. 19.) v. no abuse of discretion in spectator identification flores contends that the trial court erred by overruling his objection under spectators was a compitas gang member. flores contends that detective sarttheir fear of testifying, as well as with an earlier incident in which deputies spoke to several courtroom spectators as a matter of courtroom security (court security incident). he argues that the combination of these circumstances rendered his trial unfair and resulted in a denial of due process.4 4 a decision made under the ordinary rules of evidence does not ordinarily implicate constitutional rights. (people v. dement (2011) 53 cal.4th 1, 52.) as flores did not make a constitutional argument below, we do not reach his due process claim unless and until he establishes error under state law. (people v. thornton (2007) 41 cal.4th 391, 443-444; people v. partida (2005) 37 cal.4th 428, 435-439.) 22 discretion may exclude evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the probability that its admission will . . . create substantial danger of undue prejudice . . . a trial court has broad discretion in determining whether to admit or exclude evidence objected to on the basis of this section. (people v. anderson (2001) 25 cal.4th 543, 591.) capricious or patently absurd manner that resulted in a manifest miscarriage of justice. [citapeople v. rodrigues (1994) 8 cal.4th 1060, 1124-1125 (rodrigues).) initially we observe that defendants did not object under evidence code section identification incident. defense counsel objected as leading to the following question the them . . . to the question as calling for speculation. not only were there no objections based on witness is afraid to testify or fears retaliation for testifying is relevant to the credibility of that witness and is therefore admissible. [citations.] an explanation of the basis for the people v. burgener (2003) 29 cal.4th 833, 869; evid. code,  780.) flores does not contend that the testimony was erroneously admitted over his objections made on speculation and leading grounds. the court security incident occurred when defense counsel complained that -in-law, in the hallway within view of the jury, and that detective sarti had spoken to a member of the identifications were inflammatory and asked it to prohibit random searches of persons in 23 identify persons entering the courtrooms.5 the prosecutor then informed the court that there were members of the compitas gang in the audience and that she intended to ask trial court noted the objection, but did not rule. larobert fuentes as a compitas gang member, he stated the grounds as prejudicial and irrelevant under evidence code section 352, but did not ask the court to weigh its probative value against the combined prejudicial effect of the identification, the evidence objection to evidence should be stated so as to make clear the specific ground of the objection. (evid. code,  353.) this means that an objection must be stated with necessary, for the trial court to determine the question intelligently, and for the appellate people v. ramos (1997) 15 cal.4th 1133, 1172.) in essence, flores seeks review of a decision he never asked the trial court to make. we agree with respondent that the trial court did not abuse the discretion that it opinion, particularly since frias had just presented the testimony of defense gang expert, estevane, which conflicted in many key respects with the testimony of detective sarti. in addition, we agree with respondent that the identification of the spectator as a gang member was relevant to the assessment of the witnesses who testified that they were in fear of retaliation. rodriguez testified that defendants were gang members which frightened him during the robbery; he felt the same fear while testifying. tapia was 5 the trial court offered three times to admonish the jury, but neither defense counsel accepted the offer. 24 ght shoot him or come after his family. it is people v. sapp (2003) 31 cal.4th 240, 281, quoting people v. olguin, supra, 31 cal.app.4th at p. 1368.) we conclude that defendant has failed to show that the trial court abused its discretion or that his due process rights were violated. (see people v. thornton, supra, 41 cal.4th at pp. 443-444.) reliance on hearsay appropriate excluded in its entirety as violating the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment to the united states constitution. flores contends that detectisixth amendment grounds in the trial court, he now relies on crawford v. washington (2004) 541 u.s. 36, in which the united states supreme court held that the sixth appear at trial unless he was unavailable to testify, and the defendant had had a prior opportunity for cross-id. at pp. 53-54, 68.) a failure to raise a confrontation clause claim in the trial court forfeits the issue on appeal. (people v. redd (2010) 48 cal.4th 691, 730.) flores contends that his failure to raise the claim below should be excused because any such objection would have been gardeley, supra, 14 cal.4th at page 618, that an expert may base an opinion on inadmissible hearsay so long as the information is reliable. we agree that the trial court would have considered itself bound by gardeley under the doctrine of stare decisis -- as do we. (see auto equity sales, supra, 57 cal.2d at p. 455.) thus, had flores not forfeited the issue we would nevertheless reject post-crawford challenges to gardeley on the same basis (e.g., hill, 25 supra, 191 cal.app.4th at p. 1128; people v. ramirez (2007) 153 cal.app.4th 1422, 1426-1427; people v. thomas (2005) 130 cal.app.4th 1202, 1208-1210.) won evidence code section 352 in the trial court forfeits such a challenge. (people v. zapien (1993) 4 cal.4th 929, 979-980.) flores concedes that judicial discretion under evidence code section 352 has always been available to limit the prejudicial effect of the gardeley, supra, 14 cal.4th at p. 619) but contends that his failure to object should be excused in order to consider the new approach recently suggested in people v. archuleta (2011) 202 cal.app.4th 493, review granted march 28, 2012, s199979. we decline the request as the california supreme court has granted review in that case and it may no longer be cited. (cal. rules of court, rule 8.1105(e)(1).) failure to object to the hearsay evidence on which the gang expert relied in forming his opinion, thus depriving flores of effective assistance of counsel as guaranteed by the sixth amendment to the united states constitution and the california constitution, article i, section 15. flores concedes that any such objection would have been futile. (people v. price (1991) 1 cal.4th 324, 386-387.) vii. substantial evidence supports firearm allegation flores contends that the junot supported by substantial evidence because the evidence showed at most that he was merely armed with a firearm. he thus concludes that the 10-year sentence enhancement imposed must be stricken. section 12022.53, subdivision (c), provides for a 20-year sentence enhancement for personally and intentionally discharging a firearm in the commission of a robbery or other specified felony. that enhancement must be imposed upon any other principal in the robbery if that person falls within section 186.22, subdivision (b), provided that, 26 under such a circumstance, the gang enhancement shall not also be imposed on a defendant who did not personally use a firearm during the commission of the robbery. ( 12022.53, subd. (e).) having a firearm available for use. (people v. bland (1995) 10 cal.4th 991, 997.) on the n a bare potential for use, there need not be conduct which actually produces harm but only conduct which produces a fear of harm or force by means or display of a firearm in ibid.) whether defendant used a firearm or was merely armed, presents a question of fact for the jury. (people v. masbruch (1996) 13 cal.4th 1001, 1007.) we apply the usual substantial evidence standard to review the sufficiency of the evidence to support a firearm enhancement, presuming every fact the jury could reasonably have deduced from the evidence. (people v. wilson (2008) 44 cal.4th 758, 806 (wilson).) flores contends that the evidence showed that he merely passed the gun to frias without intentionally pointing it at the victims. however, the prosecution was not required to prove that he pointed the gun or used it to expressly threaten any of the victims. (wilson, suprashows a gun, or otherwise makes its presence known, and there is no evidence to suggest any purpose other than intimidating the victim (or others) so as to successfully complete the underlying offense, the jury is entitled to find a facilitative use rather than an incidental or inadvertent exposure. the defense may freely urge the jury not to draw such an inference, but a failure to actually point the gun, or to issue explicit threats of ibid.; see also people v. bryant (2011) 191 cal.app.4th 1457, 1472.) thus flores is mistaken in his suggestion that the evidence was insufficient without proof that he pointed the gun. moreover, flores is mistaken in his facts. tapia 27 at moises before passing it to frias. testimony by stating that it was frias who pointed the gun at him and moises. we disagree. tapia clarified his testimony, but he did not change it. tapia identified frias as the defendant wearing green and flores as the defendant wearing black. he testified that took it out, and he was just holding it [and] pointiwith the green sweater took the gun from the guy, and he just walked up to us, and pointed it at both . . . further, as soon as frias took the gun, frias pointed the gun while both defendants pocket; the initial display of the weapon, followed immediately by the demand and search after passing the gun to frias, was sufficient. (see wilson, supra, 44 cal.4th at p. 807.) thus substantial evidence showed that flores deliberately made the presence of the gun known for the purpose of intimidating the victims into handing over their possessions. we conclude from such circumstances that substantial evidence sfinding that flores personally used a firearm in the commission of the robbery, and thus the enhancement was proper. viii. no abuse of discretion in imposing upper, consecutive, and enhanced terms defendants contend that the trial court abused its sentencing discretion by not striking gang enhancements and by imposing the terms consecutively. in addition, flores contends that the trial court applied improper and duplicate aggravating factors to impose upper terms; abused its discretion by sentencing him as a second strike offender; and improperly imposed multiple gang enhancements. 28 as flores did not raise these issues in the trial court he has failed to preserve them for review. (people v. gonzalez (2003) 31 cal.4th 745, 755; people v. scott (1994) 9 cal.4th 331, 356.) he contends, however, that trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance of counsel due to his failure to raise the issues in the trial court. with the exception of three undeveloped issues, we reach them only to counteof ineffective counsel. (rodrigues, supra, 8 cal.4th at pp. 1125-1126.) r, except in relation to the gang enhancements. as respondent notes, consecutive sentences were appropriate as there were several victims. (see people v. calhoun (2007) 40 cal.4th 398, 408; people v. leon (2010) 181 cal.app.4th 452, 468.) in addition, without analysis, flores contends that the imposition of multiple enhancements violated the protection against double jeopardy afforded by the united states constitution. as flores makes no attempt to show that the enhancements imposed here define offenses that are subject to double jeopardy (see people v. izaguirre (2007) 42 cal.4th 126, 130-134), we do not address this contention. two other issues are insufficiently developed to warrant discussion. (see people v. medrano (2008) 161 cal.app.4th 1514, 1520.) flores also contends that his trial counsel rendered constitutionally ineffective romeropeople v. superior court (romero) 13 cal.4th 497.) however, he does not attempt to show that such a motion might have had merit, as he must to obtain a reversal on this ground. (see strickland v. washington (1984) 466 u.s. 668, 694; rodrigues, supra, 8 cal.4th at p. 1126.) in reviewing the remaining issues, we presume that the trial court acted to achieve legitimate sentencing objectives, and thus its sentencing choice is reviewed for abuse of discretion. (people v. jones (2009) 178 cal.app.4th 853, 859-860; people v. lamb (1988) 206 cal.app.3d 397, 401 (lambon appeal unless the party attacking the sentence clearly shows that the sentencing 29 people v. jones, supra, at pp. 860 -861, quoting people v. carmony (2004) 33 cal.4th 367, 377.) a . upper terms were properly imposed flores contends that the trial court applied improper aggravating factors to impose the upper term as to count 1. the trial court sentenced flores to the high term of five years in prison due a sentencing court has broad discretion to impose the lower, middle, or upper terms of imprisonment, and to weigh various aggravating and mitigating factors. (people v. black (2007) 41 cal.4th 799, 813, 822; lamb, supra, 206 cal.app.3d at p. 401;  1170, subd. (b).) the court may consider the factors set forth in the california rules of court, so long as the same fact is not used to aggravate a term and impose an enhancement. ( 1170, subd. (b); cal. rules of court, rules 4.408(a), 4.420(b).) a single aggravating factor will justify the imposition of the upper term. (people v. osband (1996) 13 cal.4th 622, 728.) a finding that the victim was particularly vulnerable will justify the upper term. reater than in other cases. vulnerability means defenseless, unguarded, unprotected, accessible, assailable, one who people v. smith (1979) 94 cal.app.3d 433, 436.) here the trial court found the victims particularly vulnerable based upon its observations of the victims while testifying, concluding that defendants chose obviously 6 diately placed them in fear for their lives flores contends that the victims were not particularly vulnerable because they or 6 the record reflects that at least one victim, moises, was a minor. 30 cases, flores cites cases involving an isolated rape victim (people v. burrell-hart (1987) 192 cal.app.3d 593, 601), a sleeping victim (people v. loudermilk (1987) 195 cal.app.3d 996, 1007), children at a daycare center (people v. hetherington (1984) 154 cal.app.3d 1132, 1141-1142), and spousal trust (people v. clark (1990) 50 cal.3d 583, 638). targeting teenage boys fearful of gangs may not compare to targeting children at a daycare center, but we cannot conclude that the use of this factor was arbitrary or capricious. moreover, the second factor challenged by flores was clearly proper. flores convictions or sustained juvenile delinquency petitions were of increasing seriousness. (see cal. rules of court, rule 4.421(b)(2).) however, he contends that the evidence did and vandalism were not increasingly serious. we disagree. as flores points out, the trial court could not properly consider the prior robbery conviction, as it was used to impose a second strike term. (see  1170, subd. (b).) however, the trial court was entitled to consider his current crimes. (see people v. thompson (1990) 222 cal.app.3d 1647, 1652.) thus, as the trial court properly found thaescalated to robbing the three victims in this case, the imposition of the upper term under this circumstance was not an abuse of discretion. b. multiple gang enhancements were justified by multiple victims flores contends that the trial court erred in failing to apply section 654. relying on neal v. state (1960) 55 cal.2d 11, 19 (neal), flores argues that only one gang enhancement may be imposed because the robbery of the three victims was a single, indivisible course of conduct, each undertaken with the single intent of an objective of acting for the benefit or at the direction of, or in association with his gang. respondent 31 contends that the multiple victim exception is applicable here.7 (see people v. oates (2004) 32 cal.4th 1048, 1063-1064 (oates).) law shall be punished under the provision that provides for the longest potential term of imprisonment, but in no case shall the act or omission be punished under more than one section 654 is applicable to enhancements that go to the people v. ahmed (2011) 53 cal.4th 156, 162-163.) section 654 does not apply to crimes of violence against multiple victims. (people v. correa (2012) 54 cal.4th 331, 343 (correa).) the multiple victim exception is applicable to a single act of violence committed against multiple victims, even when the defendant harbored the same intent and objective. (oates, supra, 32 cal.4th at pp. 1063-1064.) robbery is a violent crime. (people v. hall (2000) 83 cal.app.4th 1084, 1090.) when section 654 applies to enhancements, the multiple victim exception is also applicable, so long as neither the enhancement statute nor its legislative history suggests a punishment purposes thaoates, supra, 32 cal.4th at p. 1066, quoting people v. king (1993) 5 cal.4th 59, 78.) no such intent appears in the language of section 186.22, subdivision (b), which provides that convicted of a felony committed for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with any criminal street gang, with the specific intent to promote, 7 conspiracy law. (see  182.) section 182 and section 186.22, subdivision (b), are too dissimilar to permit comparison. (cf. in re alberto r. (1991) 235 cal.app.3d 1309, 1324 people v. mesa (2012) 54 cal.4th 191, in which the california supreme court held that section 654 prohibited punishment for both the crime of participation in a criminal street gang ( 186.22, subd. (a)), and assault with a firearm when both crimes were based upon shooting the victim. as neither the gang enhancement under section 186.22, subdivision (a), nor the multiple victim exception was at issue in the case, there is simply no analogy to be drawn. 32 further, or assist in any criminal conduct by gang members, shall, upon conviction of that felony . . statute does not call for the imposition of a single sentence enhancement upon a person who is convicted of a series of felonies with the same gang motive and intent. nor does legislative history indicate an intent to treat gang enhancements more restrictively, as the legislature intended to increase punishment in response to the terror and violence inflicted on the community by gang activity. (see people v. akins (1997) 56 cal.app.4th 331, 341 (akins).) relying on akins, flores contends that the multiple victim exception does not permit multiple gang enhancements unless the crimes of violence were distinct and separated by time and distance. akins did not involve one simultaneous robbery of several victims, as in this case. (see akins, supra, 56 cal.app.4th at pp. 339-340.) however, while not expressly naming the multiple victim exception, the court made clear that the result would have been no different had the robberies taken place at the same victims may be separately punished, even when they are for the same intent and during id. at pp. 340-341, citing people v. perez (1979) 23 cal.3d 545, 553.) the court concluded that section 654 was not applicable, and thus a separate gang enhancement was properly applied to each separate robbery despite a gang objective common to all. (akins, supra, at pp. 340-341.) a defendant who commits a violent crime against several victims is more culpable that a defendant who commits a violent crime against one person, regardless of his intent or objective. (oates, supra, 32 cal.4th at p. 1063.) the multiple victim exception prowith his culpability. (oates, at p. 1063.) likewise, multiple enhancements ensure that a defendant will not be treated less severely because he chooses to rob several victims to benefit his gang rather than just one victim. (cf. people v. king, supra, 5 cal.4th at pp. 73-74.) we conclude that where there were multiple victims, each robbery conviction is subject to a gang enhancement. 33 c. flores: no ineffective assistance of counsel flores contends that his trial counsel failed to render effective assistance as guaranteed by the united states and california constitutions because he failed to object (see u.s. const., 6th amend.; cal. const., art. i,  counsel. (strickland v. washington, supra, 466 u.s. at p. 687.) to meet that burden, he esentation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness; and (2) that there is a reasonable probability that, people v. rodrigues, supra, 8 cal.4th at p. 1126.) flores has made neither showing as wunmeritorious motion or objection is not ineffective assistance. (people v. price, supra, cal.4th at p. 387.) in addition, flores cannot show that the result would have been different had futile objections been made to the trial court. we thus reject the claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. d. frias: no abuse of discretion in consecutive sentencing or refusal to strike prior conviction8 frias contends that the trial court abused its discretion by imposing consecutive terms as to counts 2 and 3 because the crimes occurred as a single, continuous transaction with a common objective and goal, and lasted only a few minutes. first, frias sets forth california rules of court, rule 4.425, which suggests criteria for the trial court to 8 frias apparently anticipates an argument that section 12022.53, subdivision (c), precludes the court from imposing concurrent terms for the crimes underlying the enhancement. the trial court may run the underlying offense concurrently or consecutively, as long as the court treats the enhancement in the same manner. (cf. people v. phong bui (2011) 192 cal.app.4th 1002, 1016.) respondent does not contend otherwise. 34 consider when deciding whether to impose concurrent or consecutive terms.9 although frias demonstrates that the facts of this case do not fit any of the specific criteria, the rule provides that the trial court may base its decision on any other facts, with specified exceptions not claimed here. (see cal. rules of court, rule 4.425(b).) indeed, frias concedes that the trial court may properly rely on the fact that the crimes involved multiple victims. (see people v. shaw (2004) 122 cal.app.4th 453, 458-459.) as there were multiple victims in this case, we find no abuse of discretion. frias also contends that that trial court should have imposed the terms on all counts concurrently and should have stricken the gang enhancements. he reasons that were not seeking revenge against rival gang members [and] [t]he yelling of the gang name suggests that the court abused its discretion because current prison terms would be enough punishment in this case, as the amount to be served would still be a lengthy 38 years. punishment than had they robbed rival gang members. further, the jury found true beyond a reasonable doubt that the crimes were gang related, not that they were finding. finally, frias cites no authority to support the proposition that a sentence 9 sentences include: [] (a) . . . facts relating to the crimes, including whether or not: [] (1) the crimes and their objectives were predominantly independent of each other; [] (2) the crimes involved separate acts of violence or threats of violence; or [] (3) the crimes were committed at different times or separate places, rather than being committed so closely in time and place as to indicate a single period of aberrant behavior. [] (b) . . . any circumstances in aggravation or mitigation may be considered in deciding whether to impose consecutive rather than concurrent sentences, except: [] (1) a fact used to sentence; and [] (3) a fact that is an element of the crime may not be used to impose 35 constitutes an abuse of discretion simply because it is lengthy. we conclude that he has irrational or arbitrary. (see people v. carmony, supra, 33 cal.4th at p. 377.) frias also contends that consecutive sentences were an abuse of discretion because they resulted in a cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the eighth amendment to the united states constitution. we discuss that contention in the next section. ix. cruel or unusual punishment defendants contend that their sentences constitute cruel and unusual punishment under the eighth amendment to the united states constitution and cruel or unusual punishment under article i, section 17 of the california constitution. such claims must be made in the first instance in the trial court. (people v. burgener, supra, 29 cal.4th at pp. 886-887.) respondent contends that defendants have forfeited their constitutional claims by failing to raise them below. flores does not dispute his failure to raise the issue, but frias points out that he raised the issue in his sentencing memorandum. for convenience, we discuss both claims as both defendants incorporate the arguments of the other. as an initial matter, we note that defendants were 20-year-old adults at the time of their crimes. however defendants ask that we analyze the issue under both the california and united states constitutions as though they had been juveniles at the time, by applying the principles enunciated in graham v. florida (2010) 560 u.s. ___ [130 s.ct. 2011], in which the united states supreme court held that a sentence of life without parole (lwop) for any juvenile offender who did not commit a homicide is prohibited under the eighth amendment. defendants also invoke people v. mendez (2010) 188 who is not eligible for parole until beyond his life expectancy, currently 76 years for men, does not have a meaningful opportunity to obtain release. (id. at pp. 62-63; see also people v. caballero (2012) 55 cal.4th 262.) defendants were adults, and we decline their invitation to pretend otherwise. 36 a. california constitution under the california constitution, punishment is cruel or unusual if it is so disproportionate to the crime committed that it shocks the conscience and offends fundamental notions of human dignity. (people v. dillon (1983) 34 cal.3d 441 (dillon); in re lynch (1972) 8 cal.3d 410, 424 (lynch).) following dillon and lynch, california courts have developed three categories of review to determine whether a sentence is cruel degree of danger which both present to society; (2) a comparison of the challenged penalty with the punishment prescribed in the same jurisdiction for other more serious offenses; and (3) a comparison of the challenged penalty with the punishment prescribed for the same offense in other jurisdipeople v. mantanez (2002) 98 cal.app.4th 354, 359; lynch, supra, at pp. 425-428.) people v. weddle (1991) 1 cal.app.4th 1190, 1197.) we conclude that defendants have failed to carry their burdens. 1. flores with regard to his individual culpability flores argues that his youth and state of mind indicated a lesser degree of culpability. flores claidillon-year-old defendant with no criminal history, whose life sentence for murder was found to violate the california constitution in dillon, supra, 34 cal.3d at pages 487-488. flores contends that his 68-serious crime of murder because the parole eligibility period would be longer. with regard to state of mind, flores argues that the evidence failed to show that he intended that his codefendant fire the weapon or that either defendant intended to shoot anyone. such an argument falters on the facts: flores was an adult member of a criminal street gang when he committed three counts of robbery in association with his gang; he was carrying a loaded firearm, which he handed to his fellow gang member after pointing it at 37 one of his young victims; and he admitted that hardly more than one year before the current crimes, he was convicted of another robbery. disregards the question of recidivism, which must be taken into account in the analysis. (people v. gray people v. cartwright (1995) 39 cal.app.4th 1123, 1136-1137.) with regard to punishments in other jurisdictions, flores does not compare his sentence to those imposed elsewhere for the same offense. (see lynch, supra, 8 cal.3d at p. 427.) instead, he undertakes a comparison of minimum parole periods in other states, without regard to any particular offense, the enhancements, the number of offenses, or the punishment prescribed in other states under similar circumstances. not only is such a comparison lacking in helpfulness, flores once again disregards his recidivism. we conclude that flores has failed to overcome his burden in convincing us his sentence was disproportionate to his level of culpability as a violent recidivist. (see people v. weddle, supra, 1 cal.app.4th at p. 1197.) 2. frias apparently addressing the nature of the offense and the offender (see lynch, supra, 8 cal.3d at pp. 425-426), frias compares himself to juvenile offenders and quotes violent death, his near-illiteracy, and his efforts to improve himself. frias points out that in the statement he read to the court he apologized for his actions, claimed to have been intoxicated at the time of the robberies, and denied that the crimes were gang related. belief. the court expressly fouquestion whether a sentindividual culpability as to constitute cruel or unusual punishment is ultimately one of 38 (people v. mora (1995) 39 cal.app.4th 607, 615.) here, while purporting to acknowledge that his offenses were serious, frias in fact minimizes them by referring to the robberies as one offense, claiming that the victims were not injured because they were only frightened, claiming that the robbery was not attempt to minimize his own culpability and the circumstances of his crimes pays no meet his burden under the first dillon/lynch category. (people v. mantanez, supra, 98 cal.app.4th at p. 359.) dillon/lynch category fares no better. frias compares his sentence with various punishments prescribed in other jurisdictions. (see lynch, supra, 8 cal.3d at pp. 427-428.) however, he compares his sentence of 54 years against a single similar offense in other jurisdictions, not against three counts of robbery committed by an adult gang member in association with a criminal street gang, using a that does not take into account all offenses and circumstances that went into the defendandillon/lynch test. (people v. crooks (1997) 55 cal.app.4th 797, 808-809.) we conclude that frias has failed to overcome his burden in convincing us his sentence was disproportionate to his level of culpability. (see people v. weddle, supra, 1 cal.app.4th at p. 1197.) b. eighth amendment although the analysis under the federal constitution is similar to the analysis under the california constitution, the eighth amendment does not require an individualized proportionality review unless the punishment gives rise to an inference that it is grossly disproportionate to the crime. (harmelin v. michigan (1991) 501 u.s. 957, 995-996 (harmelin).) for adults, no such inference arises from a sentence of less than death. (ibid.) successful proportionality challenges to noncapital sentences are and 39 ewing v. california (2003) 538 u.s. 11, 22, quoting rummel v. estelle (1980) 445 u.s. 263, 374; see also harmelin, supra, at pp. 995-996, & 1001 (cohis punishment was cruel and unusual. (people v. wingo (1975) 14 cal.3d 169, 174.) defendants were adults and were sentenced to terms less than death. further, we have concluded that defendants failed to meet their burden to show that their punishment was so disproportionate to their crimes as to shock the conscience or offend fundamental notions of human dignity under the dillon/lynch test. (see lynch, supra, 8 cal.3d at p. 424; dillon, supra, 34 cal.3d at pp. 478-479.) thus, no inference of gross disproportionality arose. (harmelin, supra, 501 u.s. at pp. 995-effort to create such an inference is based solely upon the false premise that young adults that their punishment was cruel and unusual under the eighth amendment. (see people v. wingo, supra, 14 cal.3d at p. 174.) disposition the judgments are affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. _____________________________, j. chavez we concur: ______________________________, acting p. j. doi todd ______________________________, j. ashmann-gerst
