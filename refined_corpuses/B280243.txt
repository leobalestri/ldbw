(pen. code,  211.)1 we affirmed his conviction in a prior appeal. (people v. gammage (feb. 25, 2016, b256154) [nonpub. opn.].) appellant subsequently filed a nonstatutory motion for dna testing based on his constitutional rights to procedural due process and equal protection. the trial court denied the motion. we now affirm. factual and procedural background in 2014, appellant was convicted by jury of second degree robbery.2 the trial court suspended the imposition of sentence and placed appellant on three years of summary probation on the condition that he serve 365 days in county jail. appellant was released from jail on july 1, 2014. following his release from jail, appellant filed a motion for dna testing under section 1405, which the trial court denied on the ground that appellant was not then serving a term of imprisonment.3 in 1 unspecified statutory references are to the penal code. 2 they are not relevant to the issues on appeal. 3 of a felony and is currently serving a term of imprisonment may make a written motion . . . before the trial court that entered the judgment of conviction in his or her case, for performance of forensic deoxyribonucleic acid  1405, subd.

(to provide dna testing to someone in his position violates his rights to due process and equal protection. we therefore consider the merits of his appeal. 4 in osborne, the united states supreme court rejected the postconviction request under 42 united states code section 1983 for of a freestanding and far-reaching constitutional right of access to [dna testing] evidence.osborne, supra, 557 u.s. at pp. 5556.) following his conviction for kidnapping, assault, and sexual assault, osborne sought postconviction relief in alaska state court, seeking dna testing in reliance on a state postconviction statute and the federal and state constitutions. the supreme court reversed the holding of the federal appellate court that the due process clause extended the prosecutorial duty under brady v. maryland (1963) 373 u.s. 83, to disclose exculpatory evidence to postconviction proceedings. (osborne, supra, 557 u.s. at pp. 61-62.) the court acknowledged that postconviction, a defendant has liberty interest in demonstrating his innocence with new evidence osborne, supra, 557 u.s. at p. 68.) however, the court explained that criminal defendant proved guilty after a fair trial does not have the same liberty interests as a free man. . . . [] the state accordingly has more flexibility in deciding what procedures are needed in the context of postconviction relief. [w]hen a state chooses to offer help to those s due process does not dictat[e] the exact form such assistance must assume. . . . [] instead, the question is whether consideration of osbornes claim within the framework of the states procedures for postconviction relief offends some principle of justice so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental, or 5 transgresses any recognized principle of fundamental fairness in id. at pp. 68-69.) the court examined procedures for postconviction relief and found them to be constitutionally adequate. (id. at p. 69.) the court further rejected evidence. (id. at p. 72.) the supreme court accordingly has substantive due process to this area [of dna testing], [citation], and left slim room for the prisoner to show that the governing state law denies him procedural due process, [citatioskinner v. switzer (2011) 562 u.s. 521, 525.) unconstitutionality clearly, positively, and unmistakably appears; all (people v. hansel (1992) 1 cal.4th 1211, 1219.) although osborne recognized that a criminal defendant has a has the right to access dna testing. (osborne, supra, 557 u.s. at p. 68.) instead, the question is whether our state postconviction procedures fairness in osborne, supra, 557 u.s. at p. 69.) we find our procedures to be constitutionally adequate. 6 appellant has available to him the postconviction procedure of ly imprisoned or restrained of his or her liberty, under any pretense, may prosecute a writ of habeas corpus to inquire into the cause of his or her recent years has expanded the determined to be in constructive custody.people v. villa (2009) 45 cal.4th 1063, 1069.) the writ thus is available to someone like appellant, who is on probation. (ibid.) reasons for seeking a writ of habeas corpus include, but are not limited to, false material evidence and new evidence. ( 1473, subd. (b).) thus, [h]abeas corpus will lie to vindicate a claim that newly in re lawley (2008) 42 cal.4th 1231, 1238.) habeas corpus relief also may be sought on the ground that the prosecution did not disclose evidence.in re sassounian (1995) 9 cal.4th 535, 543; see also in re sodersten (2007) 146 cal.app.4th 1163, 1225-1236 [granting a petition for writ of habeas corpus based on a brady claim that the prosecution failed to disclose materially favorable evidence to the accused].) our state postconviction procedures thus allow a defendant on probation to seek relief based on a showing of actual innocence. . . [but] they are not (osborne, supra, 557 u.s. at p. 70.) 7 inadequate because it unfairly and arbitrarily limits access to dna ( 1405, subd. (a).) the decision to restrict access to dna testing to incarcerated persons is a legislative decision(people v. rodriguez (1998) 66 cal.app.4th 157, 175 (rodriguez).) in addressing whether the application of a penal statute violated substantive due process, the court in rodriguez explained legislature does not violate due process so long as an enactment is . . . reasonably related to a proper legislative goal. the wisdom of the legislation is not at issue in analyzing its constitutionality, and neither the availability of less drastic remedial alternatives nor the legislative failure to solve all related ills at [citation.] (ibid.) the legislative history of section 1405 indicates that the larceration. (california bill analysis, sen. bill no. 1342, 4/11/2000.) the senate committee per inmate . . . (ibid.) providing access to dna testing 1405, subd. (a)) is reasonably related to the legislative goals of both providing justice to innocent people and decreasing the costs of incarceration. (rodriguez, supra, 66 cal.app.4th at p. 175.) 8 as the supreme court explained in osborne, constitutional protection to an asserted right or liberty interest, we, to a great extent, place the matter outside the arena of public debate and legislative action. we must therefore exercise the utmost care [j]udicial imposition of a categorical remedy . . . might pretermit other responsible solutions being considered in congress and state legislatures.on.] . . . we are reluctant to enlist the . . . judiciary in creating a new constitutional code of rules for handling dnaosborne, supra, 557 u.s. at p. 73.) our state postconviction ess. ii. equal protection appellant further contends that his right to equal protection is violated. again, we disagree. the concept of equal protection recognizes that persons who are similarly situated with respect to a laws legitimate purposes must be treated equally. [citation.] accordingly, [t]he first prerequisite to a meritorious claim under the equal protection clause is a showing that the state has adopted a classification that affects two or more similarly situated inquiry is not whether persons are similarly situated for all purposes, (people v. brown (2012) 54 cal.4th 314, 328 (brown).) 9 denied the equal protection of the laws must coexist with the practical necessity that most legislation classifies for one purpose or another, with resulting disadvantage to various groups or persons. [citations.] we have attempted to reconcile the principle with the reality by stating that, if a law neither burdens a fundamental right nor targets a suspect class, we will uphold the legislative classification so long as it bears a romer v. evans (1996) 517 u.s. 620, 631; people v. parker (2006) 141 cal.app.4th 1297, classification such as race and does not infringe on a fundamental right, the legislative classification will be upheld whenever it has a rational relationship to a legitimate state interest. [citations.] this is true even if the law seems unwise or works to the disadvantage of a particular appellant, who was placed on probation, is not similarly situated to someone who is serving a term of imprisonment. among a variety of dispositional options. one option is to release the criminals whose conditional release into society poses minimal risk to tatively different from such traditional forms of punishment as fines or imprisonment. probation is neither 15) nor a criminal judgment (see  1445). instead, courts deem probation an act of clemency in lieu of punishment 10 [citationpeople v. moran (2016) 1 cal.5th 398, 402; see people v. mancebo probation is not punishment.) because appellant is not similarly situated to someone who is (brown, supra, 54 cal.4th at p. 328; see people v. valencia (2017) 3 cal.5th 347, 375-resentenced under proposition 36 are not similarly situated to those resentenced under proposition 47. these are two very different people v. jones (1985) 176 cal.app.3d 120, 128 [former probationers do not have the same status and, therefore, are not similarly situated with former state prisoners (and those discharged from parole) for purposes of ap.) even if he were similarly situated, as discussed above, the legislaturea rational basis for the decision to provide access to dna testing only to those serving a term of imprisonment. (see people v. martinez (2016) 5 cal.app.5th 234, 243 [unnecessary to decide whether persons convicted of certain forgeries are similarly situated to persons convicted of other ; people v. mendoza (2015) 241 cal.app.4th 764, 785 [no violation of 11 length of misdemeanor sentences, coupled with the heavy burdens on the justice system caused by large numbers of newly eligible defendants, provides the rational basis for refusing to extend the benefit of penal code section 1203.2a to county jail misdemea.) equal protection analysis does not entitle the judiciary to second-guess the wisdom, fairness, or logic of the law. [citation.] [] . . . relationship between the disparity of treatment and some legitimate conceivable state of facts that could provide a rational basis for the classifpeople v. turnage (2012) 55 cal.4th 62, 74.) the lincarcerated persons is reasonably related to its concern regarding the costs of incarceration. moreover, we agree with respondent that, because of the large numbers of persons in the state who have suffered convictions but are on probation or otherwise not imprisoned, the lprovision of access to dna testing. we find no constitutional violation. 12 disposition the order appealed from is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports willhite, j. we concur: epstein, p. j. manella, j.
