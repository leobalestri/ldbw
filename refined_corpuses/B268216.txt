( 459.) the information alleged that appellant had served six prior prison terms ( 667.5, subd. (b)) and had one prior strike ( 667, subds. (b)-(i), 1170.12, subds. (a)-(d)). on october 15, 2014, appellant pled no contest to count 1, second degree burglary of a commercial building occupied by el tucan. appellant admitted three of the prior convictions alleged in the information: (1) a 1995 prior strike for burglary (case no. pa021500), (2) a 2011 burglary (case no. pa069471), and (3) a 2013 violation of health and safety code section 11359 (case no. ba403517). on november 20, 2014, appellant moved to reduce his sentence under proposition 47, which had become effective on november 5, 2014. the court denied the motion. the court found appellant guilty of count 1 and dismissed the remaining counts pursuant to the plea agreement. the court sentenced appellant to the high term of three years, plus three years for the prior strike, plus one year each for the prior prison terms, for a total of eight years in state 1 further unspecified statutory references are to the penal code. 3 prison. the court also ordered appellant to pay restitution, which we discuss in further detail below. on july 30, 2015, appellant filed a petition for resentencing under section 1170.18. the trial court again denied the motion. the minute order states only november 20, 2014. appellant timely appealed. discussion neighborhoods and schools act . . . certain drug-and theft-related offenses misdemeanors, unless the offenses were committed by certain ineligible defendants. these offenses had previously been designated as either felonies or wobblers (crimes that can be [citation.] [] proposition 47 also added section 1170.18, concerning persons currently serving a sentence for a conviction of a crime that the proposition reduced to a misdemeanor. it that entered judgment of conviction in his or her case to request resentencing ( 1170.18, subd.

(f).) he argues that because the trial court did not order restitution for el tucan, the victim of the count to which appellant pled no contest, the value of the property at issue must have been less than $950. we are not persuaded. appellant has provided no evidence that the value of the property did not exceed $950. there is nothing in the record to reveal why the trial court did not order him to provide restitution to el tucan, and in the absence of any evidence we cannot assume this necessarily means the value of the property at issue was less than $950. must set out a case for eligibility, stating and in some cases showing the offense of conviction has been reclassified as a misdemeanor and, where the offense of conviction is a theft crime reclassified based on the value of stolen property, showing the value of the property did not exceed $950.

(sherow, supra, 239 cal.app.4th at pp. 878.) the court reasoned that applying the burden not be unfair or unreasonable. he knows what kind of items he took from the id. at p. 880.) the court in perkins relied on sherow in affirming the denial of a petition for resentencing without prejudice to the defendant filing a new petition. (perkins, supra, 244 cal.app.4th at pp. 133, 136-137.) the court petitioning for relief under proposition 47. though evidence code section 500 establishes petitioners have the burden of establishing eligibility, proposition 47 itself is silent on the point and the courts had not made the connection explicit until after defendant had filed his petition. moreover, proposition 47 is silent as to the submission of evidence or information to support an application for resentencing. in addition, the form defendant used 7 to petition includes no space for and no directions to include evidence or information regarding the value of stolen property. even the revised form the superior court now provides omits any discussion or directions about submitting evidence.
