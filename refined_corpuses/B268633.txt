(a)) and felony willful evasion of a police officer (veh. code,  2800.2, subd. (a)). the trial court found pinkston had suffered two prior felony convictions for manslaughter ( 192, subd. (a)) and making criminal threats ( 422), both serious or violent felonies within the meaning of the three strikes law ( 667 and 1170.12). the court sentenced pinkston to a term of 25 years to life in state prison for the felony willful evasion count and a concurrent term of 307 days in prison for the misdemeanor evading arrest count. the court imposed, but stayed pursuant to section 654, three 4 one-year prior prison term enhancements ( 667.5, subd. (b)). the court awarded pinkston 307 days of custody conduct credit. 2. proposition 36 proceedings in november 2012, pinkston filed a petition for resentencing under proposition 36. in july 2013, the people filed that pinkston was eligible for resentencing based on his past and current strike offenses, but asserted the court should deny d a revised opposition, arguing the court should deny the petition because resentencing pinkston would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety based on his criminal history and behavior in prison. in july 2014, pinkston filed a supplemental reply. on july 23, 2015, the court conducted a hearing on his conduct in prison since he was convicted of felony willful evasion of a police officer in 2002. in addition, pinkston submitted a written report drafted by richard subia, the former director of the california department (cdcr) division of adult history and behavior in custody, resentencing pinkston as a two-strike offender would not pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. pinkston also presented two live d that pinkston would live with and help care for her if he were to be released. petition, finding that resentencing him would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. pinkston filed a timely appeal. 5 discussion 1. proposition 47 did not change definition of dangerousness im that proposition 47 redefined the meaning used in proposition 36 requires us to interpret both acts. principles of statutory interpretation. (see people v. bankers ins. co. (2016) 247 cal.app.4th 1004, 1007.) . . . we apply the same principles that govern statutory construction.

(former  667, subds. (d), (e)(2)(a) & 1170.12, subds. (b), (c)(2)(a).) [proposition 36] amended the three strikes law with respect to defendants whose current conviction is for a felony that is neither serious nor violent. in that circumstance, unless an exception applies, the defendant is to receive a second strike sentence of twice the term otherwise provided for the current felony, pursuant to the provisions that apply when a defendant has one prior conviction for a serious or violent people v. johnson (2015) 61 cal.4th 674, 680681.) conviction release proceeding whereby a prisoner who is serving an indeterminate life sentence imposed pursuant to the three strikes law for a crime that is not a serious or violent felony and who is not disqualified, may have his or her sentence recalled and be sentenced as a second strike offender unless the court determines that resentencing would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. people v. yearwood (2013) 213 cal.app.4th 161, 168.) a court may consider the following factors in determining whether the petitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of danger s criminal conviction history, including the type of crimes committed, the extent of injury to victims, the length of prior prison commitments, and the remoteness of the crimes; [] (2) the petitioners disciplinary record and record of rehabilitation while incarcerated; and [] (3) any other evidence the court, within its discretion, determines to be relevant in deciding whether a new sentence would result in subd.

(c), italics added.) he arthis codepenal code, including into section 1170.126, subdivision (f). this issue has been considered by several appellate courts, and it currently is pending before the california supreme court. (see, e.g., people v. valencia (2014) 232 cal.app.4th 514, review granted february 18, 2015, s223825; people v. chaney (2014) 231 cal.app.4th 1391, review granted february 18, 2015, s223676; people v. lopez (2015) 236 cal.app.4th 518, review granted july 15, 2015, s227028; people v. florez (2016) 245 cal.app.4th 1176, review granted june 8, 2016, s234168; people v. myers (2016) 245 cal.app.4th 794, review granted may 25, 2016, s233937; people v. garcia (2016) 244 cal.app.4th 224, review granted april 13, 2016, s232679.) consistent with the majority of courts that have considered this issue, we conclude proposition 47onable risk of constitutional construction which mandates that courts, in construing a measure, not undertake to rewrite its unambiguous language. [citation.] that rule is not applied, however, when it appears clear that a word has been erroneously used, and a judicial correction will best carry out the intent of the adopting 10 skinner, supra, 39 cal.3d at p. 775.) we look to adopting that section to determine whether the use of a particular word is drafting error. (id. at p. 776.) as we shall explain, we conclude the voters erroneously 170.18, subdivision (c), instead courts. specifically, we find nothing in the text of proposition 47 to modify or otherwise affect proposition 36, and we believe proposition 36 would lead to illogical and unintended consequences. thus, we hold not alter the definition of that phrase as used in proposition 36. nothing in proposition 47s statutory language indicates would extend to provisions of the penal code outside proposition 47. to the contrary, section 1170.18 expressly limits proposition sections is intended to diminish or abrogate the finality of judgments in any case not falling within the purview of this act( 11more narrow definition of dangerousness to a petition filed under proposition 36, a court may diminish the finality of a judgment in a case falling outside the purview of proposition 47. for example, dangerousness to a resentencing petition filed under proposition 36, a court could not deny the petition unless it finds there is strikpose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. alone indicate, that the act would have an effect on 11 proposition 36. (voter information guide, supra, pp. 3439.) the ballot materials do not state proposition 47 would have any effect on the procedure a court must follow when reviewing a resentencing petition filed under proposition 36. to the contrary, those resentencing provisions would affect only those persons serving sentences for specified nonserious, nonviolent property or drug crimes, a class of crimes distinct from, and less serious than, those targeted by proposition 36. nowhere do those materials more serious and violent offenses that are the focus of proposition 36. in addition, propositions 36 and 47 serve different purposes. proposition 36 is designed to reduce penalties for individuals with two or more prior serious or violent felony convictions, whose current convictions are also felonies. by contrast, proposition 47 is intended to reduce penalties for low-level, nonserious and nonviolent offenses. (voter information guide, supra, p. 35.) the wording of section 1170.18, subdivision (c), is also inconsistent with an intent to apply that subdivision throughout a term that is used throughout proposition 47 to refer to persons subds. (a), (c), (e), (f), (i), (j), (m), (n), & (o).) accordingly, subdivision (c)term is limited to individuals petitioning under that particular acti.e., proposition 47. ( 1170.18, sub. (c).) inconsistent with an intent to affect the terms of proposition 36. proposition 36 required defendants to file petitions within two years from the date of its enactment absent a showing of good cause for a late petition. ( 1170.126, subd. (b).) as noted, proposition 47 went into effect only two days before the two-year 12 period for filing proposition 36 petitions expired. a rational voter would not have understood proposition 47 to change the rules for reviewing proposition 36 petitions when the period for filing such petitions had nearly expired and most of the filed petitions had already been adjudicated. for these reasons, we conclude section 1170.18, subdivision (c), is a drafting error nreasonable risk 2. the trial court properly found resentencing pinkston would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety pinkston contends the court erred in finding that resentencing him as a two-strike offender would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety because that finding is not supported by the record. we disagree and conclude the resentencing petition. 2.1. relevant facts 2.1.1. criminal history pinkston has an extensive criminal history. in 1981, when he was a teenager, pinkston committed a robbery, and the following year he committed an attempted robbery. in 1984, the juvenile court sustained a petition alleging pinkston received stolen property. in 1986, pinkston was convicted of possessing rock cocaine, and in 1987, he was convicted of possessing narcotics with the intent to sell. in 1989, pinkston was convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm. in 1992, pinkston pled guilty to voluntary manslaughter, his first strike offense, and he was sentenced to six years in prison. in 1992, pinkston was also convicted of assault with a deadly weapon, and in 1998, he pled 13 guilty to making criminal threats, his second strike offense. finally, in 2002, pinkston was convicted of the underlying offense of willfully evading a police officer, his third strike. during the incident for voluntary manslaughter, pinkston and his co-participant went to the home of the 65 year-old victim. -participant into the house, the co-participant took the victim upstairs and shot him in the back of the head, killing him. a pager registered in pinwas found inside the house. the police also recovered from pinkston claimed that someone had stolen the gun from his car before the homicide, and that it was not returned to him until after the crime was committed. during the incident that led to his 1998 criminal threats conviction, pinkston and another co-participant, both of whom were armed, approached the victim to demand the victim return money pinkston had given him in -participant struck the victim on the head with a gun, and pinkston threatened victim then jumped off his balcony, breaking bones in both of his heels. 2.1.2. misconduct in prison since being incarcerated in 2002, pinkston has received nine cdcr rules violation reports. five of the reports cited pinkston for fighting with other inmates in july 2004, april 2008, april 2010, march 2012, and june 2012. pinkston claimed that he did not initiate many of these fights and that he frequently was targeted by gang members because he refused to participate in gang activity while in prison. however, the reports for several of the fights found that pinkston had engaged in mutual combat, meaning the inmates were committing battery on each other and 14 prison officials were unable to determine who instigated the fights. after an incident in september 2005, pinkston was found guilty of committing battery on a peace officer. pinkston had refused to remove his hands from a food port. when the officer the hand and causing the officer pain. in december 2012, pinkston was placed in solitary confinement after he was cited for threatening the safety of a correctional officer assigned to inspect his cell. pinkston had appeal, pink remove me from the block, put a copy of the [appeal] in c/o gutierrez personal file. it will save his life. in july 2014, pinkston was cited for willfully resisting, delaying, or obstructing a peace officer after he refused to accept a cell mate. 2.1.3. participation in prison programs in june 2010, pinkston completed a 13-week group therapy program focused on issues of childhood trauma, anger, grief, loss, crimes on others. in october 2011, he completed a 10-week group therapy program focused on anger management and was commended for his hard work, active participation, and insight. pinkston also received training as an assistance giver for other inmates, and he sometimes worked as a barber and building porter in the prison. pinkston claimed that he did not participate 15 2.1.4. gang evidence pinkston has never been validated as a member of a gang while in prison.2 however, when he was first incarcerated in 1992, pinkston told prison officials that he was a member of the black p. stones, or black peace stones, criminal street gang, a subset of the bloods gang. in 2003, the prison placed a that pinkston appeared to be affiliated with the bloods based on the in 2004, pinkston was interviewed by a correctional officer about his gang affiliation. when asked, which set of the bloods he on the -ined by the prison, pinkston is identified as a suspected member of the 2.1.5. prison classification scores inmates based on the nature of the crimes leading to their institutionalization and their behavior in prison. a score of 19 is the lowest score an inmate can achieve. between 2002 and 2013, and 68. at the time he the cdcr also utilizes the california static risk assessment scoring system, which assigns inmates one of five scores based on their level of risk to recidivate, with 1 being the lowest and 5 being the highest. the system weighs 22 factors, including age at the time of release, gender, and the nature of the of 2014, pinkston was assigned a score of 1. 2 once he is that once an inmate is validated, he is removed from the general population and placed in solitary confinement. 16 2.1.6. post-release plan if released, pinkston plans to live with and care for his mother, who needs support after undergoing hip and knee replacement surgery. pinkston also has an offer for a fulltime job with his 2.2. analysis whether a petitioner poses an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety is a discretionary decision made by the trial court after reviewing the evidence presented in the case. (see  1170.126, subd. (f).) the people must prove by a preponderance of the evidence any facts the court relies on in making such a determination. (people v. jefferson (2016) 1 cal.app.5th 235, 241 (jefferson).) in the trial cdisturbed on appeal except on a showing that the court exercised its discretion in an arbitrary, capricious or patently absurd manner that resulted in a manifest miscarriage of justice. people v. rodrigues (1994) 8 cal.4th 1060, 1124the court erred in finding that resentencing him would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety for an abuse of discretion. (see jefferson, supra, 1 cal.app.5th at pp. 242243.) the appropriate test for abuse of discretion is whether the trial court exceeded the bounds of reason. when two or more inferences can reasonably be deduced from the facts, the reviewing court has no authority to substitute its decision for that of the trial court.shamblin v. brattain (1988) 44 cal.3d 474, 478479.) a merely debatable ruling cannot be deemed an abuse of discretion.people v. bryant, smith and wheeler (2014) 60 cal.4th 335, 390.) applying these principles in our review of 17 in making its determination that pinkston would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety if resentenced, the court focused on the following factorscriminal history; his involvement in numerous incidents of violence while in prison; his elevated reclassification score; his minimal participation in rehabilitative and self-help programs while in prison; evidence of his gang affiliation; and his lack of a structured post-release plan. each of these factors is supported by the record and was properly considered by the court in making its dangerousness determination. (see  1170.126, subd. (g) [in criminal history and circumstances of his crimes, his behavior in court . . . determines to be relevant in deciding whether a new sentence would result in an unreasonable risk of danger to public the court was concerned that these factors, when considered together, demonstrated that pinkston has a tendency to engage in violence and make poor decisions, issues that could be amplified if he were released into the community. we share engaged in criminal activity, much of which involved violence. from when he was first adjudicated as a juvenile in the early 1980s until he was convicted of his third strike in 2002, pinkston failed to go a significant length of time without committing a crime, and his violent behavior continued after he was incarcerated in 2002. between 2004 and 2012, pinkston was involved in at least five fights with other inmates, and he acted aggressively toward prison officials on several occasions, which, score remaining elevated throughout his incarceration. pinkston contends the court erred by failing to discuss his california static risk assessment score of 1 in its statement of 18 court is presumed to have considered all of the relevant factors in people v. myers (1999) 69 cal.app.4th 305, 310.) therefore, it is not error for a court to focus its discussion of its findings on only some of the relevant factors, and doing so does not mean the court considered only those factors that are expressly referenced. (ibid.) we therefore must presume the court considered discretion to give more weight to his elevated reclassification score. (see ibid.) in addition to the evidence demonstrating pinkston has a tendency to engage in violent behavior, there was evidence that pinkston is affiliated with a criminal street gang. although the prison never validated pinkston as a gang member, he admitted to prison officials on at least two occasions that he was a member of the observations of pinkston led prison officials to believe pinkston had gang connections. as the trial court observed, pinkston has never made any effort to disavow the perception that he is affiliated with the black p. stones gang. pinkston contends the court erred in relying on evidence of gang affiliation because pinkston is not a validated gang member. however, pinkston cites no authority limiting the idence to instances in which the petitioner has been validated as a member of a gang. because there was evidence that pinkston was affiliated with a criminal street gange.gstaff that he was a member of the black p. stones gangthe court properly considered this evidence when determining whether pinkston would pose a danger to public safety if resentenced. (see  1170.126, subd. (g)(3).) with respect to pinkston in two programs that focused on violence and anger management, the trial court believed pinkston could have made a greater effort to rehabilitate 19 and that his participation in those programs did not outweigh the factors demonstrating he would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety if resentencedi.e., his tendency to engage in violent behavior and his connection to a criminal street gang. the court also found pinkston did not have an adequate plan to reenter the community should he be released. the court help him remain crime free while out of custody, something he has been unable to do since he was a teenager. in light of utside and inside of prison, and his failure to adequately address his violent behavior while in custody, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding pinkston would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety if resentenced as a two-strike offender. disposition resentencing under proposition 36 is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports lavin, j. we concur: edmon, p. j. aldrich, j.
