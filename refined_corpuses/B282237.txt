(pen. code,  664/187, subd. (a).) in 2014, macias, apparently in response to people v. pedroza (2014) 231 cal.app.4th 635, which addressed accomplice testimony, filed a motion in the superior court to obtain transcripts from his prior trial in 2000 from the california department of corrections and rehabilitations (cdcr). the court apparently granted the motion, but the cdcr possessed no responsive documents. macias then filed a motion for contempt sanctions, which the court denied on january 26, 2017, citing lack of jurisdiction. in february 2017, macias filed a motion for reconsideration and renewed a motion for discovery pursuant to penal code section 1054.9. the trial court denied both motions without comment. macias appealed the order denying his motions. we appointed counsel to represent macias on appeal, and after examination of the record counsel filed an opening brief raising no issues and asking this court to review the record independently.
