(former pen. code,  12021, subdivision (a)(1),1 now  29800, subd. (a)(1).) the trial court found true prior conviction allegations and sentenced defendant to 25 years to life in state prison pursuant to the three strikes law. ( 667, subds. (b)-(i), 1170.12, subds. (a)-(d).) on november 28, 2012, following the passage of proposition 36, the three strikes reform act of 2012, defendant filed a petition requesting recall of his sentence pursuant to section 1170.126. the trial court denied the petition, finding defendant was ineligible for relief because he was armed with a firearm during the commission of the offense within the meaning of sections 667, subdivision (c)(2)(c)(iii) and section 1170.126, subdivision (e)(2). defendant appeals from the denial of his petition. we affirm. background in our prior opinion in this case we set forth the facts as follows: ey avenue, apartment number 101 in long beach on april 7, 1995. he lived there with rosso, visited defendant there about once a month. at approximately 8 p.m. that day, grosso went with four police officers to conduct a parole search of the apartment. barnes told grosso that defendant was at the gym. underneath a nightstand in the bedroom, grosso found a loaded .380 semiautomatic pistol and a box of ammunition. when questioned by police several days later, defendant stated that he had taken the gun and ammunschool about a week prior to his arrest. 1 all statutory citations are to the penal code unless otherwise noted. 3 -year-old shawnee testified that she found the gun in the bushes in front of her school during an altercation between black and mexican students. time later, in march or april of that year, shawnee brought the gun to a neighbor, kecia johnson, and told johnson how she had found it. johnson advised her to give it to her mom or dad. shawnee left johnson with the gun still in her possession. two days later, the nightstand. trash was picked up on saturday at the apartment and defendant told shawnee to throw the gun down the trash chute on saturday if he had to work that day. according to shawnee, defendant never touched the gun. about one week later, discussion i. standard of review we review de novo issues of statutory interpretation.

(people v. superior court (2013) 215 cal.app.4th 1279, 1285.) under proposition 36, a defendant who has two prior convictions for serious or violent felonies conviction is for a serious or violent felony. (id. at pp. 1285-1286.) proposition 36 also permits a defendant serving a sentence of 25 years to life for a third felony conviction that was not a serious or violent felony to seek court review of indeterminate sentence and, under certain circumstances, to obtain resentencing if the defendant had only one prior conviction for a serious or violent felony. (id. at p. 1286.) an inmate is excluded from proposition 36 resentencing if he was armed during the commission of the current offense. ( 1170.126, subd.

[defendant] said that he took it from [shawnee] and . . . placed defense counsel relied on . shawnee testified that after she told defendant about the gun, he told her to put it under the nightstand and he never touched the gun. grosso testifiednd of looking around the nightstandit was kind of heavyi was going to look under it and it was heavy. and he moved itreferring to another officer that was at the scenewas found [and] the box of ammunition that was under that sathe trial court found that defendant was ineligible for proposition 36 resentencing because he was armed with a firearmi.e., he had a firearm readily available for offensive or defensive use. it stated that while grosso may have testified that the nightstand was heavy, it was not immovable. defendant contends that eligibility for proposition 36 resentencing depends only on those facts actually found by the juryi.e., the facts that support the elements of the charged offense. the trial court erred in finding him ineligible, defendant argues, because the jury was not asked to resolve whether he had access to the gun and whether it was available for his use as arming was not an element of his possession of a firearm by a felon offense. 6 as stated above, the disqualifying exclusions in section 667, subdivision (e)(2)(c)(iii) and section 1170.12, subdivision (c)(2)(c)(iii) do not have to be based on facts found by the jury. (people v. blakely, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at 1058.) a trial cou (id. at pp. 1048, 1063.) accordingly, the trial court was not strictly limited to a consideration of the evidence that established the elements of the offense.

(e)(2)(c)(iii); 1170.12, subd.

[citation.] this in turn requires that the arming and the we agree with the numerous cases that defendant acknowledges have rejected his argument.

(people v. arevalo priate standard of proof is beyond a reasonable doubt]; people v. osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. arming determination under either standard, we need not decide which standard prevails. as set forth above, defendant told prell that shawnee brought home the handgun he told prell that he took the handgun from shawnee and placed it under the nightstand in the bedroom. defendant made his statement while in jail with no conceivable reason to inculpate himself. based on this evidence, a reasonable trier of fact would have found that defendant was armed under either the preponderance (people v. arevalo, supra, 244 cal.app.4th at p. 852) or the beyond a reasonable doubt standard of proof (people v. osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1040). defendant contends that his statement to prell is insufficient to support the arming finding beyond a reasonable doubt because shawnee subsequently provided exculpating testimony that she put the handgun under the nightstand. purported statement to the officers was not entirely inconsistent with this, as the supposed statement that he took the gun from her could have been based upon his figuratively doing so by proffered statement to prell is sufficiently plausible that the 8 statement. disposition the order is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. raphael, j. we concur: turner, p. j. judge of the superior court of the county of los angeles, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution. people v. willie lee gaither b267029 baker, j., dissenting in the years following enactment of proposition 36, the three strikes reform act of 2012, several court of appeal decisions confronted what was then a novel question: 1 is a felon in possession of a firearm conviction obtain proposition 36 relief notwithstanding a provision in the new law that bars relief for (pen. code,2  1170.126, subd. (e)(2), 667, subd. (e)(2)(c)(iii), 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(c)(iii).) one of the first such decisions was people v. white (2014) 223 cal.app.4th 512 (white), and several others followed. (see, e.g., people v. osuna (2014) 225 cal.app.4th 1020 (osuna); people v. blakely (2014) 225 cal.app.4th 1042 (blakely); people v. elder (2014) 227 cal.app.4th 1308 (elder).) the cases rejected both the view that a felon in possession of a firearm conviction was automatically disqualifying, and the view that a felon in possession conviction can never bar relief because the armed-with-a-firearm proviso in penal code sections 667, subdivision (e)(2)(c)(iii) and section 1170.12, subdivision (c)(2)(c)(iii) requires the (white, supra, 223 cal.app.4th at pp. 518, 524-525; blakely, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1048; see also people v. hicks (2014) 231 cal.app.4th 275, 283-284.) instead, these elder, supra, 227 1 e that triggers imposition of an indeterminate sentence under the three strikes law.

(see, e.g., osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at pp. 1029-blakely, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1051.) the cases accordingly concluded not all felons in this rationale, the cases avoided what would otherwise be a forceful defense argument, namely, that the drafters of proposition 36 (and the voters who passed it) cannot have intended the armed-with-a-firearm proviso to always prohibit relief to a felon in possession of a firearm defendant because if they had, they would have simply included the felon in possession of a firearm statute (now, section 29800; formerly, section 12021) among the crimes enumerated as categorically ineligible for proposition 36 relief.

(but see people v. hicks, supra, 231 cal.app.4th at pp. 280, 284 [defendant armed when apprehended at gate of apartment complex even though gun found in a backpack inside one of the the controlling rule, the circumstances under which a felon in possession defendant might be eligible for proposition 36 relief are so de minimis as to call into question the foundation for the reasoning in white, osuna, blakely, and elderall opinions on which 4 the majority relies.
