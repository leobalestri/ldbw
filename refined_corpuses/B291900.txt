filed 11/20/19 p. v. leon ca2/2 not to be published in the official reports california rules of court, rule 8.1115(a), prohibits courts and parties from citing or relying on opinions not certified for publication or ordered published, except as specified by rule 8.1115(b). this opinion has not been certified for publication or ordered published for purposes of rule 8.1115. in the court of appeal of the state of california second appellate district division two the people, plaintiff and respondent, v. francisco baltazar leon, defendant and appellant. b291900 (los angeles county super. ct. no. ba459687) appeal from orders of the superior court of los angeles county. henry j. hall, judge. affirmed. carlo andreani, under appointment by the court of appeal, for defendant and appellant. xavier becerra, attorney general, lance e. winters, senior assistant attorney general, steven d. matthews and analee j. brodie, deputy attorneys general, for plaintiff and respondent. _________________________________ 2 francisco leon appeals the denial of a motion to withdraw his plea of no contest. he also contends, pursuant to people v. dueas (2019) 30 cal.app.5th 1157 (dueas), that the matter should be remanded to the trial court for a determination of his ability to pay the restitution fine (pen. code,1  1202.4, subd. (b)(1)), the court operations assessment ( 1465.8, subd. (a)(1)), and the criminal conviction assessment (gov. code,  70373) imposed at sentencing. only appellandueas claim, which we reject, is cognizable in this appeal: because he did not obtain a certificate of probable cause, appellant cannot challenge the denial of his request to withdraw his no contest plea.2 accordingly, we affirm. procedural background appellant was charged by information with committing a lewd act upon a child ( 288a; count 1), forcible rape ( 261, subd. (a)(2); count 2), and sodomy by use of force ( 286, subd. (c)(2)(a); count 3). it was further alleged as to count 1 that appellant personally inflicted bodily harm on the victim who was under 14 years of age ( 667.61, subds. (a), (d)(7)), and as to all three counts that the offenses were committed against more than one victim ( 667.61, subds. (b), (c), (e)). the prosecution subsequently moved without objection to amend the information 1 undesignated statutory references are to the penal code. 2 even if the appeal goes forward without a certificate of probable cause, based upon claims that do not require one, the defendant may not raise additional claims that do require a certificate. (people v. johnson (2009) 47 cal.4th 668, 678, fn. 4 (johnson).) 3 to add count 4, forcible lewd act on a child ( 288, subd. (b)(1)) with a great bodily injury allegation ( 12022.8). appellant pleaded no contest to counts 1 through 4 and admitted the section 12022.8 allegation for an agreed determinate sentence of 33 years in state prison.3 at the sentencing hearing a month later, appellant moved to withdraw his would like to let you know that i want to take back the offer i accepted. i defense counsel was unaware of any legal reason to set aside the plea, and the trial court denied the request, not a reason for setting aside a plea. and i find there is a factual sentenced appellant to the agreed-upon term of 33 years in state prison, awarded presentence custody credit, and imposed a $40 court operations assessment ( 1465.8, subd. (a)(1)) for each count of conviction, a $30 criminal conviction assessment (gov. code,  70373) for each count of conviction, and a $300 restitution fine ( 1202.4, subd. (b)(1)) for a total of $580. appellant filed a timely notice of appeal challenging the validity of the plea as well as the sentence or other matters occurring after the plea. in his accompanying request for certificate of probable cause, appellant declared under penalty of perjury: rtificate of probable cause, because i was mislead [sic] in the proceedings of basic law, and was taken 3 maximum exposure on counts 1, 2, and 3 was 55 years to life. 4 advantage of by my attorney on my case. i was told by my because i am not a[n] discovered that i did have a right to an appeal like americans do, and even if i am a non-citizen, guranteed [sicmaliciously mislead [sic] me. after asking numerous times that i want to go to trial! if i would have known or understood before a[n] innocent man. so please help me in the interest of true the trial court denied the request for certificate of probable this comandate, and the california supreme court denied his petition for review.4 discussion i. without a certificate of probable cause from denial of his request to withdraw his plea is not cognizable on appeal notwithstanding his failure to obtain a certificate of probable cause, appellant contends that the trial court 4 appellant filed his petition for writ of mandate in case number b295553, and his petition for review in case number s254360. as requested by respondent, we have taken judicial n for writ of mandate. (evid. code,  452, subd. (d).) 5 erroneously denied his motion to withdraw his plea. he argues that he is entitled to raise this claim without a certificate because the trial court failed to advise appellant of his right to appeal and appellant is wrong. in general, unless a defendant obtains a certificate of probable cause, no appeal will lie from the judgment following entry of a plea of guilty or no contest with an agreed upon sentence.5 ( 1237.5; people v. panizzon (1996) 13 cal.4th 68, 76; people v. hurlic (2018) 25 cal.app.5th 50, 53 (hurlic).) the california supreme court has declared that this prerequisite to an appeal from people v. mendez (1999) 19 cal.4th 1084, 1098.) , for example, a certificate must be obtained when a defendant claims that a plea was induced by misrepresentations of a fundamental nature [citation] or that the plea was entered at a time when the defendant was mentally incompetent [citation]. similarly, a certificate is required when a defendant claims that warnings regarding the effect of a guilty plea on the right to 5 the requirements of section 1237.5 are implemented by california rules of court, rule 8.304(b), which provides that an appeal from a judgment after a plea of guilty or nolo contendere may proceed without a certificate if the notice of appeal states that the appeal is based on the denial of a motion to suppress evidence under section 1538.5 or on [g]rounds that arose after entry of the plea and do not affect the pleas validity. (cal. rules of court, rule 8.304(b)(4)(b).) (johnson, supra, 47 cal.4th at p. 677, fn. 3; see people v. kaanehe (1977) 19 cal.3d 1, 8 (kaanehe).) 6 appeal were inadequate. (people v. kaanehe (1977) 19 cal.3d 1, 8.)panizzon, at p. 76.) the high court has also held that [a] defendant must obtain a certificate of probable cause in order to appeal from the denial of a motion to withdraw a guilty plea, even though such a motion involves a proceeding that occurs after the guilty plea.(johnson, supra, 47 cal.4th at p. 679.) although appellant any right to appeal the denial of his request to withdraw his plea, he contends the appeal is cognizable here because the trial court failed to advise him of his appellate rights after sentencing and abused its discretion in denying the certificate of probable cause. both assertions lack merit. appellant cites no relevant authority in support of his rights eliminated the necessity for a certificate of probable cause. california rules of court, rule 4.305, cited by appellant, does not support his position. by its terms, the rule requires the trial court to advise the defendant of the right to appeal and the fter imposing sentence or making an order deemed to be a final judgment in a criminal case on conviction after trial (cal. rules of court, rule 4.305, italics added.) there was no trial here; hence the trial court had no duty to advise appellant of his appellate rights under rule 4.305. none of the cases appellant cites has anything to do with defendant of his appellate rights following the entry of a no contest plea eliminates the prerequisites to an appeal under section 1237.5. (see people v. leftwich (1979) 97 cal.app.3d 7 supp. 6, 9 [court granted motion for relief from default based on as motion to allow the late filing of the notice of appeal]; people v. baltor (1978) 77 cal.app.3d 227, 230233 [defendant failed to establish right to relief from untimely filing of notice of appeal people v. serrano (1973) 33 cal.app.3d 331, 337338 [former superior court rule requiring trial judge to advise defendant of right to appeal inapplicable where defendant had pleaded guilty].) hurlic is misplaced. in hurlic, the defendant entered a no contest plea and admitted a sentencing enhancement allegation under section 12022.53, subdivision (c). (hurlic, supra, 25 cal.app.5th at pp. 5354.) the trial court imposed the agreed-upon sentence in september 2017, and defendant filed a timely notice of appeal without obtaining a certificate of probable cause. (id. at p. 54.) on october 11, 2017, the governor signed senate bill no. 620 (20172018 reg. sess.) into law, which granted trial courts the discretion to strike the firearm enhancements under section 12022.53. ( 12022.53, subd. (h), as amended by stats. 2017, ch. 682,  2.) the new law became effective on january 1, 2018, in which he sought relief under senate bill no. 620was pending. in reaching the merits of the appeal, we held that no certificate of probable cause was required to challenge an agreed-upon sentence where, after sentencing, the legislature enacted a statute that retroactively granted the trial court discretion to waive a previously mandatory sentencing enhancement. (hurlic, supra, 25 cal.app.5th at p. 53.) 8 hurlic has no application to the instant case simply because no new law way has been enacted or has become operative during the pendency of this appeal. for the same reason, our supreme s of review in people v. kelly (2019) 32 cal.app.5th 1013 (review granted june 12, 2019, s2551456) and people v. barton (2019) 32 cal.app.5th 1088 (review granted june 19, 2019, s2552147) have no bearing here because, unlike those cases, there has been no ameliorative change in the law that appellant further maintains that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to consult with appellant to discover his 6 the high court articulated the following is a certificate of probable cause required for a defendant to challenge a negotiated sentence based on a subsequent ameliorative, retroactive change in the law?(<https://appellatecases.courtinfo.ca.gov/search/case/maincasescreen.cfm?dist=0&doc_id=2283336&doc_no=s255145&request_token=niiwlsiktkg%2bwzbdscjnseniqfg0udxtjinoqz5sicagcg%3d%3d&bck=yes> [as of nov. 14, 2019], archived at <https://perma.cc/9mjl-whb6>.) 7 this case includes the following issue: does a defendants waiver of the right to appeal his or her sentence as part of a plea agreement preclude a future challenge to the stipulated sentence based on an ameliorative, retroactive change in the law?(<https://appellatecases.courtinfo.ca.gov/search/case/maincasescreen.cfm?dist=0&doc_id=2283754&doc_no=s255214&request_token=niiwlsiktkg%2bwzbdscjdxeliqfw0udxtjinotztsmcagcg%3d%3d&bck=yes> [as of nov. 14, 2019], archived at <https://perma.cc/2nys-jkuu>.) 9 wishes and for failing to file a notice of appeal and/or a certificate remanded for an evidentiary hearing on the denials of sixth amendment effective assistance and fourteenth amendment probable cause stands as a roadblock to this claim as well. our supreme court has held that claims of ineffective representation on a motion to withdraw a plea are not exempt from the requirement that the defendant obtain a certificate of probable cause as a condition for raising the issue on appeal. ( 1237.5; johnson, supra, 47 cal.4th at pp. 684685; see people v. stubbs (1998) 61 cal.app.4th 243, 244245.) as the high court deprived of effective representation on a motion to withdraw his or her plea were permitted to go forward without a certificate, many frivolous appeals likely would result. requiring the trial court, which is familiar with the record, to determine in the first instance whether a nonfrivolous claim exists serves the purposes of section 1237.5 without interfering with a defendants right to johnson, at p. 685.) on the other hand, if the trial court is not in a position to issue a certificate of probable cause because of factual issues outside the record requiring an evidentiary hearing, then any m of johnson, at p. 684; see people v. mendoza tello (1997) 15 cal.4th 264, 266267.) supreme court decision in garza v. idaho (2019) __ u.s. __ [139 s.ct. 738] (garza), is irrelevant to this case. in garza, the defendant signed plea agreements arising from state criminal 10 charges in which he waived his right to appeal. (garza, supra, 139 s.ct. at p. 742.) despite the defendant his attorney failed to file a notice of appeal, and the time for defendant to pursue an appeal lapsed. (id. at p. 743.) defendant alleged that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to file notices of appeal. (ibid.) the high court reversed, applying the rule announced in roe v. flores-ortega (2000) 528 u.s. 470, 484, costs a defendant an appeal that the defendant would have otherwise pursued, prejudice to the defendant should be presumed with no further showing from the defendant of the merits of his underlying claims. (garza, supra, 139 s.ct. at p. 742.) in so holding, the court declared the presumption of prejudice recognized in flores-ortega applies regardless of whether the defendant has signed an appeal waiver. (ibid.) garza has no bearing whatsoever on the requirement under section 1237.5 that a defendant must obtain a certificate of probable cause in order to pursue an appeal following entry of a guilty or no contest plea. garza thus has no application here because the appeal is precluded for want of a certificate of notice of appeal on his behalf based on his execution of an appeal waiver. finally, on august 16, 2018, this court issued the following tice filed on august 6, 2018, is limited to issues that do not require a certificate of probable court erred in refusing to allow him to withdraw his plea plainly requires a certificate of probable cause and thus violates this cpeople v. 11 hoffard (1995) 10 cal.4th 1170, 1180, fn. 8 [appellate court correctly declines to hear issues going to validity of plea where trial court denied certificate of probable cause]; people v. castelan (1995) 32 cal.app.4th 1185, 11871189.) ii. appellant is not entitled to a hearing to determine his ability to pay the restitution fine and assessments appellant contends he is entitled to a remand to the trial court for a hearing on his ability to pay the restitution fine and court assessments under dueas, supra, 30 cal.app.5th 1157. we reject the claim. first, in people v. hicks (2019) 40 cal.app.5th 320, 322, 329, we concluded dueas was wrongly decided and rejected its due process precludes a court from impos[ing] certain assessments and fines when sentencing a criminal defendant absent a finding that the defendant has a present ability to pay them. (accord, people v. aviles (2019) 39 cal.app.5th 1055, 10671068 [dueas people v. caceres (2019) 39 cal.app.5th 917, 923, 926927 [dueas due process analysis does not justify extending its holding beyond facts]; people v. kopp (2019) 38 cal.app.5th 47, 96that the court hold an ability to pay hearing before imposing a punitive fine and only impose the fine if it determines the second, we agree with the people object to the imposition of the restitution fine or assessments and his failure to assert any ability to pay them (unlike the defendant in dueas) forfeited the issue on appeal. generally, where a defendant has failed to object to a restitution fine or court fees 12 based on an inability to pay, the issue is forfeited on appeal. (people v. aguilar (2015) 60 cal.4th 862, 864 to challenge the fees in the trial court precludes him from doing people v. avila (2009) 46 cal.4th 680, 729.) we agree with our colleagues in division eight that this general rule applies here to the restitution fine and the assessments imposed under the penal and government codes. (people v. bipialaka (2019) 34 cal.app.5th 455, 464; people v. frandsen (2019) 33 cal.app.5th 1126, 11531155; but see people v. castellano (2019) 33 cal.app.5th 485, 488.) finally, even if dueas were good law, we would conclude imposing $580 in monetary obligations was harmless because the prison wages appellant earns while serving his 33-year sentence will certainly eclipse that amount. (see people v. johnson (2019) to pay $370 while serving an eight-year prison sentence is unsustain; people v. hennessey (1995) 37 cal.app.4th 1830, 1837 [dbility to pay includes the future ability to obtain prison wages and to earn money after release from custody].) 13 disposition the orders of the superior court are affirmed. not to be published. lui, p. j. we concur: chavez, j. hoffstadt, j.
