(people v. good (sept. 11, 2015, b261180) [nonpub. opn.].)2 1 all further undesignated statutory references are to the penal code. 2 we take judicial notice of our unpublished opinions.

(stats. 2014, ch. 749, 2013-2014 reg. sess.) as pertinent here, that act amended health and safety code section 11351.5 to reduce the proscribed sentencing triad for possession of cocaine base for sale from three, four, or five years to two, three, or four years. (stats. 2014, ch. 749,  3.) the (powder cocaine) and cocaine base (crack cocaine) are two forms of the same drug, the effects of which on the human body are so similar that to mete out unequal punishment for the same crime (e.g., possession for sale of a particular form of cocaine), is wholly (stats. 2014, ch. 749,  id., subd. (b).) on june 1, 2015, good filed in the superior court a document captioned for recall and resentencing pursuant to senate bill no. 1010 recommending lower rate compliexplained good had not been sentenced under the determinate sentencing law, but under the three strikes law. under the three strikes sentencing scheme, good received a mandatory term of 25 years to life, plus a consecutive one year enhancement pursuant to entitled to resentencing. good appeals. discussion after review of the record, appellant-appointed counsel filed an opening brief that raised no issues, and requested this court to conduct an independent review of the record pursuant to people v. wende (1979) 25 cal.3d 436, 441. on january 8, 2016, we advised appellant that he had 30 days to submit by brief or letter any contentions or argument he wished this court to consider. we have received no response. 4 even assuming arguendo that the amendment to health and safety code section opposed to possessing it for sale), that the petition was a proper procedural vehicle by which to request resentencing, and that the trial courthe trial ive sentencing scheme. (people v. superior court (romero) (1996) 13 cal.4th 497, 527.) because good was properly sentenced pursuant to the three strikes law, he was subject to a mandatory indeterminate term of 25 years to life. (see people v. johnson (2015) 61 cal.4th 674, 680-681; teal v. superior court (2014) 60 cal.4th 595, 596.) the amendment to the determinate sentencing triad is therefore inapplicable to good because he was sentenced to an indeterminate term pursuant to the three strikes law. we have examined the entire record and are satisfied appellantcomplied with the responsibilities of counsel and no arguable issues exist.
