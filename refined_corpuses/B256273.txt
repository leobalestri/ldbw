(a)(17)), the trial court sentenced them to life without possibility of parole. on appeal, johnson and mackbee argue that (1) the special circumstance finding is defective because the jury was not instructed that it must find that a robbery participant who was not the killer either acted with the intent to kill or was a major participant acting with reckless indifference to human life, (2) such a finding is not otherwise supported by substantial evidence, (3) the court erred in not instructing the jury that it must unanimously agree which robbery they aided and abetted, and (4) the court erred in imposing a $10,000 parole revocation fine.2 johnson further argues that the court violated the confrontation clause and the rules of evidence in admitting out-of-court statements by mackbee implicating johnson. although the court did not err in declining the jury instructions were defective and that this defect was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. ding as to the special circumstance and vacate the resulting sentences. because there was nevertheless substantial evidence to support such a finding of the special circumstance, we remand so that the people may elect whether to retry that special circumstance or have the trial court impose sentence without the special circumstance finding. this disposition renders moot the propriety of the parole revocation fine. facts and procedural background in early 2011, philip williamson (williamson) was in the business of importing ing it to 1 unless otherwise indicated, all further statutory references are to the penal code. 2 they also contend that the trial court erred in awarding them no presentence custody credits. that issue became moot when the court granted this relief in post-trial motion. 3 marijuana dispensaries in west los angeles. he ran the business out of his westside apartment, and kept a gun. just before march 24, 2011, williamson had stowed in his apartment approximately 11 pounds of sour diesel marijuana and somewhere between in cash. marcel mackabee (marcel)3 knew williamson and would sometimes smoke marijuana with him. marcel decided to rob williamson. marcel enlisted the aid of -johnson it is unclear whether the three planned in advance to shoot williamson: marcel later said they had not the robbery took place on march 24, 2011. around noon that day, marcel drove his 4-runner to west los angeles: a video camera at a west los angeles 7-eleven recorded marcel buying verizon calling cards at 12:27 p.m., and the receipt for that purchase was a cell tower near that 7-eleven at the same time. later that evening, marcel drove williamson to the residential garage in long beach where johnson and his girlfriend lived at the time. a police car with license-plate -runner parked on a nearby street at 10:13 pm. johnson and mackbee met marcel and williamson inside the garage. johnson posed as a businessman; he wore a suit and brought a briefcase. the meeting in the garage ended when either johnson or mackbee shot williamson once in the head. it is unclear which of the two pulled the trigger. johnson told his girlfriend and others that he had shot williamson and was upset that mackbee was taking credit for the shooting, while mackbee told others he was the shooter. 3 we use his first name to avoid confusion given the similarity of his last name to 4 johnson, mackbee and marcel put williamson in the back of the 4-runner and dumped him in an alley in just his underwear, socks and a t-shirt. beside his body, they left a p williamson was not yet dead, and he was still gasping for air when paramedics found him. williamson died a few days later from the single gunshot wound to the head. after dumping williamson, johnson changed clothes and met up with his as they spoke, johnson placed bags of clothing he had sliced up with scissors into different dumpsters. that same night, johnson visited another friend and looked as if he were about to cry. he showed the friend a revolver wrapped in a towel, which he then used to wipe down the gun. when police later searched were gone. marcel told a friend he had $100,000 in his car, and police later seized $38,700 in cash from ; neither johnson nor mackbee knew anything about the additional cash and mariju in the days after the robbery, johnson asked his girlfriend to burn some of his clothes in a fire pit, and then told her she was an accessory to murder for doing so. mackbee also burned a jumpsuit in the fire. the garage floor had a big stain that looked and the futon in the garage had blood spots. johnson and mackbee repeatedly scrubbed the garage floor with chemicals, put bleach on rugs from the garage floor, and disposed of the futon. about a month after the shooting, mackbee and put it in a plastic bag. after the robbery, both johnson and mackbee possessed sour diesel marijuana, including a big bag of it that they stored in the garage. johnson started driving a black , and mackbee told a . 5 in 2012, the people charged johnson and mackbee with first-degree murder ( 187, subd. (a)).4 the people also alleged that this was a special circumstance murder because it was committed in the course of a robbery ( 190.2, subd. (a)(17)) and alleged that a principal was armed with a firearm ( 12022, subd. (a)(1)). the people further alleged that johnson had served one prior prison term ( 667.5, subd. (b)) and that mackbee had served four. following trial, the jury convicted johnson and mackbee of first-degree murder, and found the special circumstance and firearm allegations to be true. the court struck the prior prison term enhancements. the trial court sentenced each defendant to life without the possibility of parole on the murder count, plus an additional year for the firearm allegation. each defendant timely appealed. discussion i. special circumstance finding court did not instruct the jury on some of the elements necessary for the special circumstancenamely, that any participant in the robbery who was not the actual killer either acted with the intent to kill or was a major participant acting with reckless indifference to human life ( 190.2, subds. (c) & (d)), and (2) the evidence to support these additional elements is legally insufficient, such that double jeopardy precludes any retrial on the special circumstance (people v. eroshevich (2014) 60 cal.4th 583, 591 hen a reversal rests upon the ground that the prosecution has failed to produce sufficient evidence . . ., the double jeopardy clause bars the prosecutor from making a second attempt at convictiontibbs v. florida (1982) 457 u.s. 31, 42.) we independently review questions of instructional error and the sufficiency of the evidence 4 marcel was charged and tried separately. his conviction and sentence were affirmed on appeal in an unpublished opinion. (see people v. mackabee (june 20, 2014, b250143).) 6 (people v. fiore (2014) 227 cal.app.4th 1362, 1378 [instructional error]; people v. banks (2015) 61 cal.4th 788, 804 (banks) a. instructional error 1. was there error? a defendant found guilty of first-degree murder is to be sentenced to death or life without the possibility of parole if the people charge, and a was committed while the defendant was engaged in, or was an accomplice in, the commission of . . . [] [r]obbery.the person who committed the murder during the robbery, nothing further need be proven. ( 190.2, subd.

(c)), , aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces, solicits, requests, these additional showings are elements of the special circumstance allegation. (e.g., people v. jones (2003) 30 cal.4th 1084, 1119 (jones); see also calcrim no. 703 [pattern jury instruction spelling out these additional elements].) a trial court thus has a sua sponte duty to instruct a jury on these elements as part of its broader obligation to (people v. cummings (1993) 4 cal.4th 1233, 1311; see also apprendi v. new jersey (2000) 530 u.s. 466, 469 [jury must find facts that increase a sentence beyond a reasonable doubt]; people v. davis (2005) 36 cal.4th 510, 567 [so noting, as to special 7 circumstance instruction on the additional elements (people v. delgado (2013) 56 cal.4th 480, 488).5 the evidence established that there was only one shooter, and that the shooter was either johnson or mackbee. as to whomever was the shooter, there would be no instructional error because the people do not need to prove the additional elements set forth above as to the actual killer. (people v. letner & tobin (2010) 50 cal.4th 99, 194 [finding no error in omission of additional elements at issue in this case as to actual killer]; lancaster, supra, 41 cal.4th at p. 90 [same]; people v. young (2005) 34 cal.4th 1149, 1206 [same].) the problem is this: as the prosecutor acknowledged during closing argument, the evidence does not conclusively establish which of the twojohnson or mackbeewas the killer. because only one of them was the killer and because the other one was necessarily not the killer, either one of them could be a robbery participant who was not the killer. as a result, the trial court was obligated to instruct on the additional elements relevant to nonkillers as to both johnson and mackbee. yet the court did not instruct on these additional elements as to either defendant. accomplice in the commission of a robbery; and (2) the murder was committed in order to carry out or advance the commis the additional elements are entirely absent, and this omission constitutes instructional error even in the absence of a request for those instructions. (people v. mil (2012) 53 cal.4th 400, 409 (mil).) 2. was the error harmless beyond a reasonable doubt? w]hen a trial court fails to instruct the jury on an element of a special circumstance allegation, the prejudicial effect of the error must be measured under the test set forth in chapman v. california mil, supra, 53 cal.4th 5 however, the jury need not expressly make a finding as to each element of this special circumstance. (people v. castenada (2011) 51 cal.4th 1292, 1327; people v. carter (2003) 30 cal.4th 1166, 1200-1201.) 8 at p. 409; people v. jones onclude beyond a mil, at p. 417, quoting neder v. united states (1998) 527 u.s. 1, 19.) the omission of an mil, at p. 410, quoting neder, at p. 17.) conversely, the omission of an element is not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt if the record contains evidence that could rationally lead to a contrary finding with respect mil, at p. 417, quoting neder, at p. 19; people v. sandoval (2007) 41 cal.4th 825, 838.) as noted above, although there is instructional error only as to the robbery participant who was not the actual killer, we do not know whether that person is johnson or mackbee. thus, the only way we can conclude that the instructional error in this case is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt is if it is harmless as to both johnson and evidence that would preclude a finding to the contrarythat each defendant (1) acted with the intent to kill, or (2) was a major participant in the robbery who acted with reckless indifference to human life? we will address the second question first. the statutory requirement that a nonkiller who participates in a robbery be a tison v. arizona (1987) 481 u.s. 137. (see banks, supra, 61 cal.4th at p. 794.) our supreme court has looked to tison to define those terms. (id. at p. 798.) banks, supra, 61 cal.4th at p. 802; people v. williams (2015) 61 cal.4th 1244, 1281.) courts are to examine the totality of the circumstances when evaluating the extent of participation, 9 including several factors our supreme court has identified as relevant but not dispositive dangers posed by the nature of the crime, weapons used, or past experience or conduct of of the killing, such that they actions after the use of lethal force. (banks, at pp. 802-803 & fn. 5.) (banks, supra, 61 cal.4th at p. 801, quoting people v. estrada (1995) 11 cal.4th 568, 577 (estrada), quoting tison, suprabanks, at p. 802, quoting tison, at p. 152), although jurors may infer that subjective awareness from the nature of the criminal activity itself (e.g., people v. mora (1995) 39 cal.app.4th nature of his criminal activity]). contrary to what johnson and mackbee suggest, statements from the charged defendants themselves regarding their mental state are not required. gh to banks, at p. 809, fn. 8.) the evidence presented at trial overwhelmingly establishes that both johnson and although the evidence is disputed as to whether the plan was to murder williamson, there was overwhelming evidence of a plan to rob him: marcel coaxed williamson down to long beach; mackbee recruited johnson to pose as a businessman having some interest in williamson; and johnson got dressed up to play that part. more to the point, both johnson and mackbee were present in the garage when one of them shot banks, supra, 10 61 cal.4th at p. 803, fn. 5.) both johnson and mackbee possessed a firearm after the shooting. both put williamson in the 4-runner and then dumped him in the alley. and whether johnson and mackbee subjectively appreciated that their acts were likely to result in the taking of innocent life is, in our view, a much closer question. on the one h th mackbee and johnson also claimed to have been the shooter after the fact, yet one of them was lying because there was only one shooter; moreover, such a post-crime boast sheds no light on what the nonkiller knew in advance of the robbery. on the other hand, there was no evidence that, prior to the robbery, johnson or mackbee or marcel had ever shot anyone, or otherwise brandished or possessed a gun. more to the point, marcel indicated that shooting williamson had not been part of their plan and that johnson had -robbery conduct seems to corroborate the from this evidence, a jury could rationally conclude that the was unexpected and impulsive, and thus could rationally find that the nonkiller did not subjectively appreciate that the planned robbery was likely to lead to a death. this very same logic makes it possible for a rational jury to conclude that the nonkiller also had no intent to kill. as a result, the instructional error was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt and the special circumstance finding infected by this error must be vacated. b. sufficiency of the evidence in evaluating the sufficiency of the evidence to support a special circumstance finding, we must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution and ask whether there is substantial evidencethat is, evidence that is reasonable, credible, and of solid valueto support the finding beyond a reasonable doubt. (people v. boyce 11 (2014) 59 cal.4th 672, 691; people v. edwards (2013) 57 cal.4th 658, 715.) as noted above, this question remains relevant despite our vacating of the special circumstance finding because a finding of legal insufficiency would bar any retrial. in this case, there is sufficient evidence to support a finding that johnson and mackbee each was a major participant who acted with reckless indifference to human life within the meaning of section 190.2, subdivision (d) and the cases interpreting that participation in the robbery was overwhelming and thus far in excess of what is necessary subjective appreciation of the risk of death, while not overwhelming enough to render the instructional error harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, was nonetheless substantial ohnson] would be the them not only appreciated a danger of death but were taking active steps to kill. (e.g., pope v. babick (2014) 229 johnson and mackbee analogize themselves to a getaway driver in a robbery who out a gun and shoots someone. they are correct that a sentence of death or, in california, armed robbery, not on the scene, who neither intended to kill nor was found to have had tison, supra, 481 u.s. at p. 149 [discussing enmund v. florida (1982) 458 u.s. 782]; banks, supra, 61 cal.4th at pp. 799, 804-805 [concluding that a getaway driver who had no role in planning the robbery was not a major participant].) but such a sentence may be impacts and mental state meet the requirements of section 190.2, subdivisions (c) and (d). who supplied his coparticipant with a gun, which the coparticipant used to shoot a robbery victim during their second armed robbery together (people v. proby (1998) 60 12 cal.app.4th 922, 928-929); as to a defendant who planned a robbery with two others, saw his coparticipant with a knife, and struck the victim with his fists until one coparticipant ran in and stabbed the victim to death with the knife (people v. bustos (1994) 23 cal.app.4th 1747, 1754-1755); and as to a defendant who helped plan the robbery of a drug dealer involving a copartithe coparticipant shot the drug dealer (people v. mora (1995) 39 cal.app.4th 607, 617). along with their major participation in the robbery and their presence at the shooting itself, constitute sufficient evidence to support a finding of the special circumstance. ii. unanimity instruction johnson and mackbee contend that there were two robberiesthe robbery of williamson in the garage and a second robbery when someone (likely marcel) went back and that the trial court erred in not instructing the jury that it must unanimously agree on which of the two robberies underlies the felony-murder charge. we review this instructional error de novo. a jury verdict must be unanimous. (cal. const., art. i,  16.) consequently, ust elect among the crimes or the court must require the jury to agree on the same criminal people v. russo instruction is not required when the acts alleged are so closely connected as to form part people v. harris (1994) 9 cal.4th 407, 431, fn. 14, quoting people v. stankewitz (1999) 51 cal.3d 72, 100.) nfined to a fixed locus, but is frequently spread people v. laursen (1972) 8 cal.3d 192, 199-200; people v. johnson (1992) 5 cal.app.4th 552, 561.) here, williamson was shot in the garage and his keys, wallet and some marijuana 13 were taken; the marijuana and cash in his apartment were taken soon thereafter. what is more, johnson, mackbee and marcel robbed williamson in order to take his marijuana f personal property in the possession of another, from his person or ( 211.) as williamson lay dying in the alley or in the hospital, the person who removed the marijuana williamson. indeed, that personpeople v. davis (2005) 36 cal.4th 510, 562.) the trial court thus did not err in refusing to give an unanimity instruction. iii. imposition of $10,000 parole revocation fine johnson and mackbee assert that the trial court erred in imposing but staying a $10,000 parole revocation fine under section 1202.45 because their sentences of life without possibility of parole preclude the possibility of parole. (see people v. oganesyan allow for parole and there is no evidence it ever will, no additional restitution fine must is now moot in light of our conclusion that the special circumstance findingand the resulting sentence of life without possibility of parolemust be vacated. whether a parole revocation fine is appropriate on remand depends upon whether the people seek to retry johnson or mackbee on the special circumstance and whether the jury finds that circumstance to be true. iv. johnson alone argues that the trial court erred in admitting evidence of three out-of--time friend (and t he and johnson committed the robbery; (2) 14 ohnson] would be the s own girlfriend that he and johnson and the money and the johnson argues that the admission of these statements (1) violated his right to confront witnesses under bruton v. united states (1968) 391 u.s. 123, 135-136 and people v. aranda (1965) 63 cal.2d 518, 526-527, and constitutional error de novo (people v. mayo (2006) 140 cal.app.4th 535, 553), and, because he objected below, we review his claim of evidentiary error for an abuse of discretion (people v. lawley (2002) 27 cal.4th 102, 153-154 (lawley)). a. aranda/bruton under aranda and brutonstatement that on its face also inculpates the defendant unless the codefendant testifies and submits to cross-examination. (people v. capistrano (2014) 59 cal.4th 830, 869; people v. hajek & vo (2014) 58 cal.4th 1144, 1176-1177 (hajek & vo); people v. montes (2014) 58 cal.4th 809, 867.) in crawford v. washington (2004) 541 u.s. 36, the united states supreme court narrowed the scope of the right to confrontation; it now bars only those out-of-opportunity for cross-examination. (id. at p. 68.) an out-of-court statement is people v. leon (2015) 61 cal.4th 569, 602-603, quoting people v. lopez (2012) 55 cal.4th 569, 581ablish or prove past events davis v. washington (2006) 547 u.s. 813, 822). by narrowing the right of confrontation generally, crawford also limited the right of confrontation protected by aranda/bruton: unless the cocrawford, its admission at a joint trial does not violate aranda/bruton. (people v. arceo (2011) 195 cal.app.4th 556, 571, citing united 15 states v. figueroa-cartagena (1st cir. 2010) 612 f.3d 69, 85; united states v. johnson (6th cir. 2009) 581 f.3d 320, 326.) -of-court statements is between private individuals are generally not formal or solemn enough to be considered investigation or prosecution of crime. (see hajek & vo, supra, 58 cal.4th at p. 1214 people v. cage (2007) 40 cal.4th 965, 989, fn. 20 [statements to private doctors not testimonial]; people v. blacksher (2011) 52 cal.4th 769, 817-818 [statements made to family members and was made to friends and acquaintances and made long before mackbee knew police had identified him as a suspect; the statements consequently lack the requisite formality and solemnity and were not made with the primary purpose of investigating or prosecuting crime. because they are not testimonial, aranda/bruton does not apply. b. statements against penal interest although the hearsay rule generally bars the admission of out-of-court statements for their truth (evid. code,  1200), one exception to this rule witness and the statement, when made, . . . so far subjected him to the risk of . . . criminal liability . . . that a reasonable man in his position would not have made the statement (1) people v. duarte (2000) 24 cal.4th 603, 610-611; lawley, supra, 27 cal.4th 102, 153.) to satisfy the third element, the statement -inculpatory, rather than merely [an] attempt[] to shift blame or curry duarte, at pp. 611-612, quoting williamson v. united states (1994) 512 u.s. 594, 603.) in making this inquiry, courts should consider not only what was said, but 16 duarte, at p. 614, quoting people v. cudjo (1993) 6 cal.4th 585, 607; lawley, at p. 153 [statement must be viewed to (duarte, at p. 612, quoting people v. leach (1975) 15 cal.3d 419, 441.) johnson concedes that mackbee was unavailable for cross-examination, but argues that mnot and that we disagree. in all three statements, mackbee states that he was also involved in the and in another mackbee takes credit for the shooting. each of the statements is nd its discretion in determining that the people satisfied the prerequisites for admitting c. harmlessness even if we assume there was some constitutional or evidentiary error, that error would be harmless under chapman v. california (1967) 386 u.s. 18, 24, or under people v. watson (1956) 46 cal.2d 818, 836-statements, repeated numerous times to numerous people, that he (johnson) was the shooter, and was thus involved in the robbery and/or shooting. v. cumulative error because we conclude there was only one error and reverse on that ground, we have no basis to reverse due to cumulative error. 17 disposition ons for first-degree murder. we reverse the judgment imposing a sentence of life without the possibility of parole, vacate the special circumstance finding and remand to the trial court so that the people may elect whether to retry the defendants on the special circumstance or to have the trial court resentence johnson and mackbee without the special circumstance finding. not to be published in the official reports. _______________________, j. hoffstadt we concur: _______________________, acting p.j. ashmann-gerst _______________________, j. chavez
