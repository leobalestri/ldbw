(a), counts 2, 4, 5, and 6); and second degree robbery ( 211, count 3). the information alleged baird had suffered a prior conviction for a serious or violent felony ( 667, subds. (a)(1) & (d), 1170.12, subd. (b)), had served multiple prior prison terms within the meaning of section 667.5, subdivision (b), and had been released on bail when he committed some of the offenses ( 12022.1).3 at the time of some or all of the offenses, baird was on probation on another case, no. ba425387. on october 29, 2015, baird was convicted of grand theft and second degree commercial burglary in case no. ga096926. on july 27, 2016, he was sentenced to a term of two years in prison on that matter.4 on december 14, 2016, pursuant to a negotiated disposition, baird pleaded no contest in the consolidated case, no. va141348, pursuant to people v. west,5 to three counts of grand theft of personal property (counts 2, 4, and 6). baird stipulated that the value of the loss in each count was greater than $950. in accordance with the negotiated disposition, the 3 s to counts 1 and 2; the section 667, subdivision (a)(1) serious felony enhancement as to count 3; the section 12022.1 on bail enhancement as to counts 3, 4, and 5; four section 667.5, subdivision (b) prior prison term enhancements as to counts 1 and 2; and six section 667.5, subdivision (b) prior prison term enhancements as to counts 3, 4, 5, and 6. 4 the abstract of judgment in case no. ga096926. (see evid. code,  452, 459.) 5 people v. west (1970) 3 cal.3d 595. 4 trial court sentenced baird to the upper term of three years on count 2, plus one-third the midterm (eight months), on counts 4 and 6, each to be served consecutively to the sentence on count 2, for a total sentence of 4 years 4 months. baird admitted violating probation in case no. ba425387, and the court imposed a consecutive eight-month sentence on that matter, with credit for 248 days time served. counts 1, 3, and 5 and the remaining allegations were dismissed pursuant to the plea agreement. the court imposed a restitution fine, a suspended parole revocation restitution fine, a court operations assessment, a criminal conviction assessment, a penalty assessment, and a crime prevention fine. baird timely appealed.6 discussion baird contends that, because the trial court failed to expressly state whether his sentence in the instant matter should run concurrently or consecutively to the sentence imposed in case no. ga096926, by operation of law the two sentences must run concurrently. we agree. section 669 requires the trial court to specify whether the terms of imprisonment for multiple offenses are to be served concurrently or consecutively. it provides in pertinent part: when a person is convicted of two or more crimes, whether in the same proceeding or court or in different proceedings or courts, and whether by judgment rendered by the same judge or by 6 probable cause. however, a certificate was not required here agreement, and does not attack the validity of the plea. (see  1237.5; people v. shelton (2006) 37 cal.4th 759, 766; people v. williams (2007) 156 cal.app.4th 898, 910.) 5 different judges, the second or other subsequent judgment upon which sentence is ordered to be executed shall direct whether the terms of imprisonment or any of them to which he or she is sentenced shall run concurrently or consecutively. . . . [] (b) in the event that the court at the time of pronouncing the second or other judgment upon that person had no knowledge of a prior existing judgment or judgments, or having knowledge, fails to determine how the terms of imprisonment shall run in relation to each other, then, upon that failure to determine, or upon that prior judgment or judgments being brought to the attention of the court at any time prior to the expiration of 60 days from and after the actual commencement of imprisonment upon the second or other subsequent judgments, the court shall, in the absence of the defendant and within 60 days of the notice, determine how the term of imprisonment upon the second or other subsequent judgment shall run with reference to the prior incompleted term or terms of imprisonment. upon the failure of the court to determine how the terms of imprisonment on the second or subsequent judgment shall run, the term of imprisonment on the second or subsequent judgment shall run section 669 thus that when a person has been convicted of two or more offenses (whether in the same or separate proceedings), the court must decide whether the terms are to run concurrently or consecutively. if the court fails to direct how the terms are to run, they must be served (people v. black (2007) 41 cal.4th 799, 820-821.) the requirement that concurrent sentences be imposed is a default in the event the court fails to exercise its discretion. (id. at p. 822.) here, the trial court failed to specify whether the sentence in the instant matter, case no. va141348, was to run 6 consecutively or concurrently to that in case no. ga096926. or abstract of judgment, referenced case no. ga096926. the record does not suggest that the omission was brought to the thereafter, or that the court ever exercised its discretion on the question. became a concurrent sentence by operatiopeople v. bruner (1995) 9 cal.4th 1178, 1181-1182; in re joyner (1989) 48 cal.3d 487, 490; people v. kading (1988) 204 cal.app.3d 1500, 1503, fn. 2; people v. lepe (1987) 195 cal.app.3d 1347, 1350 [trial court has discretion to determine whether multiple sentences are to run concurrently or consecutively, bsentence . . . will be imposed as a matter of law if the court fails to determine how the terms of imprisonment will run in relation in re jiminez (1985) 166 cal.app.3d 686, 690 [subsequent judgments are deemed to run concurrently if the court neglects to state the manner in which the sentences are to be served at the time it pronounces the second judgment].) the people argue that unaware of [the] prior case, appellant is not entitled to invoke the the argument is both factually and legally incorrect. the record suggests the trial court was indeed aware of the other case. the information stated that at the time of the from custody on bail or own recognizance in case number ga096926 within the meaning at a june 22, 2016, hearing, the trial court stated, during a that reminds me. people, this gentleman is has a public defender on one 7 [no.] ga096926[.] two days before baird entered his plea, when [a]ny court will calculate your credit, they will say he was a sentenced prisoner (italics added.) when taking deputy district attorney told bairdcredit in this case for from january 14th through july 14th, ga case that is not befor in any event, section 669 applies where a trial court is unaware of the earlier case. sentencing court to specify at the time of judgment whether a defendant convicted of two or more crimes will serve his terms concurrently or consecutively. that decision . . . may be rendered if either (1) the sentencing courts did not know of a prior existing judgment or (2) fails to determine how the terms of imprisonment shall run. if no in re calhoun (1976) 17 cal.3d 75, 79-80, fns. omitted, italics added.) thus, assuming arguendo the trial court was unaware baird had been sentenced in the earlier case, that circumstance is of no moment. in sum, because the trial court did not specify whether the terms in case nos. va141348 and ga096926 were to be served concurrently or consecutively, the sentences must run concurrently by operation of law. we order the abstract of judgment modified accordingly. 8 disposition the trial court is directed to correct the minute order and abstract of judgment to indicate that the sentence in the instant matter is to run concurrently with the sentence in case no. ga096926. the clerk of the superior court is directed to forward a copy of the modified abstract of judgment to the department of corrections and rehabilitation. in all other respects, the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports dhanidina, j. we concur: edmon, p. j. lavin, j. judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
