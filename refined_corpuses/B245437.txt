[] . . . my suspicion was further raised by the identification, for the first time, in the middle of trial that there was an in-custody witness[, mr. campbell,] who could corroborate the defenda] . . . that based on these suspicions, i believed that the defendant -custody witness details which would support his lies.mr. avila also describedetermine if there were any contact phone numbers which could be associated with this surprise witness (who was identified in-court only when he was due to enter a time-served plea on a narcotics case in the building, but in a different court room). [] . . . that i further requested documents which would support my suspicion that the defendant was concocting his elaborate the following morning, thursday, october 18, 2012, mr. avila advised the court the documents found. mr. avila ppear to be - - well, the transcript of the preliminary hearing. there are some [handwritten] notes made on 6 -minute witness, mr. campbell. mr. avila [] i am seeking to admit the preliminary hearing transcript to show that it was available to him coincident with the notes that he has, which are very detailed with regard mr. avila which talk about the details of his testimony, essentially. he lays out in a grid - - admit the preliminary hearing transcript. mr. avila wanted to show defendant possessed the preliminary hearing transcript when the notes at issue were prepared. the trial court denied that request stating it did not want the jury reading the entire preliminary hearing transcript. the trial court asked mr. avila to identify any substantial variance between the facts as set forth in defenda trial testimony. the trial court found there was no substantial inconsistency warranting introduction for impeachment purposes. moreover, particularly in view of the belated discovery of the notes, the trial court was disinclined to allow impeachment on insubstantial inconsistencies. the trial court formally ruled no evidence based on the documents found mr. avila resumed cross-examining defendant-examination avila made no attempt to impeach defendant with any statements made or facts set forth in the documents recovered in the jail cell search. on monday, october 22, 2012, four days after she was apprised of the seizure of the papers, d stand on cross-examination, and that search did not appear to serve any legitimate purpose. it was ordered by mr. avila and conducted by the sheriffs, and it resulted in the under the fourth and sixth amendment[s]. the documents that were recovered all fall within the attorney-client privilege category. they were notes on the back of motions 7 that i had given him, notes regarding his testimony, notes regarding his case, notes that were intended for me. [] the government has obtained and read these privileged documents. that means there was a deliberate piercing of the attorney-client privilege the trial court advised the parties to prepare a formal motion. the jury reached its verdicts on october 23, 2012. on november 19, 2012, defendant filed a motion to dismiss or for a new trial. in support of the motion, ms. me a folder of notes he took regarding his testimony in this matter so that i may review them. i did review these notes and handed them back to [defendant]. [] . . . [o]n the morning of october 18th i was handed a folder by deputy district attorney lou avila containing copies of these same notes. mr. avila advised me that the notes had been recovered when [defen] . . . mr. avila defendant argued: the notes in question were attorney-client privileged; the prosecution-client privilege warranted dismissal or a new trial; the prosecution had not shown an absence of prejudice to defendant; and fifth and sixth amendment rights had been violated. defendant presented no evidence mr. avila had any knowledge the notes seized from the jail cell had previously been shown to ms. brown. in his opposition, mr. avila argued there had been no misconduct and no prejudice to defendant. mr. avila declared, . . . this request was , the trial court de motion to dismiss or for a new trial. the trial the a november 21, 2012 minute order states, he documents in the trial, the court found that th[ere] was no 8 3. analysis on appeal, defendant asserts a violation of his federal sixth amendment right to ental right to counsel is guaranteed by the sixth amendment to the united states constitution. (gideon v. wainwright (1963) 372 u.s. 335, 339-345; people v. alexander (2010) 49 cal.4th 846, 887; barber v. municipal court (1979) 24 cal.3d 742, 750.) this right includes the right to effective assistance of counsel in the preparation and trial of the defense case. (powell v. alabama (1932) 287 u.s. 45, 71; barber v. municipal court, supra, 24 cal.3d at p. 750; people v. douglas (1964) 61 cal.2d 430, 434.) a defense attorney must carefully investigate all potential defenses of fact or law. (barber v. municipal court, supra, 24 cal.3d at p. 751; people v. ibarra (1963) 60 cal.2d 460, 464, disapproved on another point in people v. pope (1979) 23 cal.3d 412, 425.) to that end, the accused must be assured of the confidentiality and privacy of his or her communications with counsel including as to facts concerning the charged acts. (barber v. municipal court, supra, 24 cal.3d at p. 751; in re jordan (1972) 7 cal.3d 930, 941.) no federal constitutional provision including the sixth amendment specifically establishes an attorney-client communication privilege. (howell v. trammell (10th cir. 2013) 728 f.3d 1202, 1222; people v. alexander, supra, 49 cal.4th at pp. 887-888.) but, as our supreme court has held, the right to confidential communication between a defendant and his or her attorney of the right to assistance of counsel. (people v. alexander, supra, 49 cal.4th at p. 888.) ordinarily, we rdismissal or new trial motion for an abuse of discretion. (people v. thompson (2010) 49 cal.4th 79, 140; people v. guerra (2006) 37 cal.4th 1067, 1159, disapproved on another point in people v. rundle (2008) 43 cal.4th 76, 151.) however, wsixth amendment grounds. (see people v. alexander, supra, 49 cal.4th at pp. 887, 889; people v. zapien (1993) 4 cal.4th 929, 966-968.) 9 is on the prosecutor to prove non-use of [the intercepted] documents were admitted against [defendant] at his trial, and no questions directly asked regarding the contents in the materials[.] defendant argues there was prejudice, however, prepare his cross-examination of [defendant] or his closing argumentsconcludes: in order to prepare his cross-examination of [defendant]. . . . [i]t is virtually impossible - we assume that, as the trial court found, the documents in question were privileged. the documents were shown to and reviewed by ms. brown. (see evid. code,  952; people v. alexander, supra, 49 cal.4th at p. 887.) our supreme court has not decided who bears the burden of proving or disproving injury to the defendant or benefit to the state upon a violation of the constitutional right to counsel. (people v. alexander, supra, 49 cal.4th at p. 889, fn. 23; people v. ervine (2009) 47 cal.4th 745, 768, fn. 11.) the ninth circuit has held that once a prima facie case of government intrusion has been established, the prosecutor bears the burden of proving no prejudice to the defendant. (u.s. v. danielson (9th cir. 2003) 325 f.3d 1054, 1059, 1071; see people v. alexander, supra, 49 cal.4th at p. 889, fn. 23.) we presume for the purposes of discussion the ninth circuit analysis correctly allocates the burden on the prosecution to there is no per se rule requiring reversal of a conviction when the prosecution acquires knowledge of defense strategy. (weatherford v. bursey (1977) 429 u.s. 545, 549; people v. alexander, supra, 49 cal.4th at p. 888.) moreover, where there is no realistic possibility of injury to the defendant or prosecutorial benefit, there is no violation of the sixth amendment right to counsel. (weatherford v. bursey, supra, 429 u.s. at pp. 558-559; people v. alexander, supra, 49 cal.4th at pp. 888-889; people v. 10 ervine, supra, 47 cal.4th at p. 764; see u.s. v. danielson, supra, 325 f.3d at p. 1069.) we turn to the facts of the present case to determine whether there was any realistic possibility of injury to defendant or benefit to the prosecution. the prosecution did not benefit . (see evid. code,  952; people v. alexander, supra, 49 cal.4th at p. 887.) mr. avila declared he did not use the s own testimony was consistent with the facts set forth in his notes. further, until late in the trial. this occurred cross-examination of defendant was nearing completion. moreover, both defendant and his trial counsel, ms. brown, knew the contents of his notes. but, defendant has not identified any specific evidence offered by the prosecution or argument made to the jury that he contends arose from the intercepted notes. (people v. alexander, supra, 49 cal.4th at p. 889; see weatherford v. bursey, supra, 429 u.s. at pp. 547-549.) nor is there any evidence the attorney-client relationship. ms. succinct declaration never states the discovery of the notes interfered with her ability to provide a defense. (compare, e.g., barber v. municipal court, supra, 24 cal.3d at p. 756; 5 witkin & epstein cal. criminal law (4th ed. 2012) criminal trial,  276, pp. 460-461.) we have read entire record on appeal. we find no basis for concluding there was a reasonable possibility of prejudice to defendant or prosecutorial benefit. b. failure to instruct mr. campbell, a key defense witness, appeared at trial in handcuffs. defendant argues it was reversible error to not sua sponte instruct the jury that being in physical restraints should have no bearing on the guilt determination. defendant contend[the instructional error sixth amendment rights to a fair trial and to present a defense, [therefore] the judgment must be reversed unless it is 11 mr. campbell was a crucial witness. in addition, during closing arguments, mr. avila repeatedly referred to the fact that mr. campbell was in custody. further, reference was multiple felony convictions. finally, mr. avila noted mr. campbell appeared in handcuffs. those comments. as noted above, mr. campbell in part. mr. campbell was in custody at the time he testified. he appeared in jail attire and in commented: testimony, mr. avila requested instruction with calcrim no. 337 because mr. ms. brown agreed. the discussion that followed ] the court: 337? [] ms. brown: yeah. witness restrained. [] the court: let me take a look at it. . . . . [] . . . [] the court: which one? a or b? [] ms. brown: b. [] the court: okay. yeah, it would bo alternative b.2 physically restrained. do not speculate about the reason. you must completely disregard this circumstance in deciding the issues in this case. do not consider it for any purpose he (brackets omitted.) calcrim no. 337, alternative b stified, [he was] in custody. do not speculate about the reason. the fact that a witness is in custody does not by itself make a witness more or 2 the jury was instructed: he reason. the fact that a witness is in custody does not by itself 12 (brackets omitted.) the attorney general concedes that it was error to not sua sponte instruct the jury with calcrim no. 337, alternative a, as required by people v. duran (1976) 16 cal.3d 282, 288, footnote 4, and 291-292. (see people v. lopez (2013) 56 cal.4th 1028, 1080.) the attorney general contends, however, that defense counsel invited the error by requesting instruction with calcrim no. 337, alternative b. we disagree with the attorney general. defendant from challenging a jury instruction given by the trial court when the defendant (people v. harris (2008) 43 cal.4th 1269, 1293; accord, people v. dehoyos (2013) 57 cal.4th 79, 138.) on the record before us, it cannot be said that ms. brown acted deliberately and expressed a clear preference for alternative b over alternative a. it appears instead that both the trial court and defense counsel erred in selecting alternative b. in the discussion about calcrim no. 337, both mr. avila and ms. brown specifically referred to the fact that mr. campbell was physically restrained. alternative a, not alternative b, references a witness who was physically restrained. therefore, we do not conclude ms. brown invited the error. we review the instructional error for prejudice. (people v. wilson (2008) 43 cal.4th 1, 19-20; people v. carpenter (1997) 15 cal.4th 312, 393.) we consider whether it is reasonably probable the jury would have reached verdicts more favorable to defendant had it been instructed with calcrim no. 337, alternative a. (ibid.; see cal. const., art. vi,  13.) the jury was aware that mr. campbell was in custody when he testified. the jury was instructed that fact did not make mr. campbell more or less witness. the failure to additionally instruct the jury to disregard the fact mr. campbell was in handcuffs was not prejudicial. the physical restraint was but a manifestation of 13 favorable to defendant had the jury been instructed with calcrim no. 337, alternative a. c. abstract of judgment the parties agree that the abstract of judgment must be amended to reflect the actual sentence imposed. (people v. jones (2012) 54 cal.4th 1, 88; people v. boyde (1988) 46 cal.3d 212, 256.) the abstract of judgment must be amended to show: concurrent sentences on counts 1 and 2 rather than section 654, subdivision (a) stays; $120 in court operations assessments ( 1465.8, subd.
