[ . . . [] but when detective fernandez asked defendant whether he had touched t.defendant suggested it was not that further t.t. oral sex in the house. but he denied that t. gave him oral sex. then toward the end of the second interview, detective fernandez asked defendant, what he would say to t. if h 3 further statements defendant made during the first interview are discussed in connection with the motion to suppress, post. 5 b. defense case defendant testified on his own behalf as follows: defendant first met t. when she was eight or nine years old. he thought of her as a daughter and called her daughter. he also thought of her old brother and sister as his children. during the first interview with detective fernandez, the detective was of mexico. at some point during that first interview, which lasted about an hour, the detective informed defendant about t.had raped her and had sex with her. according to defendant, those allegations were lies and he explained that to detective fernandez. prior to the first interview, defendant had a discussion with t. about school. t.brother and sister also participated in the discussion. defendant told t. that because her brother, who was paying for t.needed to determine how t.t. she was not paying attention to her studies because she had a boyfriend. but t. denied having a boyfriend. later that same evening, t.t. had lied about not having a boyfriend and that the boyfriend would come to the house to see her. when defendant and t.outside to discuss the matter, t. and her sister, who had overheard defendant talking to her brother, left the house and did not return that night. during the first interview with detective fernandez, defendant told him more than once that t.began to feel uncomfortable. when the detective would not allow defendant to participate in the discussion, and instead kept talking, defendant felt as if he was being accused of something he did not do. defendant began to feel as if he should confess to 6 something because the detective told him the detective had experience in these types of cases and had written several books. at some point, defendant told the detective he wanted to return to his cell. between the first and second interviews, detective fernandez spoke to defendant what t. was saying, but defendant protested that he had not done anything. based on the uld detain e. and t.agreed to sign what the detective wanted him to sign so that nothing would happen to t. defendant agreed. when defendant subsequently admitted to certain things in the second interview, such as touching t. not think those admissions would result in criminal charges because he believed a physical examination of t. would show she was lying. defendant denied ever giving t. oral sex, touching her vagina with his penis, or putting his penis inside her vagina. defendant also denied ever being alone with t. on saturdays and was convinced that eventually t. would tell the truth. c. rebuttal during the first interview, the detective explained to defendant that he had no power to file any charges against defendant and that he just investigated and wrote reports in cases. he also explained to defendant that only the district attorney had the power to file charges against defendant. in addition, detective fernandez informed defendant that he had no power to offer defendant any type of leniency. 7 detective fernandez denied that he had an unrecorded interview with defendant between the first and second recorded interviews and confirmed that he did not speak with defendant at all between those interviews. the detective had no animosity toward according to the detective, it was not his practice to ask suspects for written confessions. but if a suspect offered to sign a written confession, the detective would procedural background in an amended information, the los angeles county district attorney charged defendant in counts 1 through 12 with aggravated sexual assault of a child in violation of penal code section 269, subdivision (a)(1)4, and alleged that defendant, who was seven or more years older than the victim, t., raped her when she was under the age of 14 years. in counts 13 and 14, the district attorney charged defendant with forcible rape in violation of section 261, subdivision (a)(1). defendant pleaded not guilty. defendant moved pursuant to section 1118 to dismiss counts 1 and 2 and the trial court granted that motion. following trial, the jury found defendant guilty on the ten remaining aggravated sexual assault counts and the two rape counts. at the sentencing hearing, the trial court sentenced defendant to ten consecutive 15-years-to-life sentences on the aggravated sexual assault counts and two consecutive six-year middle term sentences on the two rape counts, for an aggregate sentence of 162 years-to-life. 4 all further statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise indicated. 8 discussion a. motion to suppress defendant contends that during the first interview with detective fernandez, he unambiguously invoked his fifth amendment right to remain silent. according to defendant, because he exercised his right to remain silent, any statements he made during the second interview were inadmissible. 1. background prior to trial, defendant moved to suppress the recording and transcript of his second interview with detective fernandez. in support of that motion, defendant specified three separate statements he made during the first interview with the detective as the factual predicate for the motion.5 defendant made the first statement following these comments by detective derstand why those things occur? i know that in that culture ofof being mexicans, a person that does those things is seen know how to show the affection, the love to the children. to theto the young ladies. the only way they know to do it is showing them physical attention. that occurs. there was not where you tied her up and left her locked up in a room and just had sex with her whenever you wanted without feeding her. no. she had a free life. and there was some circumstances where she took advantage of the sex and asked you for things in exchange for sex. those things 5 to the extent that defendant is asserting additional statements he made in the first interview as support for his contentions on appeal, he forfeited any contention based on such statements by failing to raise them in the trial court. (people v. simon (2001) 25 cal.4th 1082, 1097, fn. 9.) 9 in response, defendant made the first statement on which he relied in the trial -huh. i understand, i understand, i understand. there are many things that are going through your head. the damagethe damage is already done. now, if you want to continue doing her more damage, because if you tell me that nothingi have to go and interview her again because why is she lying. do you remember that i told you that you are just as important [as] she is? i have to give the same credence to you that i give to her. i have eak with t. yes, i would like that you talk with her so that she [u/i] end to deceive. and already, and with all respect there mustwell, if that supposedly says that she is pregnant fromfrom methatthat ment, detective fernandez stated as follows: litigator, you were an evidence against you. okay. right now the only thatwhat you also attempt is i have the statement of many people. only yours is missing.

[detective]: uh-huh. that you told her thatthat you wanted a 2. standard of review miranda disputed facts and inferences and its evaluations of credibility, if supported by substantial evidence, and we independently determine, from the undisputed facts and facts properly found by the trial court, whether the challenged statement was illegally obtained. (people v. gonzalez (2005) 34 cal.4th 1111, 1125 [23 cal.rptr.3d 295, 104 p.3d 98].) [if] what [the] defendant . . . said during his police interview is undisputed, we engage in a de novo review of the legal question of whether the statement at issue was ambiguous or people v. bacon (2010) 50 cal.4th 1082, 1105.) 11 3. applicable law e against self-incrimination, the united states supreme court, in miranda, required law enforcement agencies to advise a suspect, before any custodial law enforcement against him in a court of law, that he has the right to the presence of an attorney, and that if he cannot afford an attorney one will be appointed for him prior to any questioning if miranda, supra, 384 u.s. 436, 479; see connecticut v. barrett (1987) 479 u.s. 523, 528 [93 l.ed.2d 920, 107 s.ct. 828].) if the suspect knowingly and intelligently waives these rights, law enforcement may interrogate, but if at any point in the interview he invokes the right to remain silent or the right to cmiranda, at p. 474; see id. at pp. 444-445, 473-(people v. martinez (2010) 47 cal.4th 911, 947.) davis v. u.s.

[] several cases involve statements interpreted as a refusal to answer specific questions or go into further detail, an unwillingness to be questioned by a particular officer, or an attempt to alter the course of questioning rather than terminate it. (see people v. hayes, 38 cal.3d 780, 783, 214 cal.rptr. 652, 699 p.2d 1259 (1985) people v. silva subject rather than an invocation); people v. jennings, 46 cal.3d 963, 979, 251 cal.rptr. 278, 760 p.2d 475 expressions of frustration with interviewing officer rather than invocation); people v. ashmus, 54 cal.3d 932, 969, 2 cal.rptr. 2d 112, 820 p.2d 214 (1991) (no invocation where suspect sought to alter the course of questioning when incriminating witness was people v. musselwhite, 17 cal.4th 1216, 1238, 74 cal.rptr.2d 212, 954 p.2d 475 (1998), a specific topic, not an invocation); people v. castille, 129 cal.app.4th 863, 885, 29 cal.rptr.3d 71 (1st dist. 2005) (no invocation where murder suspect hesitated and asked, as he was about to describe seeing the victim after the shooting); people v. vance, 188 cal.app.4th 1182, 1211, 116 cal.rptr.3d 98 sechrest v. ignacio, 549 f.3d 789, 806 (9th cir. 2008) properly continued a(2012 ed.)  8:18, pp. 213-214.) 14 4. analysis to remain silent. the did not want to talk about t. having sex in exchange for favors or about the violent sex the detective was describing. moreover, following that statement, defendant engaged the detective by suggesting that the detective should speak with t. again and by denying that he impregnated t. thus, in that specific context, a reasonable police investigator would not have understood that defendant wanted to terminate the interview and exercise his right to remain silent. atat nstatements about his work schedule, the second statement appears to be an explanation of why he could not have been having sex with t. everyday as she claimed, i.e., he worked nights and when he came home, his wife was always there. it therefore could be reasonably interpreted as a denial of t.unambiguous request to terminate the interview. was mentally abusing t. when the detective suggested that defendant was mentally abusing t. by denying her allegations, defendant responded in the negative were. when the detective again impwhen the subject turned to t.position could have concluded that defendant was not expressing a desire to end the interview, but rather was refusing to explain further a specific subject matter. 15 b. jury instruction on lesser included offense defendant contends that the trial court committed prejudicial error when it failed to instruct the jury sua sponte on lesser included offenses of rape. according to defendant, his admissions in the second interview of sexual contact with t., but not sexual intercourse, supported a reasonable inference that he could only be guilty of assault and battery. (people v. horning (2004) 34 cal.4th 871, 904-905 [22 cal.rptr.3d 305, 102 p.3d 228] (horning); see people v. valdez (2004) 32 cal.4th 73, 115 [8 cal.rptr.3d 271, 82 p.3d instruct on mere defenses, people v. breverman people v. beames (2007) 40 cal.4th 90lesser included offense where no evidence supports a finding that the offense was anything less than the crime charged.

(people v. cole (2004) 33 cal.4th 1158, 1218.) -serving admissions that he had sexual contact with t., but no intercourse, did not support a reasonable inference that he committed only assault and battery, not aggravated sexual assault or rape. t. testified that defendant had sexual intercourse with her weekly from the time she was nine until she turned 15. in response to those accusation, defendant initially denied them outright and then made the admissions on which he relies. at trial, however, he again denied having any sexual contact with t. given his denials and t. 16 second interview were not credible or reasonable. therefore, they were insufficient to support a sua sponte instruction on the lesser included offenses of assault and battery. c. cumulative error defendant contends that even assuming the two errors of which he complains were harmless individually, the cumulative effect of those errors prejudiced his right to a fair trial. because we have concluded that the trial court did not err as defendant contends, there was no cumulative error. disposition the judgment of conviction is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports mosk, acting p.j. we concur: kriegler, j. ________________________ judge of the ventura superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
