(a)) and sentenced to 25 years-to-life under the three strikes law (former pen. code,  1170.12, subd. (c)(2).)1 in november 2012, california voters enacted proposition 36 (the three strikes reform act of 2012). as a general rule, under the three strikes law as amended. a defendant with two prior serious or violent felony convictions who is convicted of a third felony that is non-serious and non-violent will no longer automatically face an 1 all statutory references are to the penal code. 3 indeterminate term of 25 years to life in prison. ( 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(c).)2 instead, these offenders will be given the same sentence as offenders with two strikes under the former law. proposition 36 also provides a procedure by which a person presently serving an indeterminate life sentence imposed pursuant to the former three strikes law may petition to have that sentence recalled and to be resentenced as a second-strike offender if the current offense is not a serious or violent felony and the person is not otherwise disqualified. ( 1170.126, subd. (e)(3).) a person is disqualified if, among other things, the person has a prior conviction of murder. ( 1170.126, subd. (e)(3), 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(c)(iv)(iv).) even if the person is not otherwise disqualified, the court may deny the petition if it determines that a reduced sentence would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. ( 1170.126, subd. (g)(3).) accordingly, resentencing under section 1170.126 is discretionary even if the offender meets the objective criteria set out in section 1170.126, subdivision (e). in may 2013, ashanti petitioned for a reduction of his 25 years-to-life sentence under section 1170.126. the trial court denied the petition on the ground that ashantiprior murder conviction made him ineligible for resentencing under sections 1170.126, subdivision (e)(3) and 1170.12, subdivision (c)(2)(c)(iv)(iv). ashanti filed a timely appeal.3 we appointed counsel to represent ashanti on appeal. after examining the record, wende 2 even if the current felony is not serious or violent,still serve an indeterminate term of 25 years-to-life if any of the following is true: (1) the felony is a sex offense or requires registering as a sex offender; (3) the current felony was completed while armed with a firearm or with intent to cause great bodily injury; or (4) any of the prior felony convictions is for a crime listed in section 1170.12, subdivision (c)(2)(c)(iv). ( 1170.126, subd. (e)(3).) 3 the question whether a defendant has the right to appeal the denial of a petition under section 1170.126 when the trial court determined that he did not meet the threshold eligibility requirements for resentencing is currently pending before our supreme court. (teal v. superior court, review granted july 31, 2013, s211708.) claims are reviewable through his writ petitions. 4 review the record. (people v. wende (1979) 25 cal.3d 436.) we directed appointed counsel to immediately send the record on appeal and a copy of the opening brief to ashanti and we notified him that within 30 days from the date of the notice he could submit by brief or letter any grounds of appeal, contentions or arguments he wished us to consider. ashanti filed two supplemental briefs. he does not deny that he is ineligible for resentencing under section 1170.126 because of his prior murder conviction but raises jurisdictional and constitutional issues that we discuss below. discussion a. the appeal we have examined the entire record and are satisfied that attorney has fully complied with his responsibilities and that no arguable issue exists. (people v. wende, supra, 25 cal.3d at p. 441.) we respond below to the issues raised by ashanti in his supplemental briefs and writ petitions. b. the writ petitions 1. jurisdiction ashanti argues that his joy riding conviction should be overturned because his trial took place before a judge who normally hears civil cases and in a courtroom in the stanley mosk courthouse where civil trials are normally held instead of in the clara shortridge foltz courthouse where criminal trials are normally held. he cites section 681 which states: legal conviction in a court having jurisdiction thereandrews v. superior court (1946) 29 cal.2d 208, 213, which held that the then-existing police courts did not have jurisdiction to enforce juvenile court law. andrews does not apply here because ashanti is not a juvenile and police courts no longer exist in california. article vi of the california constitution provides that our supreme court has interpreted this provision that jurisdiction is vested by the constitution in the court and not in any 5 particular judge or department thereof; and that whether sitting separately or together, the judges hold but one and the same court. (people v. konow (2004) 32 cal.4th 995, 1018.) under rule 10.950 of the california rules of court, the presiding hear criminal cases. (cal. rules of court, rule 10.951(d).) this is apparently what 2. double jeopardy ashanti next argues that barring him from resentencing under proposition 36 because of his prior murder conviction violates the double jeopardy clauses of the california and united states constitutions because it punishes him a second time for the murder he committed as a juvenile. ashanti is correct in his assertion that the double jeopardy clause protects against multiple punishments for the same offense. (north carolina v. pearce (1969) 395 u.s. 711, 717.) the flaw in his argument is that he is not being punished again for his 1980 murder conviction. he is being punished for the vehicle code violation he committed 16 years later. (people v. white eagle (1996) 48 cal.app.4th 1511, 1519-1520.) his ineligibility for resentencing under proposition 36 homicide. 3. equal protection ashanti contends california has no rational basis for excluding persons serving current prison terms for non-serious, non-violent crimes solely because of their prior convictions of murder or certain other serious or violent felonies. we disagree. the decision to treat crimes distinctly as to sentencing consequences generally does not violate equal protection of the law. (see, e.g., people v. floyd (2003) 31 cal.4th 179, 188 [treating those convicted of drug offenses differently based on the date of their conviction does not entail an equal protection violation].) the classifications drawn by proposition 36 decrease the likelihood that the offenders whose sentences are reduced or 6 who are released due to its provisions will pose an unreasonable risk of danger to the public. (people v. yearwood (2013) 213 cal.app.4th 161, 179; see people v. edwards (2002) 97 cal.app.4th 161, 164- offenders].) furthermore, denying the possibility of resentencing to offenders with prior murder convictions is rationally related to the legitimate public objective of discouraging recidivism. (see people v. kilborn (1996) 41 cal.app.4th 1325, 1329 [one purpose of the three strikes law is to reduce recidivism].) 4. due process finally, ashanti argues the exclusion of offenders with prior convictions for murder violates substantive due process because there is no rational basis to exclude such offenders from possible resentencing because the trial court can weed out those who pose an unreasonably high risk to the public through the criteria of section 1170.126, subdivision (f). but, as we explained above, the state has a rational basis for excluding offenders with prior murder convictions from being considered for resentencing under the discretionary criteria of subdivision (f). 7 disposition petitions for a writ of habeas corpus and mandate are denied. not to be published. rothschild, p. j. we concur: chaney, j. miller, j. judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
