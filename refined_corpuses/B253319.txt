(a)). the matter proceeded to trial by jury, and the jury found defendant guilty. defendant thereafter admitted his prior felony conviction. prior to sentencing, defendant moved the court to strike (that is, to dismiss) his 2011 prior strike conviction. specifically, defendant argued that he was outside the spirit of the three strikes law because (1) his prior robbery conviction was more of ; (2) he his love for a prior public defender, accusing his mother of killing his grandmother, and believing that he was a gang member due to a photograph of himself as an infant throwing what he perceived to be a gang sign) and unusual behavior (such as sleeping on the floor, pacing around the house, sitting on the roof). as proof of these facts, defendant relied upon the trial testimony of his mother and himself as well as declarations from his mother, his counsel, a person from the national alliance on mental illness indicating that defendant had mental illness related psychosis,tors at a religious school. in an oral ruling from the bench and a subsequently entered written order, the trial court denied de the court recognized its task was to decide if defendant fell e . . . spirit of the three strikes law, and proceeded to strike, background, character, and prospects. conviction although the robbery conviction 4 was based on , the court considered the probation and imposed prison time. what is more, notwithstanding even though defendant had been imprisoned and placed on parole. next, the court noted that the current burglary involved ause defendant was unarmed and did not confront or anyone, is still lastly, the court er, and prospects. the and did not in any event show that defendant was troubled to the extent lly mitigating circum the court found [] defendant committed his crimes despite the court sentenced defendant to 13 years in state prison. the court imposed a base sentence of eight years (four years, doubled due to the prior strike), plus an additional five years for the prior serious felony conviction. defendant filed this timely appeal. discussion defendant argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion to strike the allegation that his 2011 robbery conviction constitutes a strike within the meaning of our three strikes law. a trial court has the discretion to grant a motion to dismiss a strike allegation. ( 1385, subd. (a); people v. williams (1998) 17 cal.4th 148, 162.) in deciding whether to exercise that 5 discreand prior serious and/or violent felony convictions, and the particulars of his background, character, and prospects, the spirit, in whole or in part, and hence should be treated as though he had not previously been convicted of one or more serious and/or violent felonies.people v. carmony (2004) 33 cal.4th 367, 377 (carmony).) abuse of discretion. (carmony, supra, 33 cal.4th at p. 373.) where the record demonstrates that the trial court balanced the relevant factors and reached an impartial decision in conformity if we might have ruled differently in the first instance. (people v. myers (1999) 69 cal.app.4th 305, 310 (myers).) the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying ly exercised its discretion in denying the motion. on appeal, defendant urges that the trial court erred because it did not give sufficient weight to the minor nature of his 2011 robbery conviction, to the absence of aggravating factors underlying the current crime, to his mental illness, to his supportive family, or his young age, or to the fact that he would still serve a nine-year sentence without the strike. because the trial court considered all of these factors, defendant is effectively asking us to reweigh these factors and come to a different conclusion. this we cannot do. (myers, supra, 69 cal.app.4th at pp. 309-might disagree about whether to strike one or more of [a prior convictions 6 defendant also cites people v. banks (1997) 59 cal.app.4th 20, in re saldana (1997) 57 cal.app.4th 620, and people v. bishop (1997) 56 cal.app.4th 1245. but all three cases are distinguishable: banks reversed the denial of a motion to strike because the trial court misunderstood that it had discretion to grant relief (banks, at pp. 23-24), and in re saldana and bishop affirmed the grant of a motion to strike (in re saldana, at pp. 626-627; bishop, at pp. 1248-1251). if anything, these cases emphasize the limited nature of our review when a trial court exercises its discretion. given those limits, we have no disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. ______________________, j. hoffstadt we concur: _________________________, acting p. j. ashmann-gerst _________________________, j. chavez
