[] . . . [] i think they have some value, they are no longer discussion section 1202.4in every case in which a victim has suffered economic loss as a result of the defendants conduct, the court shall require that the defendant make restitution to the victim or victims in an amount established by court order, based on the amount of loss claimed by the victim or victims or any other showing to the court.shall be of a dollar amount that is sufficient to fully reimburse the victim or victims for every determined economic loss incurred as the result of the defendants criminal conduct1202.4, subd. (f)(3).) a defendant has the right to a hearing before a judge to dispute the determination of the amount of restitution. ( 1202.4, subd. (f)(a victim restitution hearing, a prima facie case for restitution is made by the people based in part on a victims testimony on, or other claim or statement of, the amount of his or her economic loss.(people v. millard (2009) 175 cal.app.4th 7, 26.) the burden then shifts to the defendant to demonstrate that the amount of the loss is other than that claimed by the victim. (ibid.; people v. chappelone (2010) 183 cal.app.4th 1159, 1172.) people v. millard, supra, 175 cal.app.4th at p. 26.) be limited to the exact amount of the loss in which the defendant is actually found culpable, nor is there any requirement the order reflect the amount of damages that might 4 people v. carbajal (1995) 10 cal.4th 1114, 1121.) the tpeople v. thygesen (1999) 69 cal.app.4th 988, 992.) appellant argues the prosecutor failed to make a prima facie case for restitution because she presented no evidence of the value of the shoes or estimated replacement cost, their condition at the time they were stolen, or that they were kept as a collectible. trgument restitution hearing makes clear that the trial court was reviewing a document which but there is no copy of this document in the record on appeal. nor is there a copy of the photograph of the shoes that was presented at the hearing. it is presumed correct. all intendments and presumptions are indulged to support it on matters as to which the record is silent, and error must be affirmatively shown. this is not only a general principle of appellate practice but an ingredient of the constitutional denham v. superior court (1970) 2 cal.3d 557, 564.) without a copy of the relevant documents before us, we cannot presume that the trial court abused its discretion in making a restitution award of $250. indeed, the trial court did not grant the victim the full amount of requested restitution, but reduced it by $100, recognizing the shoes had some value but were not returned in a pristine condition. under the circumstances presented here, appellant has not was irrational, arbitrary or capricious. 5 disposition the order awarding victim restitution is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. __________________________, acting p. j. ashmann-gerst we concur: _____________________________, j. chavez ____________________________, j. hoffstadt
