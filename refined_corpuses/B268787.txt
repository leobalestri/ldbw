(people v. wende (1979) 25 cal.3d 436 (wende).) for the reasons that follow, we affirm. ervin was convicted by a jury of second degree robbery on june 9, 2010. (pen. code,  211,1 the robbery case.) during the robbery case, he was charged with attempting to dissuade a witness while released on bail, and was convicted on that charge by a different jury. ( 136.1, subd. (a)(2); 12022.1.) in both cases, the court found allegations of prior felony convictions (a 1991 robbery and 2001 grand theft) and prior prison terms to be true. at a joint sentencing hearing in august 2010, ervin received 15 years in the robbery case, with a consecutive 12-year term in the witness intimidation case. he appealed from the judgment in each case. we affirmed the convictions but reduced the aggregate sentence from 27 years to 21 years. (people v. ervin (sept. 20, 2011, b227021 [nonpub. opn.].) later, wcorpus in case nos. b240092, b247027 and b249784. in 2015, ervin filed the two post judgment motions that are the subject of the present appeal. the first sought to vacate the robbery conviction for lack of jurisdiction, and the second sought to enter a default judgment. the trial court (judge eric p. harmon) denied both motions on october 28, 2015. this timely appeal followed. wende brief requesting that we independently review the record for arguable issues. after being advised of his right to file a supplemental brief, ervin filed a supplemental brief, a motion to vacate a void judgment for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, and a request for admissions. ervin relies on a documenthis copy of a preliminary complaint in the robbery casewhich is not part of the record on appeal. he argues that because his copy of the complaint is not signed, the robbery case must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. we disagree. the trial court correctly on lacks merit and the motion is denied. first, an unsigned complaint would not warrant 1 all further statutory references are to the penal code. 3 tampering with the judgment. people v. mason (1960) 183 cal.app.2d 168 (objections to criminal complaint must be taken while defendant is held under warrant of arrest; after preliminary hearing and order holding defendant to answer to superior court, original it also denied the motion as factually erroneous: second, the court has reviewed the file and both the complaint filed on october 6, 2009 finding, which is presumed to be correct. (people v. raviart (2001) 93 cal.app.4th 258, 262.) even assuming , that does not mean the original documents contained in the superior court file were not signed. the trial o the contrary is presumed to be correct, and ervin has not shown otherwise. ervin seeks to vacate the robbery conviction, claiming he did not take personal property from the victim by means of force or fear, and that the detective who interviewed the victim was lying. but he already challenged the sufficiency of the evidence in the previous appeal (b227021), in which we affirmed the judgment of conviction. it is past time to revisit the issue. (see people v. superior court (gregory) (2005) 129 cal.app.4th 324, 330332 [criminal defendants are precluded by one final judgment rule from bringing multiple appeals in the same action].) supplemental brief and papers, and the entire appellate record, we find there is no arguable issue on appeal.
