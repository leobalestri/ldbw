( 1001.36, subd. (a).) (stats. 2018, ch. 34,  24.) appellant timely appealed the may 30, 2018 order.3 2 indicated her mother was homeless, but appellant denied this and maintained she has never been homeless. 3 4 discussion i. section 1001.36 does not apply retroactively. appellant contends her conviction should be conditionally reversed and the matter remanded for the trial court to determine, retroactively, whether defendant qualifies for a pretrial diversion program for defendants with qualifying mental disorders under 1001.36. relying on in re estrada (1965) 63 cal.2d 740 (estrada) and people v. superior court (lara) (2018) 4 cal.5th 299 (lara), appellant argues section 1001.36 should apply retroactively because it confers an ameliorative benefit to defendants whose judgments are not final on appeal. respondent contends section 1001.36 is not retroactive, focusing on the express language of the statute which provides that pretrial mental health diversion is available respondent argues that, wnarrowly to include the adjudication of guilt at trial, or broadly to include the rendering of judgment, a. section 1001.36 effective june 27, 2018, section 1001.36 authorizes pretrial diversion in lieu of criminal prosecution for defendants with p]retrial diversionpostponement of prosecution, either temporarily or permanently, at any point in the judicial process from the point at which the accused is charged until adjudication, to allow the defendant to shall be deemed to be a final judgment within the meaning of this sectionee also in re delong (2001) 93 cal.app.4th 562, 571 [pronouncement of sentence, the probation order is a final ].) 5 italics added.) a trial court may grant pretrial diversion under section 1001.36 if the court finds: (1) the defendant suffers from an identified mental disorder; (2) the mental disorder was a significant factor in the commission of the charged offense; (3) the defendant consents to diversion and waives his or her speedy trial rights; (5) the defendant agrees to comply with the treatment; and (6) the defendant will not pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety if treated in the community.

(d).) a stated purpose of the new law ncreased diversion of individuals with mental disorders to mitigate the individuals entry and reentry into the criminal justice system while protecting public safety( 1001.35.) 6 b. retroactivity of section 1001.36 penal statutes are generally presumed to apply prospectively unless they expressly state otherwise. ( 3.) however, under estradapunishment is presumed to apply in all cases not yet reduced to final judgment as of the amendatory statute (people v. weaver (2019) 36 cal.app.5th 1103, 1116, review granted october 9, 2019, s257049 (weaver) estrada rule rests on an inference that, in the absence of contrary indications, a legislative body ordinarily intends for ameliorative changes to the criminal law to extend as broadly as possible, distinguishing only as necessary between sentences that are final and sentences lara, supra, 4 cal.5th at p. 308.) lara extended retroactivity principles under estrada to an amendment in the law that did not reduce punishment for a particular crime, but did reduce the possibility of punishment for a class of persons, namely, juveniles. (id. at p. 308.) the courts of appeal are currently divided on the question of whether section 1001.36 applies retroactively to persons who were tried, convicted, and sentenced before section 1001.36 went into effect, but as to whom judgment is not yet final. in people v. frahs (2018) 27 cal.app.5th 784, review granted december 27, 2018, s252220 (frahs), the fourth district followed the reasoning of estrada and lara to hold that section 1001.36 broadly as possible to further the legislative purpose of increasing diversion of individuals with mental disorders. (frahs, at p. 791.) court found he was potentially eligible for section 1001.36 diversion, notwithstanding that his current criminal action had 7 frahs reasoned how this particular diversion program is ordinarily designed to frahs, at p. 791; see also weaver, supra, 36 cal.app.5th at p. 1122, rev. granted; people v. hughes (2019) 39 cal.app.5th 886, 895, review granted november 26, 2019, s258541.) the fifth district disagreed with frahs in people v. craine (2019) 35 cal.app.5th 744 (craine), review granted september 11, 2019, s256671. craine legislative history contraindicate a retroactive intent with regard to defendants, like craine, who have been found guilty of the id. at p. 749.) the court or id. at p. 755; see also people v. torres (2019) 39 cal.app.5th 849, 855 (torres) [citing craine that pronouncement of judgment, which occurs at the time of craine, at p. 755.) according to craine, the intent of the legislature was evident from the text of the statute, which chargesrecord of the arrest(id. functionally impossible once a defendant has been tried, found id. at p. 756.) the intent of the 8 legislature was confirmed by the legislative history, which at an early stage in the proceedingsa focus on reducing the number of referrals to state hospitals based on findings of incompetency to stand trial. (id. at pp. unfinished business analysis of sen. bill no. 215 (reg. sess.) as amesen. amends. to assem. bill 1810 as amended june 12, 2018, item 17, p. 7).) as craine observed, the purpose of a pretrial avoid (craine, at p. 755.) c. analysis in analyzing the retroactive application of section 1001.36, case involving statutory interpretation, our fundamental task here is to determine the legislatures intent so as to effectuate the laws purpose. [citation.] we begin by examining the statutes words, giving them a plain and commonsense (people v. gonzalez (2017) 2 cal.5th 1138, 1141.) by the plain language of section 1001.36, which the accused is charged until adjudicationnot retroactively available to appellant, whose case had already . ( 1001.36, subd. (c), italics added.) we employ the commonsense merits. (see craine, supra, 35 cal.app.5th rev. granted [adjudication, 9 which is an undefined term, is shorthand for the adjudication of guilt or acquittal people v. clancey (2013) 56 cal.4th 562, 570 entencing occurs after adjudication and section 1001.36, subdivision (c) provides that mental health diversion may be ordered at any point in the judicial process until adjudication. (torres, supra, 39 cal.app.5th at p. 856, first italics added.) thus, by the time appellant was sentenced to probation following 4 there is no re-adjudication of guilt by trial or plea following an order granting probation. a subsequent probation revocation does not revocation of probation is that the offender must commence to serve a term for an offense of which he previously was properly people v. mcgavock (1999) 69 cal.app.4th 332, 337, citing in re coughlin (1976) 16 cal.3d 52, 61].) because 4 when probation is imposed and the imposition of sentence suspended, the trial court retains .) thus, we construe an order granting probation and suspending for purposes of this analysis. (cf. in re delong, supra, 93 cal.app.4th at pp. 570571, citing people v. howard (1997) 16 cal.4th 1081, 1092 [observing theffectuating purpose of amendatory law]; see also cal. rules of court, rule 4.405(5) any disposition of the case that does not amount to a dismissal, 10 who may retroactively benefit from mental health diversion under section 1001.36. courts have recognized the inherent conflict in frahsreasoning that available only up until the time that a defendants case is ordinarily designed to operate, not a limit on its retroactivity. (frahs, supra, 27 cal.app.5th at p. 791, rev. granted; see, e.g., weaver, supra, 36 cal.app.5th at p. 1120, rev. granterecognize that application of section 1001.36 to individuals who have already been convicted but whose convictions are not yet final on appeal may appear to conflict with several aspects of the .) potential diversion after the defendant has been convicted. (weaver, at p. 1120.) to reconcile this conflict, weaver viewed intent that individuals who commit their crimes after the effective date of section 1001.36 and whose guilt has been adjudicated in the form of a plea of guilty or no contest or a conviction after trial are no longer eligible for pretrial diversion uibid.) by extension, individuals who whose guilt has been adjudicated would be eligible for the how this particular diversion program is ordinarily designed to operateprospectivelyfrahs, at p. 791; weaver, at p. 1120.) 11 further, the language of the statute describes the implementation of the diversion program prior to trial, and makes no provisions for its implementation at a later time. to be eligible for diversionright to a that prosecution will be postponed until adjudication, not judgment ( 1001.36, subd. (c)), and discusses the implications of of arrest, not conviction ( 1001.36, indication in the language of the statute that the legislature contemplated a retroactive application of section 1001.36 impertinent for this court to place a strained interpretation upon a statute merely to bring about a result which, in the enactment people v. borja (1980) 110 cal.app.3d 378, 382.) under the posttrial diversion is simply not authorized. we find the reasoning in craine persuasive, and we therefore conclude that defendants who were tried, convicted, and sentenced to probation before the adoption of section 1001.36 are not eligible for pretrial mental health diversion. although the statute reduces the possibility of punishment for a class of personsmentally ill defendants whose cases have not been the plain language of the statute and our that appellant is not a member of this intended class. 12 ii. appellant has forfeited any challenge to the restitution fine and court assessments. appellant challenges the imposition of the $400 restitution fine and court assessments on due process grounds. relying on people v. dueas (2019) 30 cal.app.5th 1157 (dueas), appellant urges us to stay execution of the restitution fine and vacate the court assessments because appellant is allegedly indigent and the trial court failed to consider whether she had the ability to pay. we disagree because the issue was forfeited. section 1202.4, subdivision (d) allows a court to consider a than the minimum fine of $300. ( 1202.4, subd. (d); people v. avila (2009) 46 cal.4th 680, 729 (avila).) the statute provides that a defendant who is unable to pay more than the minimum ( 1202.4, subd. (d).) thus, to preserve the issue on appeal, appellant was obligated to object to the amount of the fine and demonstrate her inability to pay anything more than the $300 minimum in the trial court. (see avila, supra, at p. 729.) dueas is distinguishable because the court imposed the minimum restitution fine under section 1202.4, subdivision (b), and the defendant clearly advised the court of her inability to pay. (dueas, supra, 30 cal.app.5th at pp. 1162, 1169.) here, the trial court did not impose the minimum restitution fine, and appellant did not object to the fine and assessments or indicate an inability to pay, as statutorily required, even after the trial court advised appellant of her right to an ability-to-pay hearing. appellant concedes her trial counsel failed to object to the fine and assessments, but argues there was no forfeiture because: 13 (1) she presents a pure question of law based on undisputed facts that can be raised for the first time on appeal; and (2) it would have been futile to object before the trial court. we are not persuaded. by claiming indigence, appellant requests a factual determination of her inability to pay based on facts respondent disputes and which the record does not conclusively establish. further, an objection based on her inability to pay would not ent and under governing law which clearly contemplates such an objection. ( 1202.4, subd. (d); see also avila, supra, 46 cal.4th at p. 729.) having failed to object in the trial court based on her inability to pay, appellant has forfeited this issue as to the restitution fine and court assessments. (see people v. scott (1994) 9 cal.4th 331, 353.) disposition the orders of the trial court are affirmed. not to be published in the official reports edmon, p. j. we concur: lavin, j. dhanidina, j.
