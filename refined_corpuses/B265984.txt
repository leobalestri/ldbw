(see luis m. v. superior court (2014) 59 cal.4th 300, 304 (luis m.); people v. aguilar (2016) 4 cal.app.5th 857, 862.) the standard of proof at the restitution hearing is preponderance of the evidence, not beyond a reasonable doubt, and we review restitution orders under section 1202.4 for abuse of discretion. (people v. lehman (2016) 247 cal.app.4th 795, 801; people v. santori (2015) 243 cal.app.4th 122, 126.) at the the prosecution bears the initial burden of making a prs economic loss. once that showing is made, the burden shifts to the defendant to demonstrate that the amount of the loss is other than that claimed by the victim.people v. aguilar, supra, 4 cal.app.5th at p. 862.) amount of restitution ordered by the trial court, no abuse of discretion will be found by t(people v. holmberg (2011) 195 cal.app.4th 1310, 1320; see people v. millard here, the trial court estimate of the daily electricity usage associated with marijuana growing operation, converted this usage to a monthly amount, and then multiplied this amount by the approximate number of months the account had been in . l within its discretion. (see people v. phu (2009) 179 cal.app.4th 280, 283 6 ; people v. prosser (2007) 157 cal.app.4th 682, 690 reasonably be said to make the victim whole, and may not make indeed, the court in people v. phu, supra, 179 cal.app.4th 280 approved a virtually the equipment in the house and the date of a change in the utility service.

(id. at pp. 303, 304, 308.) mikhi argues the trial court violated the holding of luis m. by relying on an estimate with no 7 s or transitions in the size of the marijuana grow. he contends that under luis mvidence supporting a restitution award needs to be based on the individual conduct of inconsistent with the cost model which may reduce the r luis m. does not bear the weight defendant accords it.(people v. aguilar, supra, 4 cal.app.5th at p. 864.) in luis m. the supreme court held that while the trial court, in calculating the need not ascertain the exact dollar amount of . . . losses . . . , its calculation . . . must have some (luis m., supra, 59 cal.4th at p. 309.) there was such a factual nexus here. the trial court did not base the restitution award on an average of stolen electricity used for marijuana cultivation operations and apply that value to mikhi. (cf. ibid. [juvenile its estimate on an average of all costs of graffiti cleanup rather than a rational estimate of costs occasioned by duct the trial court based its restitution award on information relating solely to and equipment. mikhi also suggests an alternative restitution calculation, based on electricity used by a 2009 marijuana cultivation operation at the same property, that presumably yields a smaller restitution amount. and perhaps it does, although mikhi does not calculate or state what that amount would be. that there may have been an alternative method of calculating restitution, however, does not mean it was an abuse of discretion for the trial award. the method chosen by the trial court was rational, reasonable, and not arbitrary. (see people v. giordano (2007) 42 8 cal.4th 644, 663-664 a trial court has broad discretion to choose a method for calculating the amount of restitutionlong as the a method that is rationally designed to determine the survivins economic losspeople v. pangan (2013) 213 cal.app.4th 574, 579 reasonable method and produce[ nonarbitrary result].) the fact that it may not have been the only rational, reasonable, and nonarbitrary method does not mean it was an abuse of discretion. disposition the order is affirmed. segal, j. we concur: perluss, p. j. zelon, j.
