(pen. code,1  236.) because he had three prior strike convictions, he was sentenced to 25 years to life in state prison. this court affirmed the judgment on appeal. (people v. hill (june 6, 2007, b188141) [nonpub. opn.].) in 2012, defendant filed a section 1170.126 petition to recall his sentence. following a september 2016 suitability hearing, the trial court denied the petition on the ground defendant posed an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. we affirm. discussion a. there is no presumption of suitability for resentencing nor due process liberty interest in resentencing under section 1170.126 defendant claims there is a presumption that inmates eligible for section 1170.126 resentencing will be found suitable defendant further asserts there is a due process liberty interest in resentencing under the federal and state constitutions. we conclude section 1170.126 creates no presumption in favor of a reduced sentence and no due process liberty interest. he petitioner 1 further statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise noted. 3 shall be resentenced . . . unless the court, in its discretion, determines that resentencing the petitioner would pose an nt cites greenholtz v. inmates of nebraska penal and correctional complex (1979) 442 u.s. 1 (greenholtz), and board of pardons v. allen (1987) 482 u.s. 369 (allen), both of which concerned release on parole. it is true that in both greenholtz and allen the united states supreme court held mandatory statutory language similar to that in section 1170.126, subdivision (f) created a presumption in favor of parole release. (greenholtz, supra, 442 u.s. at pp. 11-12; allen, supra, 482 u.s. at pp. 377-378.)2 that 2 the nebraska parole statute at issue in greenholtz provideda committed offender who is eligible for release on parole, it shall order his release unless it is of the opinion that his release should be deferred because: [] (a) there is a substantial risk that he will not conform to the conditions of parole; [] (b) his release would depreciate the seriousness of his crime or promote disrespect for the law; [] (c) his release would have a substantially adverse effect on institutional discipline; or [] (d) his continued correctional treatment, medical care, or vocational or other training in the facility will substantially enhance his capacity to lead a law-(greenholtz, supra, 442 u.s. at p. 11, quoting neb.rev.stat.  83-1,114(1) (1976), italics added.) the statute at issue in allen restrictions, the board shall release on parole . . . any person center . . . when in its opinion there is reasonable probability that the prisoner can be released without detriment to the prisoner or 4 presumption gave rise to a due process liberty interest entitled to some measure of constitutional protection. to that extent, greenholtz and allen our supreme court has also recognized a due process liberty interest in parole decisions under the california constitution. (in re rosenkrantz (2002) 29 cal.4th 616, 660-661, 664.) the language of section 1170.126, subdivision (f) does require that if, for example, the trial court somehow had no evidence at all beariit would be required to resentence the defendant. however, this is a far cry from the language creating a meaningful presumptionpresumption that defendant seeks. the language of the subdivision does not clearly create such a presumption. satisfies the [eligibility] criteria . . . the petitioner shall be resentenced . . . unless the court, in its discretion, determines that resentencing the petitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of this language means that if a court is evaluating both choices in how to sentence a defendant, it has discretion to select either choice, with no presumption in favor of one or the other. as another court has held, this reading people v. buford (2016) 4 cal.app.5th 886, 902; people v. esparza (2015) 242 cal.app.4th 726, 738; cf. people v. gutierrez (2014) 58 cal.4th 1354, 1371 [interpreting  190.5, subd. (b)if a teacher you must take a final exam or, at allen, supra, 482 u.s. at p. 376, quoting mont. code ann.  46-23-201 (1985).) 5 your it would be reasonable for the students to believe they were equally free to pursue either option.].) the statutory language thus that a second-(people v. esparza, supra, 242 cal.app.4th at p. 738.) we are persuaded that the better reading is that section 1170.126, subdivision (f) creates no presumption but leaves the risk-of-if the voters had intended to create a presumption in favor of resentencing , proposition 36 could have said so, instead of granting the trial court discretion to find dangerousness. (people v. buford, supra, 4 cal.app.5th at p. 903; people v. esparza, supra, 242 cal.app.4th at p. 739; cf. people v. woodhead (1987) 43 cal.3d 1002, 1010 the authors of proposition 8 intended to include . . . it is fair to further, the trial court is given broad discretion under section story, it, in its discretion, determines to be relevant to deciding whether a new sentence would result in an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. this expansive grant of authority indicates that expertise in making a case-specific determination of dangerousness, rather than guides the court toward a particular result in general. requirement would place a constraint on courts that is nowhere found in the enacted statute. in supporting this reading as well, we note that parole release and section 1170.126 resentencing occur in circumstances 6 that differ in an important way. to become eligible for parole, an inmate serving an indeterminate potential life sentence such as -year-to-life sentence must first serve the determinate part of the sentence. ( 3046, subd. (a)(2); people v. franklin (2016) 63 cal.4th 261, 273.) in contrast, section 1170.126 may come into play at any time, even relatively early in the service of a determinate sentence. and although an indeterminate life sentence creates an expectation of a parole grant (in re rosenkrantz, supra, 29 cal.4th at pp. 660-661, 664), ation of a sentence reduction. even if we assume section 1170.126 language gives rise to a presumption in favor of resentencing and a due process liberty interest, defendant has not shown any due process deprivation. defendant asserts the trial court deprived him of due process by reaching an arbitrary or capricious decision. as discussed below, we conclude the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying was neither arbitrary nor capricious.3 3 de1170.18, subd. (c)) applies to section 1170.126. after defendant filed his opening brief, however, our supreme court held to the contrary. (people v. valencia (2017) 3 cal.5th 347, 351-352.) 7 b. the trial court did not abuse its discretion under section 1170.126 the trial court issued a lengthy memorandum of decision . the court record, rehabilitation record, the california department of corrections and rehabilitation (cdcr) classification score, california static risk assessment (csra) score, age and post-release plaopinions. ( 1170.126, subd. (g).) the trial rehabilitation and post-release plans are supportive of release. the court finds, however, that these positive factors are outweighed prison disciplinary misconduct, cdcr classification score, csra score, and elevated risk assessments. in sum, the totality of the record, including consideration of all the statutory factors, demonstrates that resentencing petitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of defendant challenges dangerousness finding as an abuse of discretion. finding must rest on a preponderance of the evidence. (evid. code,  115; people v. superior court (kaulick) (2013) 215 cal.app.4th 1279, 1305.) the statute vests broad discretion in the trial court. ( 1170.126, subd. (subds. (f) & (g).) exercising its discretion . . . the court may consider: [] (1) the crimes committed, the extent of injury to victims, the length of prior prison commitments, and the remoteness of the crimes; [] ord and record of 8 rehabilitation while incarcerated; and [] (3) any other evidence the court, within its discretion, determines to be relevant in deciding whether a new sentence would result in an  1170.126, subd. (g).) our review is for an abuse of discretion. , as here, a discretionary power is statutorily vested in the trial court, its except on a showing that the court exercised its discretion in an arbitrary, capricious or patently absurd manner that resulted in [citation.]people v. rodrigues (1994) 8 cal.4th 1060, 1124-1125.) test for abuse of discretion is whether the trial court exceeded the bounds of reason. when two or more inferences can reasonably be deduced from the facts, the reviewing court has no authority to substitute its decision for that of the trial court. [citations.](shamblin v. brattain (1988) 44 cal.3d 474, 478-479.) we find no abuse of discretion. 1. the evidence evaluated by the trial court we consider the evidence with respect to the factors on which the trial court relied in finding current dangerousness. 9 a. criminal history defendant was an admitted gang member with a long criminal history.4 his law enforcement encounters began in 1980, when he was 13 years old; this was 23 years before he committed the present offense. defendant was not free from incarceration or some form of law enforcement supervision for most of the 23 intervening years. he repeatedly violated the conditions of his probation and parole. as the trial court and supervision failed to deter him from continuing to engage in criminal conduct. defendant had four sustained juvenile petitions for grand theft person (1980) burglary (1982) and controlled substance possession (1984). he spent nearly five years in the california youth authority, from february 10, 1984 to october 6, 1988. defendant had three prior felony convictions, for robbery in 1989 and 1993 and for attempted robbery in 1997. he spent a year in state prison, from march 6, 1990 to july 5, 1991, after violating his probation in the 1989 case. in 1993, he was sentenced to three years in state prison for the attempted robbery. in 1997, defendant was convicted of kidnapping with special circumstances and attempted robbery. he was sentenced to three years in state prison. he was paroled on september 9, 2001 and discharged from parole on october 17, 2002. he did not perform well on probation and parole. his probation was revoked 4 from the gang. dr. murphy found debriefing in the records she reviewed. 10 in 1989 and again in 1990. he repeatedly violated his parolein 1991, 1993, 1995, 1999, 2000, 2001 and 2002. controlled substance use led to a misdemeanor under the influence conviction in 1989 and a probation revocation for pcp possession for sale in 1990. defendant was twice convicted of misdemeanor spousal abuse, in 1996 and 2004. defendant incurred his most recent conviction after, on april 2, 2004, he locked himself in a bathroom with an 11-year-old girl. when the child attempted to leave, defendant closed the bathroom door, which hit her in the head and face.5 defendant was 36 years old at the time. defendant repeatedly exhibited violent behavior. in 1981, defendant forcibly removed a necklace from an elementary school also in 1981, defendant demanded a watch from a 12-year-old. defendant struck the victim after he or she handed over the watch. in 1989, defendant grabbed a woman by the throat, punched her in the stomach and yanked two gold chains from her neck. in 1993, defendant attempted to rob a clerk at a jack-in-the-box restaurant. he walked up to the drive-through window and attempted to hit the clerk with a stick. during the current offense, defendant forcibly detained an 11-year-old girl. he closed a door as she attempted to leave. the door hit her in the head and face. 5 the child reported defendant sexually assaulted her. he was charged with, but not convicted of, aggravated sexual assault of a child and committing lewd and lascivious acts upon a child under the age of 14. the jury hung 11 to 1 as to those charges. in reaching its suitability decision, the trial court gave no weight to the conduct underlying the charges for which defendant was not convicted. 11 criminal history indicated that he presented a risk of danger to public safety. during the 23 years before committing this offense, defendant was nearly continuously incarcerated or under supervision, demonstrating an inability to refrain from criminal conduct, even while on probation and parole. b. prison disciplinary record during his current commitment, defendant incurred seven serious rules violations, including four for fighting with other inmates. all four fights occurred in 2012 or laterjanuary 18, 2012, january 26, 2014, february 6, 2014 and june 17, 2015. three of the four fights took place petition to recall his sentence was pending. the fights were his incarceration began in late 2005. the trial court could reasonably conclude the increasing onduct, his willingness to break prison rules, and his fighting with other inmates indicated a lack of sufficient rehabilitation and thus current dangerousness. c. classification score that had increased substantially during the pendency of the instant petition. as our supreme court has explained: system that determines their prison custody level. . . . a higher score means the inmate is considered a higher security risk . . . ; 12 a lower score means the inmate is considered a lower security risk . . . in re jenkins (2010) 50 cal.4th 1167, 1171; see cal. code regs. tit. 15,  3375 et seq.) the lowest score an inmate subject to a life sentence can receive is 19. (california department of corrections and rehabilitation (cdcr), department operations manual (january 1, 2017), ch. 6: adult classification,  61010.11.5, p. 516.)6 inmates can reduce their classification scores by avoiding conduct leading to disciplinary action and performing satisfactorily or better in work, school or vocational training. scores are increased for serious rules violations. (cdcr, department operations manual, supra, ch. 6: adult classification,  61020.19.3, 61020.19.4 pp. 526-528.) on score, upon entering state prison, was 71. it declined over the years. as of january 2014, at a low of 39. when the trial court held the suitability hearing, in september 2016, defeclassification score had risen to 53, indicating he was considered a higher security risk. moderately elevated compared to other inmates seeking resentencing through the reform act who have successfully reduced their scores to 19 over the course of th d. california static risk assessment score state regulations explain: assessment score (csra) . . . is a validated risk assessment tool that utilizes a set of risk factors which are most predictive of 6 <http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/regulations/adult_operations /docs/dom _toc.html> [as of oct. 5, 2017]. 13 recidivism. the tool produces a risk number value that will predict the likelihood that an offender will incur a felony arrest within a three-year period after release to parole. risk factors include, but are not limited to, age, gender, criminal misdemeanor and felony convictions, and sentence/supervision violations. [] (b) csra risk number values fall in one of the following five categories: [] (1) low [] (2) moderate risk, with a risk number value o[] (3) high risk drug, with a risk a greater risk of reoffending with a drug offense. [] (4) high property means that the offender has a greater risk of reoffending with a property offense. [] (5) high risk violence, the offender has a greater risk of reoffending with a violent offense. [] (c) for the purposes of this section, the csra is defined as an actuarial tool that computes the likelihood to re-offend (incur a felony arrest within a three-year period after release to parole), and uses static indicators that do not change. these indicators include gender, age and offense history of the  3768.1.) petitioned for resentencing have a csra of 1.l court the trial court could reasonably conclude dcsra moderate risk assessment contributed to a conclusion of current dangerousness. 14 e. age ies show that criminality declines drastically after age 40. citing a stanford university the recidivism rate of lifers is dramatically lower than that of all other state prisoners, indeed iin re stoneroad (2013) 215 cal.app.4th 7 the trial court reasonably concluded that although defendant was 49 years old, due to his recent disciplinary history, he had not demonstrated he was aging out of a significant risk of serious criminal conduct. f. expert opinions two psychologists, dr. hy malinek (appointed by the court dr. murphy (retained by the people) interviewed defendant. dr. malinek met with defendant 7 non-lifer studies demonstrate that as a general matter, people age out of crime. for most offensesand in most societiescrime rates rise in the early teenage years, peak during the mid-to-late teens, and subsequently decline dramatically. not only are most violent crimes committed by people under 30, but even the criminality that continues after that declines drastically after criminal justice center, life in limbo: an examination of parole release for prisoners serving life sentences with the possibility of parole in california (sept. 2011) 1, 17.) the stanford study has been cited in in re stoneroad, supra, 215 cal.app.4th at pages 633-634 and footnote 21 and in in re morganti (2012) 204 cal.app.4th 904, 930.) 15 on october 15, 2014. dr. murphy interviewed defendant on february 4, 2016. dr. malinek also performed diagnostic tests.8 both experts agreed defendant suffered from antisocial personality disorder, but the condition had waned over time and continued to diminish. both also aabuse had been a significant factor in his criminal conduct in the past. it appeared he had been substance-free since entering state prison. dr. malinek found defendant posed a moderate risk of reoffending. dr. malinek concluded: moderate. the risk will decrease should mr. hill be closely monitored and receive assistance in reintegrating into the community after nearly a decade of incarceration. risk management is closely associated with risk assessment, and in that sense, one cannot underestimate the importance of tight monitoring, continued substance abuse treatment, and rehab before she interviewed defendant, dr. murphy viewed him as 8 dr. malinek administered the following psychological tests and forensic measures: 1. clinical interview and mental status examination. [] 2. millon clinical multiaxial inventory iii (mcmi-iii), a comprehensive personality test. [] 3. psychopathy checklist-revised (pcl-r), a measure of psychopathy.

[] situation is in fac[] . . . [] in closing, this examiner particularly concurs with dr. have assistance in the form of monitoring upon release from custody, and that mr. hill will need to actively manage his risk, namely his substance use, if he is to successfully transition to the as noted above, the trial court found that a moderate risk was an unreasonable risk. the trial court could reasonably conclude this factor weighed against defendant in evaluating his current dangerousness. 2. analysis of the totality of the evidence the trial court, in its discretion, reasonably concluded ence, his failure to remain free of custody or supervision for 23 years 17 prior to his present incarceration, his inability to perform satisfactorily on probation and parole, his repeated recent fights with other inmates, his recently increased classification score, and his assessment as a moderate recidivism risk meant he currently posed an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. there was no abuse of discretion. defendant argues there is no rational nexus between the resting on static, immutable factorsand its ultimate conclusion that defendant currently poses an unreasonable risk of danger to the public. (in re lawrence (2008) 44 cal.4th 1181, 1227 [there must be a rational nexus between the circumstances of the commitment offense and current dangerousness]; people v. esparza, supra, 242 cal.app.4th at p. only if those facts support the ultimate conclusion that an inmate continues ].) defendant asserts that according to drs. malinek and murphy, consistent with his csra score of 2, he poses only a moderate risk of recidivism, which is not an unreasonable risk according to the trial court found, however, was that, in light of other factors criminal historydemonstrating an inability to refrain from criminal conduct or to perform satisfactorily under supervisionand his recent fighting in prison, a moderate risk was not a reasonable risk. the trial court acted within its discretion in making this finding. the court noted that most inmates seeking resentencing under section 1170.126 had a csra score indicating a low risk of reoffending. that the csra score rests on static indicatorsage, gender, 18 criminal historydoes not foreclose the trial court from relying on it. defendant suggests the trial court gave insufficient weight to the connection between his past substance abuse and his criminality, and his commitment to remain sober and rehabilitate himself while in custody. the trial court acknowledged supported resentencing. the alcoholics anonymous, narcotics anonymous, and other substance abuse related programs, his absence of drug-related rules violations, and his clean drug tests. the trial court concluded, hoefforts were outweighed by his disciplinary misconduct, his classification score, and his elevated risk assessments. both expertsdrs. malinek and murphysubstance abuse history and rehabilitation in reaching their conclusions that defendant nevertheless posed a moderate risk of reoffending. the trial court was not compelled to give any clusion that he was not aging out of a significant risk of serious criminal conduct. of danger to public safety; while his age does not weigh against despite being in his late forties, defendant recently had engaged in multiple fights with other inmates. his misconduct had escalated, and the fights were his most serious misconduct during his lengthy current incarceration. defethe 19 trial court could reasonably rely on that record in concluding outweigh other factors in demonstrating his recidivism risk. defendant asserts that because his risk assessment rested on static factors it was not an accurate predictor of current dangerousness. moderate risk assessment was derived from both static and assessment measures that are used that score as moderate, but a plan for treatment, a release plan, lack of [narcissism] and ownership of what htho dr. malinek similarly testified his assessment of assessment, a forensic interview, personality testing, prison records, educational progress, a conversation with defendant about substance abuse, and his relapse prevention plan. dr. malinek administered tests that factored in dynamic considerations, including personality traits, age, look at potential for violence,symptoms of major mental illns that the person may be facing,and -education, employment, anti-social attitudes, [and] antisocial both drs. malinek and murphy considered dr. concluding that defendant had a moderate recidivism risk. their risk assessments therefore did not rest on static factors alone. 20 disposition resentencing under penal code section 1170.126 is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports raphael, j. we concur: kriegler, acting p.j. baker, j. judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
