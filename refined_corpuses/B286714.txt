 filed 2/14/19 p. v. alfaro ca2/5 not to be published in the official reports california rules of court, rule 8.1115(a), prohibits courts and parties from citing or relying on opinions not certified for publication or ordered published, except as specified by rule 8.1115(b). this opinion has not been certified for publication or ordered published for purposes of rule 8.1115. in the court of appeal of the state of california second appellate district division five the people, plaintiff and respondent, v. george alfaro, defendant and appellant. b286714 (los angeles county super. ct. no. ba448030) appeal from a judgment of the superior court of los angeles county, edmund willcox clarke, jr., judge. affirmed. mark r. feeser, under appointment by the court of appeal, for defendant and appellant. xavier becerra, attorney general, gerald a. engler, chief assistant attorney general, lance e. winters, senior assistant attorney general, shawn mcgahey webb, supervising deputy attorney general, gary a. lieberman, deputy attorney general, for plaintiff and respondent. 2 defendant george alfaro (defendant) appeals from a criminal judgment entered after a jury found him guilty of first degree residential burglary (pen. code,1  459) and second degree robbery ( 211). the charges were predicated on evidence that, in october 2015, defendant broke into the home of victim carol cortes (cortes) and stole a television and cash, and later, in december 2015, robbed the same victim of her cell phone after punching her in the face. at sentencing, the trial court granted a defense motion pursuant to people v. romero (1996) 13 cal.4th 497 (romero) and sentenced defendant to a total of 24 years in prison. the parties are familiar with the facts, and our opinion does not meet the criteria for publication. (cal. rules of court, rule 8.1105(c).) we accordingly resolve the cause before us, consistent with constitutional requirements, via a written opinion with reasons stated. (cal. const., art. vi,  14; lewis v. superior court (1999) 19 cal.4th 1232, 1261-1264 [three-paragraph discussion of issue on appeal satisfies constitutional requirement because opinion is not a brief in reply to order to state the reasons, grounds, or principles upon which a decision is based, [an appellate court] need not discuss every case or fact raised by counsel in support of the * * * 1. defendant contends the prosecution engaged in misconduct during its rebuttal argument by urging the jury to 1 undesignated statutory references that follow are to the penal code. 3 the jurors -finders and to act state standards regarding prosecutorial misconduct are well . . . intemperate behavior violates the federal constitution when it comprises a pattern of conduct ious that it infects the trial with such unfairness as to conduct by a prosecutor that does not render a criminal trial fundamentally unfair is prosecutorial misconduct under state law only if people v. hill (1998) 17 cal.4th 800, 819.) held improper in united states v. solivan (6th cir. 1991) 937 f.2d 1146 and united states v. sanchez (9th cir. 2011) 659 f.3d 1252. in these cases, the prosecutors urged the respective juries to consider how their verdicts would be viewed by others engaged in the same criminal conduct as the defendants. here, by contrast (and as defendant concedes)-school bullying is never suggested convicting defendant of robbery would send a message to other potential robbers, let alone teenage bullies. the defendant (emphasis ours.) that is not improper. the issue is not as straightforward, however, with respect exhortation that jurors view themselves as a remark defendant understands as suggesting the jury abandon its role as a neutral 4 fact-finder. but there was no objection to this remark (nor a request that the jury be admonished), and the point is therefore forfeited.2 (people v. winbush (2017) 2 cal.5th 402, 482;

(former  judge to strike any prior conviction of a serious felony for recent legislative change, however, deletes the provision of section 1385 that makes imposition of a section 667 prior serious felony conviction enhancement mandatory (and related language in section 667 itself), thereby permitting trial courts to strike such enhancements when found to be in the interest of justice. (sen. bill no. 1393 (2017-2018 reg. sess.)  1, 2.) all concerned agree that the change in law worked by senate bill 1393 applies retroactively to defendant under the principles espoused in people v. francis (1969) 71 cal.2d 66 and in re estrada (1965) 63 cal.2d 740. but we agree with the attorney general that a remand to allow the trial court to consider exercising its newly-conferred discretion would be pointless. the trial court expressly stated it agreed to grant romero motion, which avoided an indeterminate three strikes sentence, only because the court was satisfied the maximum determinate sentence it could imposewhich included both of the section 667, subdivision (a)(1) enhancementswas sufficient punishment for the crimes of conviction. with this rationale preserved on the record, there is no reason to remand the matter.
