(a)(1), amended by stats. 1993, ch. 369,  1); corporal injury ( 273.5, former subd. (a), amended by stats. 1988, ch. 576,  1); false imprisonment ( 236); and heroin possession (health & saf. code, former  11350, subd. (a), amended by stats. 1991, ch. 257,  1). as to the aggravated assault count, the jury expressly found that the deadly weapon was an iron. defendant was sentenced to consecutive 25-year-to-life terms for aggravated assault and heroin possession under former sections 667, subdivision (e)(2) and 1170.12, subdivision (c)(2). (stats. 1994, ch. 12,  1, p. 74; stats. 1994, initiative measures, p. a-316.) the sentences on the remaining two counts were stayed under section 654, subdivision (a). defendant appeals from the denial of his resentencing petition under section 1170.126. the trial court found defendant was ineligible for resentencing because, during the commission of the current aggravated assault offense, he was armed with a deadly weapon. ( 667, subd. (e)(2)(c)(iii), 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(c)(iii), 1170.126, subd.

(tiernan v. trustees of cal. state university & colleges (1982) 33 cal.3d 211, 216, fn. 4; johnston v. board of supervisors (1947) 31 cal.2d 66, 70 disapproved on another point in bailey v. los angeles (1956) 46 cas failure to do so is well thought out. the jury expressly found he used an iron in committing the deadly weapon assault thereby rendering him ineligible for resentencing on that count. ( 667, subd. (e)(2)(c)(iii), 1170.12, subd. (c) (2)(c)(iii); people v. white (2014) 223 cal.app.4th 512, 527.) 1 further statutory references are to the penal code except where otherwise noted. 3 but, as to the heroin possession count, in people v. johnson (2015) __ cal.4th __, __, [2015 wl 4031246 ,*1] a serious or violent felony does not disqualify an inmate from resentencing with respect assault conviction does not prevent resentencing on the remaining heroin possession eadly weapon assault conviction barred any resentencing on the heroin possession count. thus, based express ruling and the sole grounds raised on appeal, the order doubt, there are other issues that remain for resolution once the remittitur issues. even if the defendant is eligible for resentencing on the heroin possession conviction, it may be he is unsuitable. (see people v. johnson, supra, __ cal.4th at p. __;  1170.126, subd. (f).) we leave these other matters once the remittitur issues. that part of the on the aggravated assault count is affirmed. the order denying the sentence recall petition of defendant, samuel joseph dominici, is reversed as to his heroin possession conviction. upon remittitur issuance, the trial court is to proceed to determine his suitability for resentencing on the heroin possession conviction. the order denying his sentence recall petition on the aggravated assault conviction is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports turner, p. j. we concur: mosk, j. kriegler, j.
