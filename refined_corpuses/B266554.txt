(pen. code,  3051, subd. (b)(3);1 people v. franklin (2016) 63 cal.4th 261, 284 (franklin).) we matter because defendant is entitled to have the trial court asserecord for his future youth offender parole hearing and, if not, grant him that opportunity. facts and procedural background i. facts in june 2012, defendant was walking down a sidewalk in los angeles, california when he saw two men he recognized on the other side of the street. -hat is, he stared them down). they started to cross the street. they never made it bof seconds . . . to get unarmed and turned to flee. defendant kept shooting until he 1 all further statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise indicated. 3 ran out of bullets. defendant stood over one of the men as the man lay dying in the street, cursed him for belonging to a rival street gang, and proclaimed fac both men died. defendant was just a month past his 18th birthday at the time of the shootings. ii. procedural background the people charged defendant with one count of murder ( 187, subd. (a)) for each victim.2 as to each murder, the people also alleged that defendant intentionally discharged a firearm causing death ( 12022.53, subd. (d)) and that the murder benefited a criminal street gang ( 186.22, subd. (b)(1)(c)). the matter proceeded to trial. the trial court instructed the jury on the crimes of first and second degree murder and on the lesser included offense of voluntary manslaughter due to heat of passion and due to imperfect self-defense. the jury convicted defendant of two counts of second degree murder and found true the firearm enhancement; it did not find true the gang enhancement. the trial court sentenced defendant to prison for 80 years to life. for each second degree murder conviction, the court imposed a sentence of 40 years to life comprised of a base term of 15 years to life plus the 25-year minimum for the firearm enhancement. the court then ran the two 40-year sentences [ed] separate murder 2 the people also charged defendant with one count of attempted murder for an unrelated shooting, but the jury acquitted him of that charge. 4 defendant filed a timely notice of appeal. discussion i. evidentiary ruling a. background facts to negate the element of malice required for first and second degree murder, and to support his proffered defense of imperfect self-defense, defendant sought to introduce (1) testimony from his sister and himself, who would both testify life of violence and paranoia; and (2) testimony from two experts who, drawing upon the foundational facts to be introduced by defendant and his sister, would opine that defendant suffered from a variety of personality, drug, and mental disorders and that defendant had a low iq and poor impulse control. and thus could not testify toall of the incidents defendant himself experienced. not testify until after the experts. midway through trial, however, the court expressed concern that its ruling might pressure defendant into testifying in order to lay the necessary 3 defendant allayed this concern, however, when he informed the court that he was to testify regardless of w based on testimony regarding the abuse she saw defendant suffer would be regarding that very same abuse and excluded it under evidence code section 352. the 3 defendant makes no claim on appeal that his decision to testify was coerced. 5 court indicateif the prosecution attack[ed] the . . . with respect to fabricating the incident[s] that he purportedly suffered defendant testified, the prosecutor did not attack his credibility with respect to the prior incidents, and the two experts testified; defend b. analysis trial court has broad substantially outweighed by the probability that its admission will (a) necessitate undue consumption of time or (b) create substantial danger of undue prejudice, of confusing the issues, or people v. peoples (2016) 62 cal.4th 718, 757, quoting evid. code,  352.) exclusion of evidence on the ground that it i(people v. brown (2003) 31 cal.4th 518, 576 (brown).) we review ibid.) the trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the that it was cumulative. at the time the court ruled, defendant indicated an unequivocal intent to testify, sister would cover the same topicnamely, the incidents she saw defendant suffer as a child. repetitive testimony is cumulative testimony. (see people v. linton (2013) 56 cal.4th 1146, 1191; people v. filson (1994) 22 cal.app.4th 1841, 1850 (filson) [noting , disapproved on other grounds in people v. martinez (1995) 11 cal.4th 434, 452.) credibility with respect to his testimony regarding the prior 6 was not needed to buttress his own testimony. defendant effectively raises three arguments in response. first, he asserts that the trial court erred in concluding that his specifically, defendant cites filson, supra, 22 cal.app.4th 1841 for the proposition that proffered evidence cannot be cumulative unless the evidence to which it is cumulative has already been introduced into evidence. defendant is incorrect. filson held that a tape recording that might have shown a defendant to have been intoxicated to an officer who testified without contradiction that the defendant was not had yet to be impeached. (id. at pp. 1849-1851.) filson does not stand for the broad proposition defendant asserts. indeed, rulings under evidence code section 352 on the basis of proffers. this is not the law. (e.g., people v. brooks (2017) 2 cal.5th 674, cumulative because it provides a different perspective than his for the same incidents. this argument would effectively preclude any court from finding evidence cumulative; again, this is not the law. defendant cites people v. carter (1957) 48 cal.2d 737, 749 for support, but that case dealt with rebutting a charge of recent fabrication, not evidence code section 352. second, defendant argues that the trial court was incorrect when it asserted, during the discussion about whether to admit hearsay. any error in this assertion is of no consequence because the on 352. 7 (people v. chism (2014) 58 cal.4th 1266, 1295ruling was correct on any violates his constitutional rights to due process and to present a defense. however, a ruling that complies with evidence code (brown, supra, 31 cal.4th at pp. 545-546; cf. people v. reeder (1978) 82 cal.app.3d 543, 553 significant be excluded under evidence code section 352, its exclusion can ii. sentencing a. imposition of consecutive sentences to decide whether to run the sentences imposed for separate counts concurrently or consecutively. (people v. clancey (2013) 56 cal.4th 562, 579;  669, subd. (a); cal. rules of court, rule 4.425.) california rules of court, rule 4.425 sets out factors to guide the crimes, including whether . . . [t]he crimes involved separate acts of violence.ules of court, rule 4.425(a)(2).) a trial court must expressly state its reasons for imposing consecutive terms. (people v. tillotson (2007) 157 cal.app.4th 517, 545.) our review is for an abuse of discretion. (clancey, at pp. 579-580.) the trial court did not abuse its discretion in running the two murder sentences consecutively. the trial court expressly [ed] separate murder victimsand s of court, rule 4.425. this factor is sufficient to support the 8 imposition of consecutive sentences. (people v. calhoun (2007) 40 victims as a basis for imposing . . . people v. calderon the rule that acts of violence against different victims may be charged and punished separately even though they occur on the imposition of consecutive sentences. first, he asserts that the trial court was obligated to consider the factors that the united states supreme court has identified as bearing on whether a sentence imposed upon juveniles constitutes unconstitutionally cruel and unusual punishmentunderdeveloped sense of responsibility, (2) vulnerability to negative influences and limited control over their own environment, and (3) lack of well-formed character. (miller v. alabama (2012) 567 u.s. 460, 471-472 (miller).) this argument lacks merit. the supreme court has held that its pronouncements regarding what constitutes cruel and unusual punishment for juveniles apply only to persons under the age of 18. (roper v. simmons (2005) 543 u.s. 551, 574; people v. gutierrez (2014) 58 cal.4th 1354, 1380; people v. abundio (2013) 221 cal.app.4th 1211, 1220-1221; people v. argeta (2012) 210 cal.app.4th 1478, 1482.) defendant was 18 at the time of his crimes. second, defendant alternatively argues that the trial court adult. age as a factor bearing on whether to impose a consecutive or 9 concurrent sentence (cal. rules of court, rule 4.408(a) [rules listing relevant factors do not preclude consideration of unenumerated factors]), the court did not prejudicially err in refusing to do so in this case. the court did not err because defendant did not ask the court to consider his status as a young adult (as opposed to a juvenile), and defendant consequently (people v. boyce (2014) 59 cal.4th 672, 730-731 (boyce).) any error was not prejudicial because a single aggravating factor is sufficient to warrant imposition of consecutive sentences (people v. osband (1996) 13 cal.4th 622, 728-729), and there was one such factor herenamely, the presence of multiple victims. b. cruel and/or unusual punishment unusual punishmentsnarrow proportionality principledisproportionateseverity of the crime. (ewing v. california (2003) 538 u.s. 11, 20 (ewing); harmelin v. michigan (1991) 501 u.s. 957, 996-997 (conc. opn. of kennedy, j.).) the california constitution [c]ruel or unusual const., art. i,  17, italics added), and a court reviewing a sentence must use three criteria to determine it is inflicted that it shocks the conscience and offends boyce, supra, 59 cal.4th at p. 721, quoting in re lynch (1972) 8 cal.3d 410, 424.) these criteria are: (1) the nature of the offense and offender, with emphasis on his danger to society; (2) the penalty imposed compared with the penalties for more serious crimes in california; and (3) the punishment for the same offense in other 10 jurisdictions. (people v. christensen (2014) 229 cal.app.4th 781, 805-806.) when it comes to juvenile offenders, courts must also take into consideration tfactors outlined above. (miller, supra, 567 u.s. at pp. 471-472; graham v. florida (2010) 560 u.s. 48, 74-75; people v. caballero (2012) 55 cal.4th 262, 266.) whether a sentence is cruel and/or unusual is a question of law subject to independent review, viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the judgment. (people v. em (2009) 171 cal.app.4th 964, 971.) 1. defendant argues that his 80-year sentence transgresses the constitutional limits on juvenile sentences because the trial court did not factors, even though defendant was just past his 18th birthday at the time of the crimes. the court did not err. as noted above, the supreme court has confined its special rules governing juvenile sentencing to persons under the age of 18 at the time of their crimes. and even if the those rules applied to defendant, the california supreme court has held that the availability of a youth offender pursuant to section 3051 moots any constitutional challenge to the length of the sentence. (franklin, supra, 63 cal.4th at pp. 280-282.) 2. constitutionality, generally disproportionateme as to be conscience-shocking. (ewing, supra, 538 u.s. at pp. 20, 22; boyce, supra, 59 cal.4th at p. into people v. dillon (1983) 11 34 cal.3d 441, 479; in re nunez (2009) 173 cal.app.4th 709, 726 . . . grossly disproportionate to his crimes for two reasons. first, he has forfeited the claim by not raising this constitutional objection to the trial court. (people v. speight (2014) 227 cal.app.4th 1229, sentence constitutes cruel and unusual punishment forfeits the claim on appellate reviewrit. the offenses themselves were quite egregious. defendant repeatedly shot not just one, but two men in the back as they were running away from himescalating criminality: although defendant was just over the age of 18 at the time of the shootings, he was nevertheless a self-admitted gang member, he had already committed a gun-related offense, and he was then on probation. -year sentence for each murder is consistent with other sentences for the same crime with a gun enhancement based on personal discharge. (e.g., people v. costella (2017) 11 cal.app.5th 1, 3-4.) vis--vis not enough by itself to invalidate the sentence. (people v. haller (2009) 174 punishment scheme is among the most extreme does not compel the conclusion that it is unconstitutionally cruel or unusual defendant raises several arguments in response. first, he asserts that he will not be released until he is 98 years old. he is wrong because he ignores that section 3051 affords him a youth offender parole hearing during his 25th year of incarceration. ( 3051, subd. (b)(3).) 12 second, defendant argues that t the first degree murder charges amounts to a finding that he fired the shots as a sudden reaction to a perceived threat, which reduces his culpability and renders the resulting sentence disproportionate to that culpability. this argument ignores that premeditation and deliberation beyond a reasonable doubt; the necessarily rests upon its findings that he acted with malice and that he did not act in the heat of passion or in imperfect self-not reflect a finding that defendant was reacting suddenly to a perceived threat. third, defendant argues that his violent upbringing and the mental and personality disorders it spawned render his sentence cruel and unusual. this is certainly part of the evidence to be considered in evaluating the nature of the offender. however, when viewed in conjunction with the aggravating nature of the offenses themselves, the 80-year sentence in this case is not cruel and/or unusual. iii. remand to assess need for evidentiary hearing for eventual youth offender parole hearing controlling offense that was committed before the person had attained 23 years of age and for which the sentence is a life term his . . . 51, subds. (a)(1) & (b)(3).) at a youth offender parole hearing, the board of parole ulpability of juveniles as compared to adults, the hallmark features of youth, 13 and any subsequent growth and increased maturity of the prisoner ( 4801, subd. (c); see also  3051, subd. (d).) such evidence is to be derived by personnel, faith leaders, and representatives from community-based organizations with knowledge about the individual before the crime [as well as] maturity since the time of the ( 3051, subd. (f)(1) & (2).) to ensure that this evidence is supreme court has held that a defendant is entitled to a juvefranklin, supra, 63 cal.4th at p. 284; people v. perez (2016) 3 cal.app.5th 612, 615, 618-619 [applying these procedures to a defendant who was 20 years old at the time of the crimes].) under this authority, defendant is entitled to a remand at which the trial court can assess whether defendant has been of franklin, supra, 63 cal.4th at p. 284.) although, , section 3051 only reached persons who were under 18 at the time of their offenses, our legislature subsequently amended section 3051 to reach persons who were under 23 ( 3051, subd. (a)(1), as amended by stats. 2015, ch. 471,  1), and that amendment applies retroactively (franklin, at pp. 278-279). the people resist a remand, arguing that defendant testified about his troubled upbringing and presented expert testimony regarding his personality disorders, 14 low iq, and poor impulse control. of course, the focus of that testimony was on the elements of the charged crimes, the lesser included crimes, eventual suitability for parole. we leave it to the trial court in the first instance to determine whether defendant had a sufficient opportunity to present the evidence relevant to his eventual youth offender parole hearing. disposition the judgment is affirmed. the matter is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with franklin, supra, 63 cal.4th 261. not to be published in the official reports. ______________________, j. hoffstadt we concur: _________________________, acting p. j. ashmann-gerst _________________________, j.* goodman * retired judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
