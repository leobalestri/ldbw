(a)) and one count of grand theft of an automobile (pen. code,  487, subd. (d)(1)). plea of no contest to carjacking.1 in accordance with the plea agreement, the trial court sentenced clark to the middle term of five years, suspended execution of sentence, and placed clark on five years of formal probation on condition she serve 365 days in county jail. the court imposed statutory fines, fees, and assessments, and awarded clark 168 days of presentence custody credit (84 actual days and 84 days of conduct credit). at the time clark entered her plea, the court advised clark of her constitutional rights and the nature and consequences of the plea, which clark stated she understood. counsel for clark factual basis for the plea. the trial court found a factual basis for the plea and that clark timely filed a notice of appeal purportedly limited to issues entry of the plea, which do not challenge the validity of her plea,she was misadvised as did not obtain a certificate of probable cause. discussion we appointed counsel to represent clark on appeal. after an examination of the record, counsel filed an opening brief raising no issues. on august 6, 2015 we attempted to advise clark by mail to the los angeles county jail that she had 30 days to submit any 1 trial counsel for clark recommended that clark acoffer of a plea to grand theft of an automobile in exchange for a three-year upper term sentence and dismissal of the carjacking count. clark rejected this offer. 3 contentions or issues she wanted us to consider. on august 17, 2015 the letter was on september 15, 2015 we sent a notice to clark at the century regional detention facility, again advising her she had 30 days to submit any contentions or issues she wanted us to consider. on september 28, 2015 the sender. not deliverable as addressed. unable to forward.2 handwritten on the envelope were the letters l,which suggest that clark had been released. a criminal defendant who appeals following a plea of no contest or guilty without a certificate of probable cause can only challenge the denial of a motion to suppress evidence or raise grounds validity. (cal. rules of court, rule 8.304(b)(4); see people v. johnson (2009) 47 cal.4th 668, 678.) by asserting she was misadvised of the consequences of her plea, clark is seeking to challenge the validity of the plea, which she cannot do without a certificate of probable cause. (cal. rules of court, rule 8.304(b)(3); see people v. buttram (2003) 30 cal.4th 773, a certificate is required when a defendant claims that warnings regarding the effect of a guilty plea on the right to appeal were inadequate.) with respect to other potential sentencing or post-plea issues that do not in substance challenge the validity of the plea itself, we have examined the record and are satisfied that appellate counsel for clark has fully complied with her responsibilities and there are no arguable issues. (smith v. robbins (2000) 528 u.s. 259, 277-284 [120 s.ct. 746, 145 l.ed.2d 756]; people v. kelly (2006) 40 cal.4th 106, 118-119; people v. wende (1979) 25 cal.3d 436, 441-442.) 2 when we appointed appellate counsel for clark, we directed clark to keep the court informed of his/her mailing address at all times. if you move, you must notify the clerk of this court immediately; otherwise you may not receive important notices clark has not provided any information regarding her current address after her apparent release from the century regional detention facility. 4 disposition the judgment is affirmed. segal, j. we concur: perluss, p. j. zelon, j.
