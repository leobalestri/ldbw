(a)).2 the trial court sentenced him to a third strike sentence of 25 years to life in state prison. ( 667, subds. (b)-(i), 1170.12, subds. (a)-(d).) on appeal, this court affirmed the judgment. (people v. curry (feb. 2, 2000, b131014) [nonpub. opn.].) in 2012, the electorate passed proposition 36, the three strikes reform act of 2012, which, among other modifications of the three strikes law, added section 1170.126 to the penal code to permit petitions for recall of sentences and resentencing by individuals who would not have been subject to indeterminate life sentences had they been sentenced under proposition 36. on december 12, 2012, curry petitioned the trial court to recall his sentence and resentence him. the trial court denied the petition on the ground that curry had been armed with a firearm and was therefore ineligible for resentencing under proposition 36. curry appeals. 1 all further statutory references are to the penal code. 2 the statute has since been renumbered as section 29800, subdivision (a). 3 discussion on appeal, curry argues that former section 12021(a)(1) is not a crime enumerated in proposition 36 as being excluded from eligibility for resentencing, and that, under the circumstances of his conviction, he should not have been deemed ineligible for resentencing. as relevant here, an inmate is not eligible for resentencing under section 1170.126 sed a firearm, was armed with a firearm or deadly weapon, or intended to cause great bodily injury to subd. (e)(2).) acknowledging this provision, curry argues that these factors may not be part of the offense in question, but must be found in addition to another felony. he ion for the possession of a firearm does not fall within the exclusion, and that he is eligible for relief under section 1170.126. the appellate courts have uniformly rejected this argument, a fact curry acknowledges. although he argues those cases were wrongly decided, we disagree. in people v. osuna (2014) 225 cal.app.4th 1020 (osuna), the court noted that the mean having a firearm available for use, either offensivid. at p. 1029.) the court discussed the distinction between being armed and being in without it being available for use. for example, suppose a paroonly he lives) is searched and a firearm is found next to his bed. the parolee is in possession of the firearm, because it is under his dominion and control. if he is not home at the time, however, he is not armed with the firearm, because it is not readily available to him for offensive or defensive use. accordingly, possessing a firearm does not id. at p. 1030.) 4 the evidence in the osuna osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1030.) the defendant did not dispute this. he claimed, however, as does curry, that in order to be ineligible for recall of sentence uibid.) with imposition of an arming enhancementan additional term of imprisonment added to the base term, for which a defendant cannot be punished until and unless convicted of osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1030.) an arming enhancement under section 12022, subdivision (a)(1), may be imposed where osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. both place during the underlying crime and ibid use to further the commission of the underlying felony.ibid.) the crime of possession of a firearm by a felon. thus, a defendant convicted of violating [former] section 12021 does not, regardless of the facts of the offense, risk imposition of between the arming and the possession. however, unlike section 12022, which requires in imposed (italics added), [proposition 36] disqualifies an inmate from eligibility for lesser during the commp. 703.) in other words, it requires a temporal nexus between the arming and the 5 osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1032.) firearm during his pospossession [of a firearm by a felon]. there was no facilitative nexus; his having the firearm available for use did not further his illegal possession of it. there was, however, a temporal n(e)(2)(c)(iii), 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(c)(iii)), and since at issue is not the imposition of additional punishment but rather eligibility for reduced punishment, . . . the literal language of [proposition 36] disqualifies an inmate from resentencing if he or she was osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1032; accord, people v. brimmer (2014) 230 cal.app.4th 782, 799 (brimmer) and people v. white (2016) 243 cal.app.4th 1354, 1362-1363.) appellate courts in the firearm possession cases have uniformly concluded the ineligibility factor applies whenever the record shows the defendant was in actual physical possession of the firearm, and thus armed. (see brimmer, supra, 230 cal.app.4th at p. 797; osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1030; people v. white (2014) 223 cal.app.4th 512, 525; people v. burnes (2015) 242 cal.app.4th 1452, 1458.) they reason that a firearm possession offense that amounts to arming is not a minor non-violent offense for purposes of proposition 36. (see, e.g., people v. blakely (2014) 225 felon who has been convicted of two or more serious and/or violent felonies in the past, and most recently had a firearm readily available for use, curry also argues that because section 1170.126 was drafted to exclude certain specified crimes from sentencing reliefthose crimes listed as serious and/or violent felonies under sections 667.5, subdivision (c) and 1192.7that list would have included felony possession of a firearm if it were intended to be a disqualifying crime. (see dyna-med, inc. v. fair employment & housing com. (1987) 43 cal.3d 1379, 1391, fn. 13 6 involves exclusion of other things not exprethe firearm, without arming, is not a disqualifying crime. and in this case, the trial court determined defendant did not mepeople v. white, supra, 243 cal.app.4th at p. 1364.) osuna, curry had the weapon available for use; the record demonstrated the weapon was loaded and within his grasp when he was first sighted by the police. the trial court did not err. disposition the order denying the petition is affirmed. zelon, j. we concur: perluss, p. j. garnett, j.* * judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
