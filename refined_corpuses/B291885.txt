(people v. flores (2014) 227 cal.app.4th 1070, 1075 (flores) [second appellate district, division six]; people v. garcia (2014) 230 cal.app.4th 763, 769-770 (garcia) [third appellate district].) we agree with flores and garcia that the term pritchett challenges capable of exercising discretion, justly applying the public safety exception, and determining whether a lesser sentence would (flores, supra, 227 cal.app.4th at p. 1075.) the fact that flores and garcia were decided prior to johnson v. united states (2015) ___ u.s. ___ [135 s.ct. 2551, 192 l.ed. 2d 569] (johnson) does not alter our analysis. johnson held the statutory definition of unconstitutionally vague. (johnson, supra, 135 s.ct. at pp. 2555, 2557-2558.) the residual clause at issue in johnson was held crime, not to real-world facid. at p. 2557.) proposition 36, by contrast, ties the definition of the term pritchett challenges to tangible real-world factors. the meaning subdivision (g) of section 1170.126, which explains that a trial criminal conviction history, disciplinary record and record of rehabilitation while incarcerated, and any other evidence the 14 court determines to be relevant. (see garcia, supra, 230 cal.app.4th at p. 769.) the statute is not void for vagueness.6 2. the trial court did not abuse its discretion abused its discretion by concluding he posed an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. eligibility for resentencing is not at issue. an eligible defendant may be the court, in its discretion, determines that resentencing the petitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public ( 1170.126, subd. (f); see  1170.126, subd. (e); people v. valencia (2017) 3 cal.5th 347, 354 [220 cal.rptr.3d 230, 237].) the prosecution bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that a petitioner poses an unreasonable risk of 6 the fifth ame[n]o person shall . . . be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due he life, liberty, or property under a criminal law so vague that it fails to give ordinary people fair notice of the conduct it punishes, (johnson, supra, 135 s.ct. at p. 2556.) we are skeptical of whether the void for vagueness doctrine applies to instances such as this, where the challenged law is not a statute that would deprive an individual of his or her life, liberty, or property in the first instance, but rather is an ameliorative statute being applied retrospectively with the possibility of restoring liberty that has already been taken. because the parties do not address these issues, however, we need not reach them. 15 danger to public safety. (people v. superior court (kaulick) (2013) 215 cal.app.4th 1279, 1305.) as mentioned above, in determining whether a petitioner poses an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety, the criteria s criminal conviction history, including the type of crimes committed, the extent of injury to victims, the length of prior prison commitments, and the remoteness of the crimes; [] (2) [t]he petis disciplinary record and record of rehabilitation while incarcerated; and [] (3) [a]ny other evidence the court, within its discretion, determines to be relevant in deciding whether a new sentence would result in an unreasonable risk of danger to ( 1170.126, subd. (g).) b . . in the trial court, imust not be disturbed on appeal except on a showing that the court exercised its discretion in an arbitrary, capricious or patently absurd manner that resulted in a manifest miscarriage of justice. (people v. williams (2013) 58 cal.4th 197, 270-271;  1170.126, subd. (g).) applying this deferential standard, we find no abuse of discretion. as noted above, in a 16-page memorandum of decision, the court carefully weighed the various factors, noting some cut in favor of suitability and others did not. in making its ruling that pritchett would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety if released, the court properly focused on his chronic substance abuse, history of committing crimes fueled by substance abuse, numerous recent substance abuse-related rvrs, lack of concrete substance abuse treatment plans if released, and recent minimizing of or dishonesty about his substance abuse problems. for these reasons, we reject 16 -arguments that the court abused its discretion because his parole plans were sufficient; his decades-old criminal history did not make him a current unreasonable risk of danger to public safety; his recent disciplinary record shows he needs substance abuse treatment rather than more time in prison; and the trial court erred in its analysis of his classification scores. nothing about the trial coucapricious. (see williams, supra, 58 cal.4th at pp. 270-271.) pritchett also argues the trial court abused its discretion by basing its decision in part on unsubstantiated claims. specifically, he argues one of his rvrs was not supported by credible evidence because it was based on an anonymous note stating he would assault a guard if he remained in general population, was engaging in loan sharking, and might engage in violence if people did not repay their debts. even assuming the rvr was not supported by credible evidence, we find no abuse of discretion, because the rvr pritchett complains of played little substance abuse issues described above. 17 disposition affirmed. not to be published in the official reports currey, j. we concur: willhite, acting p. j. collins, j.
