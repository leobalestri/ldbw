(d), 1170.12, subd. (b)), and had served nine prior prison terms within the meaning of section 667.5, subdivision (b). according to the preliminary hearing transcript, both counts were based on an incident in a courthouse in which appellant orally threatened and attempted to strike a deputy. pursuant to a plea agreement, appellant pleaded no contest to count 1. the court found a factual basis for the plea, and dismissed count 2 and the other allegations. under the plea agreement, the court sentenced appellant to 16 months in prison to run concurrently with his sentence in another unrelated case. the court also imposed a restitution fine of $400 ( 1202.4, 1202.45), required fees and assessments ( 1465.8(a)(1); gov. code,  70373). appellant filed a notice of appeal. we appointed counsel to represent appellant in the matter. after examining the record, counsel filed a wende brief raising no issues on appeal and requesting that we independently review the record.

(people v. mendez (1999) 19 cal.4th 1084, 1088.) a defendant may, however, obtain review on appeal of so-noncertifi issues2 if the notice of appeal states such grounds. (ibid.) here, appellant does not challenge the validity of his plea. instead, his notice of appeal indicates that his appeal is based on the sentence or other matters after the plea that do not affect the validity of the plea. he did not, however, identify any noncertificate grounds in his notice of appeal nor submit a brief or letter advancing any such grounds. further, our own review has not identified any noncertificate issue warranting appellate review. accordingly, the judgment is affirmed. disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published. rothschild, p. j. we concur: chaney, j. johnson, j. 2 noncertificate issues are: the denial of a motion to suppress evidence under . . . section 1538.5 or s that arose after entry of the plea and do not affect .
