(a)(1))1 and possessing an assault rifle ( 30605, subd. (a)). the jury also found true the allegations that adams committed the offenses for the benefit of a criminal street gang ( 186.22, subd. (b)(1)(a)). adams admitted he had a prior conviction for a felony that was a serious felony within the meaning of section 667, subdivision (a)(1), and a serious or violent felony within the meaning of the three strikes law. ( 667, subds. (b)-(i), 1170.12.) the court sentenced adams to a prison term of 12 years, which included a five-year enhancement under section 667, subdivision (a)(1). adams argues that substantial evidence does not support his convictions and the true findings on the gang allegations and that the trial court erred by admitting certain photographs into evidence. because s arguments has merit, we affirm the convictions. we remand, however, for the trial court to exercise its discretion whether to strike the five-year sentence enhancement under section 667, subdivision (a)(1). factual and procedural background a. adams posts pictures of himself on facebook holding a rifle, and the police arrest him on march 14, 2016 someone shot and killed a man believed in retaliation for 1 undesignated statutory references are to the penal code. 3 the shooting several hours 20s neighborhood bloods. police recovered numerous 7.62 millimeter casings from the scene, indicating that the gun used to shoot the was most likely an ak47 assault rifle. a week later, adams, who wabloods, exchanged hostile messages on facebook with a user nina bkang. s messages sai adams also sent nina bkang two photographs showing adams holding what appeared to be an ak47 assault rifle. ak47 assault dthat has been used to commit a crime. in september 2016 los angeles police department officers arrested adams in connection with the march 14, 2016 murder of the man suspected to be a member of the adams initially told detectives the gun shown in the facebook it was an ak47. he said he ed to use it i wanted to prove myself. but every time i got this close to going to do something adams said he bought the gun for $1,000 but had it only a few weeks before his roommate stole it. to the point where i think maybe, well, i was coming to the conclusion where i was gonna try to do something stupid, and it 4 name, but said his first name was darryl. adams said he had not seen darryl or the gun since march 2016. the people bloods with murder and charged adams with possession of a firearm by a felon and possession of an assault rifle. the people alleged adams committed both offenses for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with a criminal street gang with the specific intent to promote, further, or assist in criminal conduct by gang members. the people also alleged adams suffered a prior serious or violent felony conviction within the meaning of the three strikes law and section 667, subdivision (a)(1). b. the jury convicts adams, and the trial court sentences him adams first trial ended in a mistrial because the jury could not reach a verdict. at the beginning of his second trial, counsel for adams objected to the admission of two photographs the people obtained from the instagram account of another member of the , . while in jail awaiting trial, adams told another fellow gang member, christopher griffiths, that daniel had the stolen ak47. police that included a photograph daniel posted on march 5, 2016 showing him holding a rifle and a pistol. another photograph posted on march 1, 2016 showed daniel with two other men, one of whom was holding a rifle. the people intended to introduce testimony from a firearms to be the same type of modified ak47 as the gun appearing in the photographs adams posted on facebook. counsel for adams 5 e too prejudicial and lacked foundation to tie adams to the gun depicted in the photographs. the trial court overruled s objections and admitted the instagram photographs at trial. during trial the peoplefirearms expert, detective james yoshida, testified s photographs was a modified ak47 known as a mak-90 (or . he compared the photographs and explained the rifles had the same modifications, including their -style buttstock, the foregrip that is clearly a modified version of a forestock as opposed to the common wood stock that is affixed to the foregrip of the ak47 detective yoshida said a firearm owner can make these modifications, but manufacturers also sell a small number of firearms with the same modifications. detective yoshida said there were two types of replica ak47 rifles, one used in the entertainment industry and the other 2 both types of replicas can cost as much as $1,000. detective yoshida stated that, in 26 years as a police officer, he had never found a replica 2 an airsoft gun is a toy weapon that uses air to propel plastic pellets at a nonlethal velocity. these weapons can nevertheless inflict pain and injury, and often closely resemble bona fide firearmsequinox holdings, inc. v. national labor relations board (d.c. cir. 2018) 883 f.3d 935, 937, fn. 1.) federal and california laws regulate the see 15 u.s.c.  5001, subd.

( 16520.) the trial court instructed the working order if it was designed to shoot and appears capable of because the definition of under purposes of this case that the people must also show the firearm pictured with adams was shootconvict adams under section 30605. much of the evidence the firearm in facebook postings was came from adams. in his interview with police officers, adams initially said the firearm but then admitted the gun was a real ak47 that he intended, until his roommate stole it from him, . adams also said the gun came with two clips he never claimed the ammunition was fake. when a the gun you have in those photos? the ones you put on 11 claimed the firearm was fake, the jury was entitled to discredit this statement and credit gun, all of which supported the conclusion adams purchased and intended to use the gun to shoot live ammunition, not water. (see people v. jones (2010) 186 cal.app.4th 216, 248, fn. 4 in re daniel g., supra, 120 cal.app.4th at p. 830 [o]n appeal, we must accept that part of the testimony which supports the .) in addition, his facebook postings were circumstantial evidence the firearm was real. officer thompson explained t weapons to rival gang members. (see people v. monjaras, supra, 164 cal.app.4th at p. 1437 defendants conduct and words in using [a firearm] constitute sufficient circumstantial evidence to support a finding that it was a firearm within the meaning of section 12022.53, subdivision (b)].)3 hile it is conceivable that the [gun] was a toy, the jury was entitled to 3 section 12022.53 provides a sentence enhancement for persons convicted of enumerated felonies who use a firearm in committing the crime. section 12022.53 adopts the definition of firearm in section 16520.

(see people v. parker (2017) 2 cal.5th 1184, 1227 [appellant forfeited the argument that evidence was 13 he also argues the trial court should have excluded the photographs because adams did not post or appear in them. a court has discretion to exclude relevant evidence under outweighed by the probability that its admission will . . . create subspeople v. jackson (2016) 1 cal.5th 269, 330; see people v. anderson (2018) 5 cal.5th 372, 402 [[t]he trial court has broad discretion both in determining the relevance of evidence and in assessing whether its prejudicial ]of discretion under section 352 will be upheld on appeal unless the court abused its discretion, that is, unless it exercised its discretion in an arbitrary, capricious, or patently absurd (people v. suff (2014) 58 cal.4th 1013, 1066; see people v. thomas (2012) 53 cal.4th 771, 806.) [u]ndue prejudice is that which uniquely tends to evoke an emotional bias against a party as an individual, while having only slight probative value with regard to the issues. (people v. jones (2012) 54 cal.4th 1, 61.) evidence is not unduly prejudicial under the evidence code merely because it strongly implicates a defendant and casts him or her in a bad light, or cumulative by failing to object during the relevant testimony]; people v. leon (2010) 181 cal.app.4th 452, 460 [appellant forfeited the argument on appeal that evidence was irrelevant because he objected at trial only on the basis of undue prejudice].) in any event, because the instagram photographs were relevant both to the charged offenses and to the gang allegations, they were not merely cumulative of other evidence admitted with respect to the gang allegations. 14 merely because the defendant contests that evidence and points to allegedly contrary evidence. (id. at pp. 61-62.) pas contemplated by [evidence code] section 352 is not so sweeping as to include any evidence the opponent finds inconvenient. (people v. doolin (2009) 45 cal.4th 390, 438-439; accord, people v. henriquez (2017) 4 cal.5th 1, 28.) to be sure, the introduction of gang-related evidence presents a danger of undue prejudice.people v. pettie (2017) 16 cal.app.5th 23, 44.) some gang evidence relating to defendants may be so extraordinarily prejudicial, and of so little relevance to guilt, that it threatens to sway the jury to convict regardless of the defendants actual guilt. (ibid.) but that is not the case here. as explained, the instagram photographs were probative of because they tended to prove the ak47 was real. the photographs also were probative on the issue of motive to possess the firearm (i.e., to intimidate rival gang members) and to prove the gang allegations. (cf. people v. hernandez (2004) 33 cal.4th 1040, 1049-1050 [where evidence of gang affiliation tends to prove motive or other elements of a charges together with a gpettie, at p. 43 [same].) the trial court did not abuse its discretion in ruling the instagram photographs were not unduly prejudicial. the photographs , as the prosecutor argued at trial, other admitted evidence arguably cast adams in an even worse light than the instagram photographs, 15 in which he did not even appear.5 facebook posts included the following statements to a rival gang member: (1) . i trained these lil niggas to kill and i show them how its done. my lil niggas is itching; (3) on bloods. and its dirty. yo homies on it. as stated, officer thompson testified that the last phrase meant adams was claiming to have an ak47 used to shoot a member of the in light of this evidence, the instagram photographs were unlikely to provoke additional emotional bias from the jury. the trial court did not abuse its discretion in concluding the probative value of the instagram photographs outweighed any probability that their admission created a substantial danger of undue prejudice.6 5 adams contends his absence from the instagram photographs is reason to exclude them, but the people demonstrated a sufficient connection between daniel and adams and their respective social media accounts for the court to admit the photographs. in addition to ahad ak47, the social media accounts of both adams and daniel included references to the march 2016 murder of a fellow gang member and photographs with the individuals ultimately charged with the retaliatory murder. 6 limiting instruction concerning the instagram photographs, after instruction the court agreed to give, however, concerned references to the retaliatory murder of a rival gang member, not the instagram photographs. 16 c. substantial evidence supported the true findings on the gang allegations adams argues substantial evidence did not support the because the hypothetical posed to officer thompson was not based on the evidence at trial. (see people v. franklin (2016) 248 cal.app.4th 938, 949 hile an expert may render an opinion assuming the truth of facts set forth in a hypothetical question, the hypothetical question must be rooted in facts shown by the evidence].) presented at trial that [adams] posted the photograph of himself holding the ak47assuming arguendo it was an ak47during the back and forth messaging with rival gang member nina but there was. the facebook records included adams correspondence with several people, including nina bkang. without corroboration that adams sent the photographs of himself holding a firearm to nina bkang. the exchange of messages between adams and nina bkang, however, continues after adams asserts it ends, and it includes both of the photographs depicting adams holding what the jury concluded was an assault rifle. each entry in the (if any). an entry dated march 22, 2016 from trayvonne adams to nina bkang at 17 17:05:06 utc7 shows an attached image of adams taking a picture of himself with his cell phone while holding an ak47. another entry dated march 22, 2016 from trayvonne adams to nina bkang at 17:05:11 utc shows an attached image of adams holding a type of ak47. thus, there was evidence to support officer hypothetical, which as stated included the fact that a gang member [posted] a selfie or a photograph of himself holding what appears to be an ak47 in a series of messages with a rival . based on assumptions of fact without evidentiary support [citation], or on speculative or conjectural factors. (people v. franklin, supra, 248 cal.app.4th at p. 949.) d. a limited remand is appropriate for the court to consider whether to strike the enhancement under section 667, subdivision (a) when the trial court sentenced adams, section 667, subdivision (a), prohibited the court from striking the five-year enhancement under that statute. (see people v. garcia (2018) 28 cal.app.5th 961, 971.) the legislature, however, has amended sections 667 and 1385, effective january 1, 2019, to give trial courts discretion to dismiss, in the interest of justice, a five-year 7 18 sentence enhancement under section 667, subdivision (a). (see cal. const., art. iv,  8, subd. (c)(1); garcia, at p. 973.) adams argues, the people concede, and we agree the new provisions apply to defendants, like adams, whose appeals are s effective date. (see people v. conley (2016) 63 cal.4th 646, 656; people v. brown (2012) 54 cal.4th 314, 323; people v. garcia, supra, 28 cal.app.5th at p. 973.) adams also argues, the people concede, and we agree that, in the words of the -year prior serious felony conviction is appropr disposition the judgment of conviction is affirmed. the matter is remanded to allow the trial court to exercise its discretion whether to strike the five-year enhancement under sections 667, subdivision (a), and 1385. segal, j. we concur: perluss, p. j. zelon, j.
