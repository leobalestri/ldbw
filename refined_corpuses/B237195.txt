[defendant] said, no. [officer bojorquez] asked [defendant] if [officer bojorquez] could search [defendant]. officer bojorquez testified that sergeant maretti arrived at the scene and was present when defendant gave his consent to search. defendant was not handcuffed or in the patrol car when he gave officer bojorquez permission to search him, and officer bojorquez did not touch defendant before beginning the search. officer bojorquez then b. at the hearing on defendantbojorquez never asked defendant for permission to search him, and defendant never gave consent to officer bojorquez to be searched. c. testimony i heard, the 1538.5 motion is denied. i find there was a consensual encounter 9 4. analysis z also testified that he then asked to the search was not credible because defendant, knowing that he had a knife in his pocket, would not have consented to a search of his person. although it may have been testimony that defendant had done so was not credible and should be disregarded. citing people v. dickerson (1969) 273 cal.app.2d 645 (dickerson), defendant versions of whether the defendant gave the law enforcement officers consent to search, id. at pp. 650-651.) the court rejected not correct. if the court found itself unable to determine whether officer helvin or miss jones were speaking the truth, it was perfectly free to draw the legal consequence from its inability, that is to say, to hold that the prosecution had not carried its burden of proof. since the id. at p. 651.) dickerson does preclude a trial court, as occurred it dickerson is inapposite because the trial court here did not state that it must believe officer bojorquez or defendant. here the trial court did not suggest that it was unable to determine who was speaking the truth. two-second conversation with defendant sergeant maretti arrived at the scene and was 10 present when defendant gave his consent to search, was not credible. notwithstanding arrived at the scene during the two-second conversation between officer bojorquez and defendant. defendant contends that assuming defendant consented to the search based on the testimony of officer bojorquez, officer bojorquez exceeded the scope of that search because officer bojorquez testified that defendant gave consent to a search only after search was necessarily limited to a patdown search pursuant to terry v. ohio (1968) 392 u.s. 1.2 we disagree. under terry v. ohio, supra, 392 u.s. 1, when an officer detains a suspect, the suspect may be armed.

(he/she) possessed the firearm only for a momentary or transitory period; 2. (he/she) possessed the firearm in order to (abandon[,]/ [or] dispose of[,]/ [or] destroy) it; [] and [] 3. (he/she) did not intend defendant requested that the proposed partial instruction under calcrim 2511 be those instructions have to do . . . with firearms. and although there is an argument to be made for transitory or momentary temporary possession, that is subsumed within the the trial court instructed the jury with a modified version of calcrim 3403, the dagger if he acted because of a legal necessity.

[] the defendant has a burden of proving his defense by preponderance of the evidence. this is a different standard of proof than beyond a reasonable doubt. to meet the burden of proof by a preponderance of the 32 evidence, the defendant must prove that it is more likely than not that each of the six 2. analysis neither section 12020, nor calcrim no. 2501 that provides the elements that must be proved under section 12020, state that transitory or momentary possession of the dirk or dagger is a defense to an alleged violation of section 12020. defendant relies upon people v. mijares (1971) 6 cal.3d 415. in that case, the defendant was convicted of possessing heroin in violation of section 11500 of the health and safety code. evidence in that case supported the conclusion that the defendant had et and had thrown it into a field, before driving his friend to a fire station to seek medical attention for a suspected drug overdose. (id. at pp. 418-419.) the supreme court held that the jury should have been instructed that momentary possession for the purpose of abandoning or disposing of the narcotic was not unlawful possession for the purposes of health and safety code section 11500.

(people v. avila trial 2. background facts prior to trial, the trial court heard argument concerning the admissibility of in the event he elected to testify, and the trial court took the matter under consideration until the following day. the 34 prior convictions and of the proposed impeachment and my ruling is as follows: the court will allow impeachment of the prior conviction for 245(c), a.d.w. on a police officer, from 2009; will allow impeachment on the prior battery on police officer or peace officer, 243.9 from 2009; and the prior conviction for p.c. 69, felony from 2005.

(stats. 2010, ch. 426,  2.) defendant was sentenced to state prison for a term of six years, and was awarded 182 days of custody credit consisting of 122 days of actual custody credit and 60 days of conduct credit. operative as of october 1, 2011, section 4019 was amended to provide one-for-one presentence conduct credits for crimes committed on or after october 1, 2011. (stats 36 to this section enacted by the act that added this subdivision shall apply prospectively and shall apply to prisoners who are confined to county jail . . . for a crime committed on or after october 1, 2011. any days earned by a prisoner prior to october 1, 2011, shall be in people v. brown (2012) 54 cal.4th 314, our supreme court rejected an argument clauses of the state and federal constitutions.

(people v. dieck (2009) 46 cal.4th 934, 939; in re marquez (2003) 30 cal.4th 14, 25-26; people v. torres (2011) 198 cal.app.4th 1131, 1151-1152.) applying this formula, defendant was entitled to 76 days of conduct credit (152 days of actual custody, divided by four, multiplying the result by two), for a total of 228 days of custody credit (152 days of actual custody credit plus 76 days of conduct credit). defendant therefore is entitled to 228 days of custody credit, not 182 days. k. calcrim 226 defendant contends that the trial court erred by instructing the jury under calcrim 226, as modified, in violation of his due process rights. we disagree. 1. background facts the trial court instructed the jury with calcrim 226, as modified, as follows: whether testimony is true and accurate, use your common sense and experience. you must judge the testimony of each witness by the same standards, setting aside any bias or testimony. consider the testimony of each witness and decide how much of it you y consider anything that reasonably tends to prove or disprove the truth or accuracy of that testimony. among the factors that you may consider are: [] how well could the witness see, hear, or otherwise perceive the things about which the witness testified? [] how well was the behavior while testifying? [] did the witness understand the questions and answer them 39 by a factor such as bias or prejudice, a personal relationship with someone involved in the case, or a personal about testifying? [] did the witness make a statement in the past that is consistent or inconsistent with his or her testimony? [] how reasonable is the testimony when you consider all the other evidence in the case? [] has the witness been convicted of a felony? [] do not automatically reject testimony just because of inconsistencies or conflicts. consider whether the differences are important or not. people sometimes honestly forget things or make mistakes about what they remember. also, two people may witness the same event yet see or hear it differently. [] if you decide that a witness deliberately lied about something significant in this case, you should consider not believing anything that witness says. or, if you think the witness lied about some things, but told the truth about others, you may simply accept the part that you think is true and 2. analysis defendant contends that the following factors included in the jury instruction been something significant in this case, you should consider not believing anything that witness says. or, if you think the witness lied about some things, but told the truth about trial court did not err in including the two challenged factors in the jury instruction. defendant admitted that he was convicted of three felony convictions for crimes of city of los angeles v. superior court (2002) 29 cal.4th 1, 21, citing people v. wheeler (1992) 4 cal.4th 284, 295-297; see also evid. code,  788.) 40 defendant contends that because the jury could disregard his entire testimony, the e court rejected a similar argument in people v. beardslee (1991) 53 cal.3d 68. in that case, the trial court be distrusted in others. you may reject the whole testimony of a witness who willfully has testified falsely as to a material point unless from all the evidence you shall believe the probability of truth favors his testimony in other particulars. [para.] however, or between his testimony and that of others, if there were any, do not necessarily mean that the witness should be discredited. failure of (id. at p. 94.) the supreme cinstruction could be applied to the testimony of defendant . . . it erroneously shifted the burden of proof. (id. at pp. 94-point requires the jury to reject any testimony; it simply states circumstances under which it may id. at p. 95.) defendant contends that the trial court erred by deleting two optional factors from testimony that he or she no longer remembers something, that testimony is inconsistent deleting those two factors from the jury instruction. defendant argues that a photograph was introduced into evidence depicting that he proves his testimony that he cut his hand when removing the knife from navarro. however, the excluded optional portion of calcrim 226 that instructs the jury that it may consider whether the witness is credible based on other consistent or inconsistent evidence is covered by the other language included in the jury instruction provided to the 41 sider anything that defendant argues that officer bojorquez testified that he could not recall how many minutes it took him to arrive at the incident scene, whether sergeant maretti was next to him or still walking up to him when officer bojorquez asked defendant whether session of his testimony, or why he had testified at the preliminary hearing that five police cars had responded to the incident scene instead of three police cars. defendant contends, therefore, that the trial court erred in deleting from the jury instruction based on estimony to be inconsistent with his or her earlier statement on a given subject if the witness testifies that he or she no longer remembers the given subject. defendant has not established that the trial court committed prejudicial error in omitting this optional portion of the jury instruction based any event, as noted above, the jury w trial court in instructing the jury based on calcrim 226, as modified. the trial court instructed the jury based on calcrim trial. if you decide that the witness made that statement, you may use that statement two ways: [] believable; [] and [] number two, as evidence that the evidence in the earlier defendant argues tthat the witness made an earlier false statement. we disagree. 42 the jury instruction provided that th-of-court statement. prove or disprove the truth or accuracy oproved their case beyond a reasonable doubt, you must impartially compare and consider all the evidence that was received throughout the entire trial. unless the evidence proves calcrim 318. disposition 228 days of custody credit consisting of 152 days of actual custody credit and 76 days of conduct credit, instead of 182 days of custody credit consisting of 122 days of actual custody credit and 60 days of conduct credit. we otherwise affirm the judgment. not to be published in the official reports. mosk, j. we concur: turner, p. j. armstrong, j.
