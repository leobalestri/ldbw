(a)).1 the jury found true a personal use deadly and dangerous weapon allegation pursuant to section 12022, subdivision (b)(1). defendant was sentenced to 26 years to life, comprised of 25 years to life for the first degree murder charge, plus one year under section 12022, subdivision (b)(1). defendant contends neither of the alternative first degree murder theories of liabilitywillful, deliberate, premeditated murder and felony murderis supported by substantial evidence. we affirm the judgment. facts family history defendant and the victim, alfonso castro,2 had known each other since 1990 when defendant began dating roxanne serbantez and alfonso did not get along. defendant and alfonso also had a strained relationship. 1 all future statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise specified. 2 because alfonso castro has the same last name as his daughter yolanda, they will be referred to by their first names for ease of reference. 3 alfonso lived with his daughter, yolanda, in a two-bedroom house in rosemeaddefendant and in 1997, defendant and serbantez moved to virginia or the fact that her mom had broken up the couple with alfonso at that time, and defendant did not enter the rosemead home after 1998. defendant and serbantez separated in 2008. night of the murder on may 24, 2008, yolanda left the rosemead home to attend a baseball tournament in san clemente. the next day at approximately 9:30 p.m., alfonso called yolanda to inform her that a man came to the house looking for her. alfs] allowed to come also not feeling well, so his sister connie parada was going to bring over soup, and yolanda planned on taking him to the doctor when she returned to town the next day. parada talked to alfonso around 11:20 p.m. to let him know she was leaving her home. parada arrived at home at 12:05 a.m. she entered the back of the house through the laundry room screen door, which was always unlocked. the screen door and laundry room were not visible to the street. inside the laundry room, parada 4 noticed that the door leading into the house was broken, scattered on the kitchen floor. parada found in the hallway outside the kitchen. she tried to use the kitchen phone to call the police, but the phone cord had been removed so she used her cell phone. neighbor woke up to the sound of fighting. he got dressed because he wanted to figure out why there was so much noise downstairs. walked downstairs and saw parada, who told him something was wrong. the neighbor walked into the kitchen and saw alfthe hallway. the investigation the investigated the homicide. sergeant joseph ramirez noticed that the kitchen phone cord was missing. after sergeant ramirez walked through the kitchen, he entered the hallway and noticed that a broken telescope and tripod were on the floor next to body. the telescope looked out of place. pieces of the telescope were scattered on the hallway yolanda later testified at trial that the telescope was always kept in the living room next to the fireplace in the front area of the home. the living room and kitchen are separated by a 5 curved hallway. the telescope was never placed in the hallway between bedrooms. d with one sock on his foot. the other sock was lying under his shoulder. that he normally kept on his bed was found undisturbed. a fuse that controlled the downstairs lighting was not fully connected. there were blood stains on the hallway walls near body. there was no blood on the broken glass in the kitchen, or anywhere else in the house. investigators collected a total of eight blood samples from the scene. one sample was taken from the hallway next to the bathroom. the small stain, which was at the height of the bathroom door handle, indicated a nearly perpendicular impact, and was of interest to the sheriff department because body was approximately nine feet down the hallway. yolanda lived in the house her entire life, and she never noticed the blood mark in the house prior to the homicide. before leaving the day before the murder, yolanda did not see a blood mark in the area of the bathroom. seven out of the eight blood samples were consistent next to the bathroom door was consistent with an unknown male. a forensic identification specialist was unable to obtain any fingerprints from the rosemead home. the coroner identified a total of 80 separate stab wounds . alfonso suffered cuts and stab 6 wounds to his face, neck, chest, abdomen, legs, back, arms, and hands. eighteen of the wounds were independently lethal. one of the wounds to neck cut through the jugular and carotid arteries and was twelve beating while the stab wounds were inflicted. defensive d that he was alive and trying to protect himself when each wound was inflicted. the coroner

deliberate, premeditated murder and felony murder. we conclude substantial evidence supports both theories of liability and affirm the judgment. evidence to support a conviction, we review the entire record in the light most favorable to the judgment to determine whether it contains substantial evidencethat is, evidence that is reasonable, credible, and of solid valuefrom which a reasonable trier of fact could find the defendant guilty (people v. avila (2009) 46 cal.4th 680, 701.) support of the judgment the existence of every fact that the trier of fact could reasonably deduce from the evidence. (people v. medina (2009) 46 cal.4th 913, 919.) standard of review is the same when the prosecution relies mainly on cpeople v. valdez (2004) 32 cal.4th 73, 104.) sufficient substantial evides verdict.

(zamudio, supra, circumstantial evidence susceptible of two reasonable interpretations, one of which suggests guilt and the other innocence, it is the jury, not the appellate court that must be people v. kraft (2000) 23 cal.4th 978, 10531054.) being . . . with malice aforethought. ( 187, subd. (a).) first . . kind of willful, deliberate, and premeditated killing . . . .( 189.) murder committed in the perpetration of burglary also constitutes murder in the first degree. (ibid.) necessary that all jurors agree on one or more of several theories proposed by the prosecution; it is sufficient that each juror is convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty of first degree murder as that offense is (people v. milan (1973) 9 cal.3d 185, (people v. guerra (1985) 40 cal.3d 377, 386; accord, people v. moore (2011) 51 cal.4th 386, 413; people v. millwee (1998) 18 cal.4th 96, 160.) 9 here, the trial court instructed the jury that it could find defendant guilty of first degree murder on either of two theories: (1) willful, deliberate, premeditated murder; or (2) felony murder based on the predicate felony of burglary. the court instructed the jury that it need not be unanimous as to which theory supported conviction. we review the sufficiency of the evidence as to both theories in turn. willful, deliberate, premeditated murder defendant contends there is insufficient evidence to prove premeditated murder under people v. anderson (1968) 70 cal.2d 15 (anderson). the california supreme court in anderson identified three factors that may support a finding of premeditation and deliberation in certain combinationsplanning, motive, and the nature of the killing. these categories, anderson show that this court sustains verdicts of first degree murder typically when there is evidence of all three types and otherwise requires at least extremely strong evidence of [planning activity] or evidence of [motive] in conjunction ([anderson, suprapeople v. perez (1992) 2 cal.4th 1117, 1125 (perez).) but these factors in certain combination are not the only means for establishing premeditation and deliberation. (people v. lenart (2004) 32 cal.4th 1107, 1127; perez, supra, 2 cal.4th at p. 1125 anderson factors, while helpful for 10 purposes of review, are not a sine qua non to finding first people v. thomas (1992) 2 cal.4th 489, 517 (thomas) anderson for a definition of premes ultimate duty inference that the killing was the result of preexisting reflection and weighing of considerations rather than mere (people v. solomon (2010) 49 cal.4th 792, 812.) ]he requisite reflection need not span a specific or extended period of time. thoughts may follow each other with great rapidity, and cold, calculated judgment may be arrived at quickly. people v. nelson (2011) 51 cal.4th 198, 213.) people v. bloyd (1987) 43 cal.3d 333, 348.) we follow these guiding principles here. we conclude there was sufficient evidence from which death. the jury was presented with significant circumstantial evidence from the crime scene to support a strong inference of planning. based on their past relationship, defendant was familiar with the layout of and was also aware that he was unwelcome there. the evidence of the break-in supports an inference that defendant intended to enter the house undetectedhe entered the house around midnight, from the back, and at a place not visible from the street. defendant took steps to surprise alfonso, breaking in by shattering the glass on the 11 back door to gain entry. although the glass in the back door was shattered and scattered all over the kitchen floor, there was no trace of dblood on the door or inside the kitchen, which suggests that he either used some implement to break into the house or took some other precaution to avoid being cut. coming through the back entry led defendant into the kitchen, where parada and investigators later discovered that the kitchen phone had been rendered inoperable. inference that defendant planned the murder by disconnecting the phone before the attack. the testimony of the forensic expert established that alfonso was stabbed with a kitchen knife, supporting the inference that defendant either brought a knife with him or circumstance, the jury could reasonably find dof a knife to support a finding of premeditation. evidence ee people v. steele (2002) 27 cal.4th 1230, 1250; see also people v. elliot (2005) 37 cal.4th 453, 471.) alternatively, the jury could infer that defendant took a kitchen knife after breaking in, but before he attacked alfonso. given the absence of any evidence of a struggle or blood in the kitchen far end of the hallway away from the kitchen, d12 carrying a knife from the kitchen into another room to attack alfonso equally supports premeditation and deliberation. (see perez, supra, 2 cal.4th at p. 1127 [going into kitchen in search of a knife after first knife broke supports an inference of premeditation].) the layout of the home and the physical evidence militates against the theory that defendant grabbed a knife instinctively while in the throes of a fight. the nature of the killing also supports the finding of a violent and bloody death sustained as a result of multiple stab wounds can be consistent with a finding of premeditation.people v. pride (1992) 3 cal.4th 195, 247umerous blows to the neck and vital organs . . . including a blow that penetrated [one blows were intended to kill rather than merely wound. (see [people v. lewis (2009) 46 cal.4th 1255, 1293] [the people v. williams (2018) 23 cal.app.5th 396, 411; accord, people v. harris rodriguez without provocation directly in the heart with enough force to penetrate part of a rib and pierce entirely people v. elliot (2005) 37 cal.4th 453, 471 [jury could constrthree potentially lethal knife wounds, not to mention almost eighty other stab and slash wounds to [the] ; people v. san nicolas (2004) 34 cal.4th 614, 658concluded that 13 defendant was intent upon killing [the victim] due to the sheer number of wounds on [her] body, many of which individually would have been fatal.) defendant stabbed alfonso 80 times in vital areas such as the neck, heart, and lungs. the force used in 18 stab wounds alone, 12 of which which cut his neck through the left jugular and carotid arteries, , further supporting a finding of deliberation. although there was no clear evidence of motive presented by the prosecution, the record does indicate that there was longstanding ill will between defendant and alfonso. defendant and serbantez had a strained relationship with alfonso even before he separated from contact with him and never went to his house. nevertheless, motivethat whatever the reason for entering the home, identify him, he determined to kill [him] to avoid perez, supra, 2 cal.4th at p. 1126 is reasonable to infer that defendant determined it was necessary to kill [the victim] to prevent [him] from school]; thomas, supra 14 finally, there was no evidence that alfonso did anything to provoke an impulsive violent response from defendant during the encounter, which lends support to the premeditated. (see people v. lunafelix (1985) 168 cal.app.3d 97, 102 [lack of provocation is a strong factor deliberate and premeditated].) sufficiency of the evidence of felony murder defendant contends there was insufficient evidence to liability. we disagree. felony murder does not require an intent to kill, but only an intent to commit the underlying felony. (people v. gonzalez occur in the midst of the commission of the felony, so long as that felony is not merely incidental to, or an afterthought to, people v. proctor (1992) 4 cal.4th 499, 532 (proctor).) in this case, the prosecution proceeded on the theory that defendant killed alfonso in the commission of a burglary. any person who enters a house with the intent to commit grand or petit larceny at the time of entry is guilty of burglary. ( 459; in re matthew a. (2008) 165 cal.app.4th 537, 540.) one may be liable for burglary upon entry with the requisite intent, regardless of whether the felony or theft actually committed is different from that originally 15 contemplated, or whether any felony or theft actually is in re matthew a., supra, 165 cal.app.4th at p. 540.) circumstantial evidence may support a felony murder convicti(people v. prince (2007) 40 cal.4th 1179, 12591260.) when be inferred from all the facts and circumstances revealed by the evidence, because (proctor, supra, at p. 533.) defendant first argues there was no evidence to [defendant] said or did anysteal. manner and timing of entrythrough the back door at midnightreflects an intent to covertly enter the home for some nefarious purpose. the evidence that the telescope was moved within a short that he intended to commit burglary when he entered. (see people v. kwok or spatial proximity between the entry and the target or predicate crime are factors that may reasonably be considered by the jury when determining whether the that no direct evidence established defendant personally moved the telescope is of no moment, as the jury could reasonably infer 16 he did so based upon the ordinary location. perpetrator take something from the house is incorrect. burglary does not require that the intended larceny be committed or even attempted. (people v. davis (1998) 18 cal.4th 712, 718.) we also the telescope was not valuable, did not appear valuable, and california law, the item of property need only have some people v. martinez (2002) 95 cal.app.4th 581, 586587 [ration stamps, empty cigarette carton, and use of soap, shampoo and hot water have slight intrinsic value to constitute larceny].) the telescope at issue meets this low threshold of having slight intrinsic value. the evidence in his favor. that is not our role. 17 disposition the judgment is affirmed. moor, j. i concur: kim, j. judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution. baker, acting p.j., concurring there was no substantial evidence at trial that would support a felony murder theory of first degree murder. i concur in the result reached by the majority, however, because presentation of the felony murder theory to the jury was harmless.
