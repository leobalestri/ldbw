(a))1 with criminal street gang and firearm use enhancements. ( 186.22, subd. (b)(1)(c), 12022.53, subd. (d).) we modify the section 186.22, subdivision (b)(1)(c) 10-year enhancement. we affirm the judgment in all other respects. ii. background a. the shooting on april 18, 2010, defendant and a fellow gang member, luis ramirez, appeared uninvited at a baptism party. the party was being held within the neighborhood claimed by their gang. defendant and mr. ramirez helped themselves to beer. after approximately one hour, someone asked defendant and mr. ramirez to leave. edgar and marcos guevara and their friend, pedro mendoza, were invited guests.2 edgar and marcos are brothers. none of the three were gang members. mr. mendoza is the victim in this case. edgar saw defendant arrive at the party. edgar recognized defendant as they had met on several occasions. on one of those prior occasions, defendant said he was a gang member. on another occasion, defendant yelled out his gang affiliation during a fistfight. edgar testified that when defendant and mr. ramirez first arrived at the party at the party, they looked around and stared at everyone. another invited guest, noelia maldonado, testified she was afraid of defendant and mr. ramirez because they were gang members. 1 further statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise noted. 2 because edgar and marcos have the same surname, to avoid confusion, we will refer to them by their first names. 3 marcos and mr. mendoza left the party near midnight. defendant and mr. ramirez left the party a few seconds later. marcos and mr. mendoza walked to the corner. marcos went across the street and behind a van to relieve himself. upon stepping back into the street, marcos saw defendant and mr. ramirez with mr. mendoza. mr. mendoza was bent over. defendanmr. mendozawere face to face and struggling with each other. mr. ramirez was standing behind defendant. marcos said, and the three men turned towards him. defendant released mr. mendoza. defendant and mr. mendoza traded punches. as marcos crossed the street towards them, defendant pulled out a gun. mr. mendoza ran about six feet away from defendant and looked back. marcos saw defendant aiming the gun at mr. mendoza. mr. mendoza put defendant shot mr. mendoza once, in the chest. the bullet pierced mr. mendozaran away together. evidence of the size relative to each other was introduced at trial. mr. mendoza was 5 feet, 3 to 4 inches tall and weighed 120 to 140 pounds. defendant was five 5, 10 inches tall and weighed 200 pounds. b. the parties of the case was that defendant and mr. ramirez, both gang members, appeared at the party uninvited in an act of intimidation. this was a tactic the gang used to maintain its hold on the community. later, defendant encountered mr. mendoza. thereupon, mr. mendoza disrespected defendant. mr. mendoza threw punches at defendant. also, mr. mendoza taunted defendant. mr. mendoza did not exhibit fear of defendant. having been disrespected in front of a fellow gang member, defendant was obligated, under an unwritten gang mandate, to retaliate violently. failure 4 defendant being punished or disciplined by his fellow gang members. the defense theory of the case was that this was a personal altercation between two men, unrelated to the gang. defendant, while at the party, had danced with a young lady named jennifer perez. ms. perez was mr. mendozacurrent or former girlfriend. that defendant had danced with ms. perez upset mr. mendoza and led to the subsequent confrontation between the two men. further, because it was personal, mr. ramirez did not get involved. c. the investigation law enforcement officers executed a search warrant at d26, 2010. when they announced their presence, defendant tried to escape through a back door. detectives mitchell loman and brandt house interviewed defendant at the lennox mendoza was killed. initially, defendant admitted he was a gang member, that he crashed the baptism party and that he but defendant denied shooting mr. mendoza. when asked who the u was talking to her. . . . i seen your defendant admitted hearing ms. perez was mr. mendozaut defendant said ms. perez told him she did not have a boyfriend. eventually, defendant admitted having an altercation with mr. mendoza. defendant described mr. mendoza as the aggressor. defendant described mr. mendoza as mendoza outside the party: something like . . . he was all big and bad, you know. and he head-butted me and shit . . as a result of the head butt and a bottom one were chipped. defendant related: 5 i was in his face, i was gonna hit him because he head butted me, but he told me i , [.] the head butt, according to defendant, things what he called mr. mendoza ran. when mr. mendoza was 10 to 20 feet away, defendant fired one shot. ahen i shot - mendoza was under the influence of alcohol or drugs. s story, there was evidence at trial nobody saw him dance with ms. perez. prior to trial, noelia maldonado told detectives she saw either defendant or mr. ramirez dancing with ms. perez. at trial, however, testifying for the defense, ms. maldonado denied seeing either defendant or mr. ramirez dancing with ms. perez. further, as noted, defendant testified mr. mendoza was angry. this allegedly occurred because he danced with ms. perez. edgar and marcos both testified they did not see defendant argue or fight with anyone at the party. moreover, according to edgar, mr. mendoza was not angry at the party. marcos testified: mr. mendoza was happy; mr. mendoza was not angry or upset; and mood did not change when defendant arrived at the party. when he left the party, mr. mendoza was not angry or upset. at no time did marcos hear mr. mendoza arguing with defendant. d. testimony concerning criminal street gangs detective arevalo testified for the prosecution. detective arevalo had 14 years of experience as a law enforcement officer. detective arevalo had more than 5 years of experience as a gang detective . 6 detective arevalo testified as follows: consistent with gang culture generally, deence turned on fear and respect; gang members sought respect within the gang and in the community; and the gang cultivated fear in the community. detective arevalo described defendant as an active gang member at the time of the crime. defendant had gang tattoos, which demonstrated his allegiance to the gang. gang graffiti in the neighborhood included defegang alias myspace page contained photographs of him with fellow gang members making gang signs. according to detective arevalo: dincluding, occasionally, murder; members normally committed crimes in pairs; this allowed each to serve as both backup and as and one way in which defeattending nongang parties uninvited. its umbrella. that unwritten mandate requires that if a gang member is disrespected, he must retaliate with violence. and the failure to do so will result in punishment or discipline by the gang. a failure to respond to disrespect also diminishes a memstature within the gang. conversely, the more violent the response, the greater the respect earned. in response to hypothetical questions tracking the facts of this case, detective arevalo testified the shooting was committed for the benefit of ddetective arevalo reasoned as follows. even if the fight started over a young woman, the gang member who shot mr. mendoza was disrespected by a nongang member. and this affront occurred in the presence of a fellow gang member. if the person who fired the shot did operated under the aegis of the mexican mafia where this form of retaliation is mandatory. martin flores testified criminal street gangs. mr. flores was a member of the superior c panel. mr. flores also ran a 7 youth center in watts. mr. flores viewed . the photograph depicted defendant with alexander tapia, a known -mr. flores described mr. tapia as a neighborhood legend, the equivalent of a celebrity. mr. flores agreed with detective arevalo the mexican mafia has an unspoken edict concerning responding to disrespect with violence or facing the consequences of the failure to do so. mr. flores described the potential consequences as isolation for a period of time or being required to execute a mission. mr. flores disagreed, however, based on a hypothetical inquiry, that the crime was committed to benefit the gang of the person who fired the fatal shot. mr. flores testified it was a personal conflict only. iii. discussion a. the gang enhancement allegation was properly charged 1. def defendant argues the gang enhancement allegation was twice dismissed and, under section 1387, subdivision (a) could not be refiled. we disagree. the gang enhancement allegation could properly be the subject of a finding it was true. 2. procedural background a. case no. ya077906 on april 29, 2010, a complaint was filed charging defendant with murder committed for the benefit of a criminal street gang. on january 21, 2011, following a preliminary hearing, a magistrate held defendant to answer on the murder charge, but dismissed the gang enhancement allegation under section 871. on february 1, 2011, the 8 prosecutor filed an information charging defendant with murder together with the gang bsequent section 995 dismissal motion, a judge, agreeing with the magistrate, dismissed the gang enhancement allegation. the prosecutor, after obtaining an unfavorable indicated ruling on gang evidence admissibility, dismissed the case. b. case no. ya081619 (the present case) on july 7, 2011, the prosecutor charged defendant by complaint in the present case with murder committed for the benefit of a criminal street gang. the prosecutor also filed a peremptory challenge against the magistrate who had ruled adversely to the prosecution on the gang enhancement allegation in case no. ya077906. a preliminary hearing was held before a different magistrate. we express no opinion as to whether the first magistrate could properly be the subject of a peremptory challenge. at the conclusion of the second preliminary hearing, defendant moved to dismiss the gang enhancement allegation on both insufficient evidence and successive prosecution the magistrate held defendant to answer on both the murder charge and the gang enhancement allegation. on august 9, 2012, the prosecutor subsequent motion to dismiss the gang enhancement allegation on grounds it had been twice litigated was denied. 3. the allegation could properly be refiled defendant argues section 1387, subdivision (a) barred further prosecution of the gang enhancement allegation. preliminarily, we disagree with the attorney gassertion defendant forfeited this argument by failing to cite section 1387, subdivision (a) in the trial court. defendant specifically argued the gang enhancement allegation had been twice dismissed and was therefore barred. this was sufficient to preserve the claim. 9 dour reasoning turns on two statutes, sections 739 and 1387, subdivision (a). section 739 provides that once a defendant has been held to answer on a complaint, the prosecutor must file an information in the superior court. in addition, section 739 states, in part [i]t shall be the duty of the district attorney . . . to file . . . an information . . . which may charge the defendant with either the offense or offenses named in the order of commitment or any offense or offenses shown by the evidence taken before the magistrate to have been committed.section 739 authorizes the prosecutor to file an information charging a transactionally-related matter that was not included in the magistrsupported by the preliminary hearing evidence. (people v. san nicolas (2004) 34 cal.4th 614, 653-654 & fn. 8; people v. slaughter (1984) 35 cal.3d 629, 633.) section 1387, subdivision (a) limits successive prosecutions. (people v. traylor (2009) 46 cal.4th 1205, 1212; burris v. superior court (2005) 34 cal.4th 1012, 1016-1018.) section 1387, subdivision (a) provides, with exceptions not chapter, or section 859b, 861, 871, or 995, is a bar to any other prosecution for the same offense if it is a felony . . . and the action has been previously terminated pursuant to this chapter, or n the meaning of section 1387, subdivision (a) includes an enhancement. (people v. carreon (1997) 59 cal.app.4th 804, 805-810; cf. ramos v. superior court (1982) 32 cal.3d 26, 34 [special circumstance allegation].) here, the action, that is, the enhancement allegation, was terminated only oncewhen defendants section 995 motion was granted. (people v. superior court (martinez) (1993) 19 cal.app.4th 738, 745-746; compare ramos v. superior court, supra, 32 cal.3d at pp. 35-36; bodner v. superior court (1996) 42 cal.app.4th 1801, 1802-1806; dietrick v. superior court (2013) 220 cal.app.4th 1472, 1474-1477.) the first action, case no. ya077906, was the first and only termination of the action within the meaning of section 1387, subdivision (a). there was no second termination of the enhancement allegation within the meaning of section 1387, subdivision (a). as division four of the court of appeal for this appellate district held in people v. superior court 10 (martinez), supra, 19 cal.app.4th at page 745: section 871 at the preliminary hearing does not terminate the action. the action continues [when the prosecution files] an information . . . under the same case number pursuant to section 739. . . . the action is terminated when the superior court dismisses (see berardi v. superior court (2008) 160 cal.app.4th 210, 219.) therefore, the prosecutor was authorized to charge the gang enhancement allegation in the present case. ( 739; berardi v. superior court, supra, 160 cal.app.4th at pp. 219-227; people v. superior court (martinez), supra, 19 cal.app.4th at pp. 745-746.) b. the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it denied bifurcate trial of the gang enhancement allegation motion to try the criminal street gang enhancement allegation separate from the underlying offense. evidence of gang affiliation, activity and culture may be introduced where relevant to prove, for example, identity, motive or intent. (people v. mckinnon (2011) 52 cal.4th 610, 655; people v. hernandez (2004) 33 cal.4th 1040, 1049 (hereafter, hernandez, supra); people v. gonzalez (2005) 126 cal.app.4th 1539, 1550.) our supreme court has held: membership, signs, symbols, beliefs and practices, criminal enterprises, rivalries, and the likecan help prove identity, motive, modus operandi, specific intent, means of applying (hernandez, supra, 33 cal.4th at p. 1049; see people v. mendoza (2000) 24 cal.4th 130, 178.) nevertheless, a trial court has discretion to bifurcate trial of the criminal street gang enhancement allegation to avoid undue prejudice to the defendant. (hernandez, supra, 33 cal.4th at pp. 1048-1050; cf. people v. calderon (1994) 9 cal.4th 69, 72 [prior conviction enhancement].) our review is for an abuse of discretion. (hernandez, supra, 33 cal.4th at p. 1048; people v. arauz (2012) 210 cal.app.4th 1394, 1403.) 11 there was no abuse of discretion in the present case. the gang evidence was intertwined with the facts of the case. it was relevant to all of the circumstances surrounding the charged offense including and intent in shooting mr. mendoza. their encounter occurred in the first place only because defendant appeared uninvited to a nongang party in his ritory. defendant did so in an effort to intimidate community members . without abusing discretion, the trial court could find the gang evidence was necessary to explain why defendant shot mr. mendoza. moreover, the evidence explained why defendant shot mr. mendoza, who was running away. as defendant, an admitted gang member, told the mr. mendoza occurred rritory. and it occurred i fellow gang member. the gang culture evidence helped to explain the significance of those facts, including people v. hernandez, supra, 33 cal.4th at pp. 1048-1051; people v. gonzalez (2012) 210 cal.app.4th 724, 737-738; people v. funes (1994) 23 cal.app.4th 1506, 1518; people v. martin (1994) 23 cal.app.4th 76, 80-82.) for the foregoing reasons, there was no s or fair trial rights. (see people v. valdez (2012) 55 cal.4th 82, 134; people v. carter (2003) 30 cal.4th 1166, 1196.) c. could properly be admitted and relied upon by the jury in a series of interrelated arguments, defendant challenges testimony on multiple grounds. defendant primarily contends: there was no proper arevalo improperly offered an state of mind; and, as a result, there was insufficient evidence to . a trial court has broad discretion to admit 12 opinion testimony concerning gangs. (people v. ramos (2004) 121 cal.app.4th 1194, 1205; people v. valdez (1997) 58 cal.app.4th 494, 506.) we conclude detective could properly be admitted and relied upon by the jury. 2. there was a proper foundation s testimony defendant argues there was no proper foundation for detective arevaldefendant asserts the assumptions, conjecture and speculation. defendant further contends: ] arevalo based his testimony on d told him and booking records. . . . [detective] arevalo also relied upon hearsay from gang her asserts: assumed facts contrary to those shown by the evidence. the evidence showed that this was a fight over a woman, that neither [defendant] nor [mr.] ramirez said anything about it is well established that a properly qualified witness may present opinion testimony about gang culture including territory, membership, rules, signs, symbols, beliefs and practices, criminal enterprises and rivalries. (e.g., people v. xue vang (2011) 52 cal.4th 1038, 1044; people v. mckinnon, supra, 52 cal.4th at pp. 653-656; people v. gonzalez (2006) 38 cal.4th 932, 944; hernandez, supra, 33 cal.4th at p. 1049; people v. gardeley (1996) 14 cal.4th 605, 617.) the admissible evidence includes gang rules, practices and tactics. (e.g., people v. castenada (2000) 23 cal.4th 743, 746, 753 [robberies wcontrol]; people v. cervantes (2004) 118 cal.app.4th 162, 168 [reasonably foreseeable someone would be shot when gang members exit car in rival gang territory carrying loaded weapons]; in re jose p. (2003) 106 cal.app.4th 458, 464-465 [intimidating note 13 -467 [gang factions followed same bylaws as a certain prison gang]; people v. hall (1998) 67 cal.app.4th 128, 133 [robberies generally committed in groups of three to six gang members]; people v. garcia (1998) 63 cal.app.4th 820, 835 [throwing gang signs at rival gang member would be met by violence]; people v. olguin (1994) 31 cal.app.4th 1355, 1377 [gang member would expect violent reaction when gang names and slogans shouted out]; people v. roberts (1992) 2 cal.4th 271, 298 [gang rule that a backup must help a hit man who is having trouble with a hit]; people v. mcdaniels (1980) 107 cal.app.3d 898, 902 [gang member entering rival territory would expect violent confrontation].) such an opinion could properly rest on the facts of the case together with an experienced knowledge of the gang and its culture. (people v. albillar (2010) 51 cal.4th 47, 70-72; people v. gardeley, supra, 14 cal.4th at p. 619.) the proper basis for a gang opinion include: personal observations and experience (people v. olguin, supra, 31 cal.app.4th at p. 1370; people v. gamez (1991) 235 cal.app.3d 957, 966-969, disapproved on another point in people v. gardeley, supra, 14 cal.4th at p. 624, fn. 10); people v. valdez, supra, 58 cal.app.4th at pp. 509-511; see people v. williams (2009) 170 cal.app.4th 587, 621); conversations with gang members (people v. gardeley, supra, 14 cal.4th at p. 620; people v. gonzalez, supra, 38 cal.4th at pp. 948-949, fn. 4; people v. vy (2004) 122 cal.app.4th 1209, 1223, fn. 9; people v. duran (2002) 97 cal.app.4th 1448, 1463; people v. olguin, supra, 31 cal.app.4th at p. 1370; people v. gamez, supra, 235 cal.app.3d at p. 967); personal investigations of gang-related crimes (people v. gardeley, supra, 14 cal.4th at p. 620; people v. vy, supra, 122 cal.app.4th at p. 1223, fn. 9; people v. duran, supra, 97 cal.app.4th at p. 1463; in re ramon t.

(see people v. woods, supra, 226 cal.app.4th at p. 1044). detective arevalo rested his opinions on: conversations with gang members incarcerated in the county jail; investigations of gang-related crimes, including crimes daily conversations with gang members on the street; interviews with witnesses to gang-related crimes; communications with other law enforcement agencies; field identification cards; arrest reports; booking records and other law enforcement records; and girlfriends and family members. under the authority cited above, these were all proper bases for detective s. 3. detective arevalo could properly testify a hypothetical crime was committed to benefit a gang dhypothetical questions, that the described crime was committed to benefit a gang. opinion testimony as to whether a described crime was gang related is relevant and admissible in a case such as the one before us. (people v. xue vang, supra, 52 cal.4th at p. 1049, fn. 5; people v. albillar, supra, 51 cal.4th at p. 63; people v. gardeley, supra, 14 cal.4th at p. 619; people v. morales (2003) 112 cal.app.4th 1176, 1197; people v. ferraez (2003) 112 cal.app.4th 925, 930-931.) here, detective arevalo was asked to assume hypothetical facts tracking those of the present case. he then offered the opinion that the hypothetical crime was committed to benefit the gang. the detective further testified defendant and 15 mr. rodriguez were fellow gang members. they crashed a baptism party within the everyone. later, defendant encountered mr. mendoza. mr. mendoza disrespected defendant in the presence of mr. rodriguez. as noted, defendant gang appeared uninvited at parties within its territory; this was done under an mexican mafia edict, a gang member who is disrespected in the presence of another gang member must retaliate with violence; and if the gang member does not respond with violence, he will face discipline by the gang. detective arevalo articulated a rational connection between the prand the rules motivating gang membopinion that the hypothetical crime was committed to benefit the gang. under these circumstances, it was reasonable for the jury to conclude the present crime was committed for the benefit of depeople v. albillar, supra, 51 cal.4th at pp. 70-72; people v. gardeley, supra, 14 cal.4th at p. 619.) 4. ind defendant argues detective arevalo improperly testified to state of mind. courts of appeal have held that a gang investigator, for example, may not offer an opinion as to a particular , that is, the knowledge or intent. (people v. killebrew (2002) 103 cal.app.4th 644, 647 (killebrew, supra); accord, in re frank s. (2006) 141 cal.app.4th 1192, 1197-1199.) but, even if correctly decided (see people v. gonzalez, supra, 38 cal.4th at p. 946), killebrew cannot be read as barring a detective from testifying, through the use of theoretical questions, regarding a hypothetical person. (people v. xue vang, supra, 52 cal.4th at p. 1047 & fn. 3; people v. spence (2012) 212 cal.app.4th 478, 508; people v. garcia (2007) 153 cal.app.4th 1499, 1513-1514). moreover, properly qualified peace 16 officers may testify about what a typical gang member would do when faced with a particular set of circumstances. (e.g., killebrew, supra, 103 cal.app.4th at p. 652 [gang members would expect rival gang to retaliate as a result of a shooting]; people v. lee (2000) 85 cal.app.4th 706, 718-719 [retaliation is an integral function of asian gangs]; people v. olguin, supra, 31 cal.app.4th at p. 1371 [typical gang member would expect violent confrontation after gang name shouted out].) here, detective arevalo did not testify as knowledge or intent. detective arevalo did not testify that defendant committed the present crime for the benefit of the gang. detective arevalo testified about a hypothetical person. moreover, detective arevalo merely explained how a latino gang member would be expected to act when confronted with a specific situation. the trial court did not abuse its discretion in permitting detective arevalo to so testify. 5. detective arevalo did not testify that defendant committed murder and any such contention has been forfeited defendant argues the hypothetical questions improperly permitted detective arevalo to testify that defendant committed murder. a properly qualified witness may answer hypothetical questions closely tracking the facts; and express an opinion as to whether the crime was committed for the . (people v. xue vang, supra, 52 cal.4th at pp. 1044-1053; people v. gardeley, supra, 14 cal.4th at pp. 618-619.) here, tan opinion about whether or not that murder was committed for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with a criminal street gang with the specific intent to promote, further, or assist in cr that . . . the reason that the male hispanic and the . . . gang member initially started fighting was over a girl, would that change your opinion that the murder was committed 17 defendant did not object to these questions in the trial court. as a result, he forfeited his argument. (evid. code,  353, subd. (a); people v. gutierrez (2009) 45 cal.4th 789, 818-189; people v. valdez, supra, 58 cal.app.4th at p. 505.) in any event, the questions properly referred to a hypothetical person and not to defendant. (people v. gonzalez, supra, 38 cal.4th at p. 946, fn.3; people v. xue vang, supra, 52 cal.4th at pp. 1046-1049.) hence, detective arevalo did not testify that defendant committed the crime. the hypothetical questions assumed the crime of murder had been committed. detective arevalo was not asked to express an opinion whether the hypothetical person had committed the crime of murder. detective arevalo was not asked to express any (people v. ward (2005) 36 cal.4th 186, 210; see people v. torres (1995) 33 cal.app.4th 37, 47-48.) these questions and the responses hereto do not provide a basis for a reversal. 6. detective arevalo did not vouch for his investigation and any such argument has been forfeited defendant asserts detective arevalo improperly vouched for the investigation of the case when the following occurred during cross-examination: have you ever testified that a crime was not for the benefit of, in association with a criminal street gang with the specific intent to promote the criminal activity of a gang?
