[citation.] the record must disclose substantial evidence to support the verdicti.e., evidence that is reasonable, credible, and of solid valuesuch that a reasonable trier of fact could find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. [citation.] in applying this test, we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution and presume in support of the judgment the existence of every fact the jury could reasonably have deduced from the evidence. [citation.] subject to justifiable suspicion do not justify the reversal of a judgment, for it is the exclusive province of the trial judge or jury to determine the credibility of a witness and the truth or falsity of the facts upon which a determination depends. [citation.] we resolve neither credibility issues nor evidentiary conflicts; we look for substantial evidence. [citat [citation.] s verdict. (people v. zamudio (2008) 43 cal.4th 327, 357; see also jackson v. virginia (1979) 443 u.s. 307.) 5 section 290, subdivision (b), of the sex offender registration act requires every person convicted of certain offenses to register in the city he or she is residing within five working days of coming into or changing his or her residence in any city or county.3 (see also people v. garcia (2001) 25 cal.4th 744, 750.) a person is guilty of a felony if he or this registration requirement. ( 290.018, subd. (b); garcia, at p. 752.) ( 7.) logically one cannot purposefully fail to perform an act without knowing what act requirement that citation.] consistent with that requirement, and accordingly, a violation of section 290 requires actual know(garcia, at p. 752.) to find that a person willfully violated the registration requirement, the people thus must prove that the defendant had actual knowledge of the duty to register. (ibid.; people v. sorden (2005) 36 cal.4th 65, 71.) here, defendant, on june 30, 2010, registered his address at his apartment on hazelhurst place. but, according to moses, defendant was evicted from his apartment around may 2010 and was living at the voa since july or august 2010. defendant also told officer zepeda, who testified, that he had stopped living at his apartment in june 2010 . he admitted to zepeda he was in violation of his registration requirement. defendant did not, however, re-register his address at the voa or at s. he did not register an address change until months later, on january 28, 2011, by which time he was living with moses. in addition to this overwhelming evidence that defendant violated his registration requirement, there was evidence he willfully did so; namely, he had actual knowledge of the requirement to re-register. defendant complied with his registration obligations prior to june 2010. officer greenbaum testified that when defendant registered on june 30, 3 the act also imposes an annual registration requirement, namely, within five 6 2010, defendant read the requirements and affixed his initials to the registration document to indicate he understood them. although notice alone does not necessarily satisfy the willfulness requirement, a jury may infer knowledge from notice. (people v. garcia, supra, 25 cal.4th at p. 752.) initial lie to officer zepeda that he was still living in his hollywood apartment and subsequent admission to zepeda that he knew he had violated the registration requirement, ii. the trial court did not have a duty to further instruct the jury on defendant next contends that the trial court failed sua sponte to instruct the jury on duty. general principles of law that are commonly or closely and openly connected to the facts before the court and that are necessary for the jury (people v. montoya (1994) 7 cal.4th 1027, 1047; see also people v. moye (2009) 47 cal.4th 537, 548; people v. breverman (1998) 19 cal.4th 142, 154.) in addition to instruction on the elements of the charged offense, a court has a sua sponte duty to define any term that has a technical legal meaning different from its common meaning. (people v. elam (2001) 91 cal.app.4th 298, 307; people v. mccleod (1997) 55 cal.app.4th 1205, 1216.) section 290, subdivision (b), provides that every person described in subdivision [,] while residing in california, . . . shall be required to register with the chief of police of the city in which he or she is residing, . . . within five working days of coming into, or changing his or her residence[.] is to enable local law enforcement agencies to keep known sex offenders under surveillance. (people v. gonzales (2010) 183 cal.app.4th 24, 32; people v. horn (1998) 68 cal.app.4th 408, 417.) the jury was instructed that a violation of section 290 required the people to prove: exual offense for which he had to register as a sex offender under penal code section 290; [] two, the 7 defendant resided in the city of los angeles; [] three, the defendant actually knew he had a duty under penal code section 290 to register as a sex offender and that he had to register within five working days of changing his residence or becoming homeless within that county; and, [] four, the defendant willfully failed to register as a sex offender with the chief of police of the city of los angeles within five working days of changing his residence or becoming homeless within that county. [] someone commits an act willfully when he or she does it willingly or on purpose. [] more addresses where someone regularly resides, regardless of the number of days or nights spent there, such as a shelter or a structure that can be located by a street address. a residence may include, but is not limited to, houses, apartment buildings, motels, hotels, homeless shelters, and recreatio (calcrim no. 2752.) defense counsel did not object to the instruction. defendant argues reside a technical meaning under section 290, and therefore either the trial court erred in not defining it or his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance by not requesting a clarifying instruction. the defendant in mccleod made a similar nnot[ing] more required. . . . [t]he registration requirement is used as an aid to law enforcement in locating sex offenders and a fair reading of the words in accordance with this use contemplates notification by the offender when he is in a place where he is living or people v. mccleod, supra, 55 cal.app.4th at pp. 1218-1219.) in any event, the jury here was instructed with a more specific definition of mccleod. here, the jury was instructed that [r]of the number of days or nights spent there, such as a shelter or a structure that can be located by a street address. a residence may include, but is not limited to, houses, apartment buildings, motels, hotels, homeless shelters, and recreational and other 8 (see also  290.011, subd. (g).) this definition is more specific than that in mccleod, people v. gonzales, supra, 183 cal.app.4th at p. 36.) defendant does not specify why this definition was inadequate. he instead argues [r]eside means more than passing through or presence for a limited visit. to reside is to temporarily or permanently dwell in a place, which one keeps and to which one intends to return, as opposed to a place where one rests or shelters during a trip or a transient visit. gonzales disagreed that a similar supplemental instruction was necessary. (people v. gonzales, supra, 183 cal.app.4th at p. 37.) the court found that the instruction given there, which was similar to the ibid.) we agree that no additional explanation was required especially where, as here, the jury asked for no further moreover, had the jury believed that defendant had no residence, that is, was a transient, then they would have found him not guilty of the charge, given the definition of residence.4 the jury, however, must have believed that defendant, as he told moses, was living at the voa or, alternatively, going back and forth between in any event, there was no evidence defendant was a transientthat is, someone with no residence. defendant made a bare statement to officer zepeda that he defendant told the officer he was bouncing back and forth betwe 4 defendant was not charged with violating the transient registration requirement in section 290.011, a misdemeanor. 9 as for defendants related contention that trial counsel was ineffective for failure to propose further instructions on the definition of reside, it is reasonable to conclude that counsel would have thought it a frivolous action in light of this authority finding the term readily understandable. defendant therefore has failed to establish ineffective assistance of counsel on direct appeal. (people v. gonzales, supra, 183 cal.app.4th at p. 37; see also people v. riel (2000) 22 cal.4th 1153, 1202.) disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports aldrich, j. we concur: klein, p. j. croskey, j.
