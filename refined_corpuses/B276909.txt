(cal. const., art. i,  17; people v. regalado (apr. 14, 2015, b255074) [nonpub. opn.] (regalado i).) we remanded the matter to the trial court for resentencing. (regalado i, supra, b255074, at p. 2.) on august 19, 2015, the trial court resentenced defendant to 39 years to life on count 3; a concurrent term of 39 years to life on count 2; and 25 years to life on count 9, for a total of 64 years to life. (people v. regalado (apr. 5, 2016, b266688) [nonpub. opn.] (regalado ii).) defendant again appealed, and on april 5, 2016, we again reversed and remanded the matter for resentencing; we directed that all further proceedings be heard by a new judge. (regalado ii, supra, b266688, at p. 2.) 1 all further statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise indicated. 3 on remand, defendant filed a romero motion.2 the people opposed his motion. after entertaining oral argument, the trial counts 2 through 5. the trial court sentenced defendant to 53 years to life as a third-strike defendant, comprised of four years for count 9, plus 10 years for the two prior conviction enhancements ( 667, subd. (a)(1)), and 25 years to life for count 3, plus four years for being personally armed with a firearm in the commission of the offense ( 12022, subd.

(a)(1)). defendant again appeals, renewing his argument that his sentence amounts to cruel and unusual punishment. the people request that we affirm the judgment, but correct the assessments imposed on defendant by increasing his criminal conviction assessment to $240 and by increasing his court operations assessment to $320. unconstitutional. we also agree with the people that the two assessments must be corrected and increased. we therefore affirm and modify the judgment. 2 people v. superior court (romero) (1996) 13 cal.4th 497 (romero). 4 factual background the underlying facts are summarized in our prior opinion. (regalado i, supra, b255074, at pp. 35.) briefly, on may 29, 2012, defendant was home with his wife. defendant was drunk. defendant and his wife had an argument, and defendant threatened to kill his wife. he pointed a shotgun at her head. he threatened to bury her alive. at one point, he grabbed her by the throat and instructed her to open her mouthwas scared that defendant was going to kill her; she was able to get away and go to the police station. on june 10, 2012, defendant and his wife again engaged in an argument. defendant again pointed a shotgun at her and threatened to kill her. while defendant was in the county jail, he attempted to dissuade his wife from testifying against him. summarized in regalado i. in 2006, defendant argued with a neighbor, retrieved a gun, and fired a shot in the air. in 2010, he argued with other neighbors and threatened to shoot them. procedural background after we remanded the matter a second time, the trial court romero motion. at that hearing, the trial court indicated that it had read the probation report, the transcript of the original sentencing by the prior judge, and the two court of appeal opinions. it then recounted defencriminal history. 5 the trial court went on to describe the facts underlying defendanconvictions, defendant had a hand grenade in his house when he was arrested and that he was out on probation for his second strike when he committed the present offenses. the trial court also commented that defendant mouth so he could put the gunthe s based rt preliminarily found that it would only be appropriate to grant the romero telephone calls from jail. defense counsel then argued that defendant had rehabilitated himself in prison, had never actually hurt anyone, and his actions did not rise to the level of a terrorist or murderer. thereafter, the trial court adopted its preliminary g of appeal had not ordered it to grant a romero motion. defendant was sentenced to 53 years to life. discussion i. son sentence defendant contends that his sentence of 53 years to life violates both the united states and california constitutions [his] offenses and 6 a. eight amendment a sentence is cruel or unusual under the eighth rummel v. estelle (1980) 445 u.s. 263, 271; ewing v. california (2003) 538 u.s. 11, t unconstitutional. he committed violent felonies that displayed, as the trial court noted, her, and threatened to bury her alive. he grabbed her by the throat and told her to open her mouth, presumably so that he could put the shotgun inside it. his abuse of his wife was part of a long cycle of endangering and threatening victims with weapons. his past strikes included firing a gun into the air during an argument with a neighbor and threatening to shoot two other neighbors. indeed, defendant was on probation for his prior criminal threat conviction at the time of the current l history and current violent felonies provide a strong justification for his lengthy sentence. b. california constitution disproportionate to the crime for which it is inflicted that it shocks the conscience and offends fundamental notions of human people v. norman (2003) 109 cal.app.4th 221, 230.) in making that determination, courts consider the nature of the offense and offender, and compare the sentence with sentences imposed for more serious crimes in california and for the same crime in other jurisdictions. (ibid.; see in re lynch (1972) 8 cal.3d 410, 424427.) 7 1. nature of the offense and offender sentence is constitutional. substantial criminal history falls well within the spirit of the law. he has a felony conviction for negligently discharging a firearm in 2006 (the first strike), a criminal threats conviction in 2010 (the second strike), and then serious crimes on three different occasions in the current casepointing a gun at his wife and threatening to kill her on may 29, 2012, and june 10, 2012, and then trying to dissuade her from testifying in december 2012. moreover, the evidence demonstrates that defendant is a head and body. while he has not caused physical harmyethe emotionally terrorized his wife when he threatened to kill her and threatened to bury her alive. and, instead of taking responsibility for his misconduct, defendant attempted to recidivism, and his attempts to evade responsibility, defendant presents a serious danger to his wife and others in the community. 2. punishments in the same jurisdiction for different offenses defendant complains that he was sentenced more harshly than numerous infamous criminals. in regalado i, we noted that the original 113-year sentence was far greater than typical sentences imposed for first-time offenders for making criminal threats and attempting to make criminal threats, which ranged from just under five years to nearly 25 years. the 53-year sentence we now review is more in line with these other sentences, particularly when we 8 al history and his status as a third strike offender. (accord, people v. cline (1998) 60 cal.app.4th 1327, 1338 (cline) ross compare sentences for first-time offenders with sentences for third strike offenders].) 3. punishment for the same offense in different jurisdictions recidivists with punishment for recidivists in other states shows that many of the statutory schemes provide for life imprisonment for repeat offenders, and several states provide for life is part of a nationwide pattern of statutes calling for severe cline, supra, 60 cal.app.4th at p. 1338.) unlike the initial 113-year sentence that was the product of running three three strikes sentences consecutively, the current 53-year sentence is the product of a single three strike sentence in conjunction with other non-three strike sentences and enhancements; the current sentence is consistent with the recidivist statutes enacted in other states. c. structions in urging reversal, defendant contends that the new trial imposing such a lengthy sentence. we disagree. the trial court 60 years, from 113 years to life to 53 years to life. crimes, keeping in mind regalado i and regalado ii, when it sentenced defendant. 9 finally, we note that defendant offers no legal authority to support his contention that he should be resentenced to a term of no more than 10 years in prison. ii. court assessments the people request that we correct the assessments imposed on defendant by increasing his criminal conviction assessment to $240 and his court operations assessment to $320. an unauthorized sentence may be corrected at any time. (people v. dotson (1997) 16 cal.4th 547, 554, fn. 6.) pursuant to government code section 70373, subdivision (a), a $30 fine assessment. (see also people v. lopez (2010) 188 cal.app.4th 474, 480.) moreover, section 1465.8 provides for a court people v. woods (2010) 191 cal.app.4th 269, 271, 274.) because defendant was convicted of eight offenses, his criminal conviction assessment should be $240 and his court operations assessment should be $320. 10 disposition the criminal conviction assessment imposed against defendant is increased to $240 and the court operations assessment is increased to $320. the clerk of the trial court is directed to correct the abstract of judgment to reflect these changes and to forward an amended abstract to the department of corrections and rehabilitation. as modified, the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. _______________________, acting p. j. ashmann-gerst we concur: _________________________, j. hoffstadt _________________________, j. * goodman * retired judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
