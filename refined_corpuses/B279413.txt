(carrillo i, supra, b145538 at pp. 2-3.) the parties stipulated that carrillo was a convicted felon. they also stipulated that the 18 baggies of methamphetamine recovered fr7.25 net grams. a narcotics officer opined that the methamphetamine was possessed for purposes of sale. (carrillo i, supra, b145538 at p. 3.) 2. jury verdict and sentencing a jury convicted carrillo of possession of a controlled substance for sale (health & saf. code,  11378; count 1), transportation of a controlled substance (id.,  11379, subd. (a); count 2), and possession of a firearm by a felon (former  12021, subd. (a)(1), now  29800, subd. (a)(1); count 3.) as to counts 1 and 2, the jury also found carrillo was personally armed with a 4 firearm in the commission of the offenses within the meaning of section 12022, subdivision (c). (carrillo i, supra, b145538 at p. 2.) carrillo waived a jury trial on the alleged prior convictions, and the trial court found carrillo had four prior convictions under the three strikes law ( 667, subds. (b)-(i), 1170.12) and three prior convictions for which he served separate prison terms ( 667.5, subd. (b)). the court imposed consecutive sentences of 25 years to life under the three strikes law on count 1 for possession for sale of a controlled substance and on count 3 for possession of a firearm by a felon, for a total aggregate term of 50 years to life. the court imposed a concurrent sentence on count 2 for transportation of a controlled substance, but in carrillo i we modified the judgment to stay the term imposed on count 2 pursuant to section 654. (carrillo i, supra, b145538 at pp. 5-8.) the trial court stayed the enhancements for being personally armed with a firearm in the commission of the offenses and struck the prior prison term enhancements. (carrillo i, supra, at p. 2.) b. on february 8, 2013 carrillo filed a petition for recall of sentence under proposition 36. he argued that the underlying offenses were not serious or violent felonies within the meaning of the three strikes law, and that none of his prior serious or violent felony convictions disqualified him from having his sentence recalled ( 1170.126, subd. (e)(3); see  667, 5 subd. (e)(2)(c)(iv), 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(c)(iv)).2 on march 8, 2013 the superior court issued an order to show cause why ntence should not be recalled. the people filed an opposition to the petition in which they asserted carrillo was ineligible for resentencing under section the current offense, the defendant . . . was armed with a firearm or deadly weapon . . . 667, subd. (e)(2)(c)(iii), 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(c)(iii).) the people also argued the defendant was unsuitable for resentencing based on his criminal history and his poor performance on probation and parole. in his reply, carrilarmed . . . in the commission or attempted commission of a felonypeople v. bland (1995) 10 cal.4th 991, 1002 (bland), requires that the armingfacilitative nexus(italics omitted.) carrillo also pointed to evidence of his suitability for resentencing under proposition 36. on november 14, 2016, after hearing argument of counsel, finding he was ineligible for resentencing because he was armed with a firearm during the commission of the underlying offenses. o 2 no. ka002865. three of the strikes were for shooting at an inhabited dwelling or occupied vehicle in violation of section 246; a fourth strike was for an aggravated assault in violation of section 245, subdivision (a). 6 statutorily ineligible for recall and resentencing pursuant to . . . section 1170.126[, subdivision] (a) because during the commission of the current offense [carrillo] was armed with a firearm; in fact, carrillo timely appealed. discussion a. the three strikes reform act of 2012 (proposition 36) prior to approval of proposition 36, the three strikes law provided that defendants who committed a felony and had two or more prior convictions for serious or violent felonies were to be sentenced to an indeterminate term of life imprisonment with a minimum term of at least 25 years. (former  1170.12, subds. (b), (c)(2)(a); people v. perez (2018) ___ cal.5th ___, ___ [2018 wl 2090909 at p. 2] (perez); people v. estrada (2017) 3 cal.5th 661, 666-667 (estrada).) following enactment of proposition 36, defendants are now subject to a lesser sentence when they have two or more prior strikes and are convicted of a felony that is neither serious nor violent, unless an exception applies. [citations.] (estrada, supra, 3 cal.5th at p. 667.) a defendant falls within one of the offense, the defendant used a firearm, was armed with a firearm or deadly weapon, or intended to cause great bodily injury to 667, subd. (e)(2)(c)(iii), 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(c)(iii).) 7 proposition 36 applies both prospectively and retroactively to defendants who were previously sentenced under the three strikes law. (estrada, suprafor those sentenced under the scheme previously in force, [proposition 36] establishes procedures for convicted individuals to seek resentencing in accordance with the new sentencing rules. ( 1170.126.) the procedures call for two determinations. first, an inmate must be eligible for resentencing. ( 1170.126, subd. (e)(2).) an inmate is eligible for resentencing if his or her current sentence was not imposed for a violent or serious felony and was not imposed for any of the offenses described in clauses (i) to (iv) of section 1170.12, subdivision (c)(2)(c). ( 1170.126, subd. (e)(2).) those clauses describe certain kinds of criminal conduct, including the use of a firearm during the commission of the offense. second, an inmate must be suitable for ibid.) because the supreme court has issued three opinions relating to a finding of ineligibility for resentencing under proposition 36 based on the defendant having been armed with a firearm or deadly weapon during the commission of the current offense, we invited the parties to submit supplemental briefing perez, estrada, and people v. frierson (2017) 4 cal.5th 225, 230, 236.3 we address these decisions below. 3 both carrillo and the people have submitted supplemental letter briefs. 8 b. proposition 36 ineligibility does not require a facilitative nexus between the arming with a firearm and the underlying offense a defendant is ineligible for resentencing if during the firearm or deadly weapon . . . 667, subd.

(e)(2).) been statutorily defined and judicially construed to mean having a firearm [or weapon] available for use, either offensively or defensively. [citation.] it is the availability of and ready access to the weapon that constitutes arming. [cpeople v. cruz (2017) 15 cal.app.5th 1105, 1109-1110 (cruz); accord, bland, supraa defendant is armed if the defendant has the specified weapon available for use, either people v. osuna (2014) 225 cal.app.4th 1020, 1029 (osuna), disapproved on another ground in people v. frierson, supra, 4 cal.5th at p. 240, fn. 8.

(see, e.g., merriam-ollegiate dict. (11th ed. 2003) a minimum, a need for a temporal connection between the although the need to establish such a nexus imposes certain limits on the applicability of the firearm-related exception, [proposition 36] could certainly have imposed an even stricter requirement for triggering the exception. (see [bland, supra,] 10 cal.4th [at p.] 1002 . . in the 11 commissionfacilitative nexusbecause [proposition 36] does not do so, we may infer some kind of temporal limitation on the retroactive application of section estrada, supra, 3 cal.5th at p. 670, fn. omitted.) carrillo points out that the court in estrada qualified its holding by stating in footnote 4 that [w]hether the use, arming, and intent described in section 1170.12, subdivision (c)(2)(c)(iii) must have a more-than-coincidental relationship to the current (estrada, supra, 3 cal.5th at p. 670, fn. 4.) however, although the court expressly did not decide whether more than a relationship between the arming and the offense was required to make a defendant ineligible for resentencing, the court made clear that proposition 36 could have imposed the blandestrada, supra, 3 cal.5th at p. 670.) estrada, our colleagues in division six of this district concluded the people need not arming and the underlying offense for a defendant to be ineligible for resentencing under proposition 36. (cruz, supra, 15 cal.app.5th at pp. 1111-1112.) in cruz, the court affirmed the resentencing under proposition 36 based on his use of a weapon during the commission of the current offense even though the jury found not true the allegation the defendant used a knife in the commission of the offense. (id. at p. 1111.) the court section 12022, subdivision (b)(1),] applies only if the knife had a facilitative nexus in the 12 commission of the offense. [citations.] proposition 36 turns on [d]uring the commission of the 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(c)(iii) . . .), which is diin the commission 12022, subd. (b)(1) . . .). er words, it requires a temporal nexus between the arming and the sid. at pp. 1111-1112;5 accord, osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1032 [proposition 36 does not require a facilitative nexus for a defendant to be ineligible for resentencing].) we conclude, as did our colleagues in division six, that a temporal nexus between the arming and the underlying felony, not a facilitative onscruz, supra, 15 cal.app.5th at pp. 1111-1112.) c. the superior court erred in using a preponderance of the evidence standard, but the error was harmless the superior court used a preponderance of the evidence standard in finding that carrillo was ineligible for resentencing the current offense petitioner was armed with a firearm; in fact, 5 the court also concluded on the same ground that the fact the jury acquitted the defendant of assault with a deadly weapon cruz, supra, 15 cal.app.5th at p. 1111.) 13 supreme court has cthat proposition 36 permits a trial court to find a defendant was armed with a deadly weapon and is therefore ineligible for resentencing only if the prosecutor proves perez, supra, __ cal.5th at p. ___ [2018 wl 2090909 at p. 1]; accord, people v. frierson, supra, 4 cal.5th at pp. 230, 236.) the people concede that the superior court improperly applied a preponderance of the evidence standard, but contend the error was harmless because the evidence at trial established specifically, they point to the undisputed evidence at trial that carrillo had two loaded firearms in his vehicle. according to [t]he further, the jury found that carrillo was a felon in possession of a firearm and that he was personally armed with a firearm in the commission of the offenses within the meaning of section 12022, subdivision (c). (carrillo i, supra, b145538at p. 2.) thus, by its verdict, the jury necessarily found that carrillo knew the firearms were in his vehicle. (see caljic no. 12.44 [to find a defendant guilty of possession of a firearm by a felon, the jury must find the presence of the . . 17.16.1 [to find the allegation true that the defendant was personally armed in the commission of the 14 . . or have it available . . . for offensive or defensive 6 although the superior court applied an incorrect standard but that [carrillo] was armed with a deadly weapon during the perez, supra, ___ cal.5th at p. ___ [2018 wl 2090909 at p. 1].) in perez, the defendant was convicted of assault by means likely to produce great bodily injury based on his assault of the victim with a truck. (id. at p. ___ [2018 wl 2090909 at p. 2].) the trial court granted the eligible for resentencing because he was not charged with assault with a deadly weapon, and the truck was not necessarily used as a deadly weapon. (id. at p. ___ [2018 wl 2090909 at p. 2].) the supreme court reversed, agreeing with the appellate [the defendant] used force likely to produce great bodily injury when he assaulted [the victim], and because the vehicle was the sole means by which [the defendant] applied this force, the record of conviction establishes that [the defendant] used the vehicle as perez, supra, ___ cal.5th at p. ___ [2018 wl 2090909 at p. 2].) we conclude the record here similarly shows beyond a reasonable doubt that carrillo was armed with a firearm during the commission of the current offense. carrillo had two firearms 6 although the parties have not included in the record the instructions given to the jury, we have reviewed the record on appeal in carrillo i. the trial court instructed the jury with caljic nos. 12.44 and 17.16.1. 15 in the backseat available for use during the commission of the crime of possession of a controlled substance for sale, and he had knowledge that the firearms were available for his use.7 there is error in applying a preponderance of the evidence standard was harmless, in that there is no reasonable probability of a more favorable result had the trial court applied the correct standard.
