[a] prior juvenile adjudication shall constitute a prior serious and/or violent felony conviction for purposes ii. facts of the case a. wo prior offenses 1. first prior: juvenile adjudication for assault with a firearm in 1995, in case no. pj06171, a juvenile court sustained a petition against garcia for assault with a firearm in violation of section 245, subdivision (a)(2). 2. second prior: adult conviction for voluntary manslaughter also in 1995, in case no. la032732, garcia committed an offense that led to a jury trial in 2000 and an adult conviction of first degree murder, a felony in violation of 4 section 187. in 2007, the court vacated the murder conviction, and he pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter, also a felony in violation of section 192, subdivision (a). it is n occurred in 2010 or 2013. b. offense in this case garcia and two other men committed an armed robbery together in the city of palmdale. around 5:30 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. on february 26, 2014, the 54-year-old victim had been walking alone when the three men approached in a truck. one of the three men exited the truck, displayed a gun, chambered a round, and demanded that the victim turn over his wallet and money, which the victim did. after the three men drove off, the victim reported the crime to the police, including a description of the vehicle. while the victim was on the phone with the 911 operator, the police found a during a traffic stop, the police detained the vehicle and recovered the garcia was the driver of the vehicle. the officer also recovered the and state residence card. the officer also found a gun and ammunition in the vehicle. iii. procedural history on july 17, 2014, the people filed an amended information charging garcia with second degree robbery (count 1) and possession of ammunition by a felon (count 2). the amended information alleged that garcia had a prior sustained juvenile petition for assault with a firearm and a prior felony for voluntary manslaughter. although the people alleged that both priors qualified as strikes2 under the three strikes law, the amended information only pleaded the prior felony for voluntary manslaughter qualified as a five-year serious felony enhancement under section 667, subdivision (a). garcia pleaded not guilty; on july 22 and 23, 2014, the jury convicted him of both counts. 2 a strike is a prior felony conviction or juvenile adjudication that subjects a defendant to the increased punishment specified in the three strikes law. 5 garcia admitted the two priors as felony convictions pursuant to the three strikes law, but he only admitted the prior voluntary manslaughter as basis for the five-year serious felony enhancement under section 667, subdivision (a). the trial court first asked p.c.or penal code section 245, subsection (a), subsection (2), as a felony, conviction 95 in l.a. county juvenile c case la, l code section 192, subsection (a) on 12/28/07, in l.a. county superior creplied, subsequently, subsection (1), that you suffered the following serious felony in case la032732, for 192(a) of the penal code, conviction date 12/28/2007, in l.a. county superior c garcia the trial court sentenced garcia to 11 years and 4 months, plus 25 years to life, plus two additional five-year serious felony enhancements. on count 1, in light of the two priors, the trial court sentenced garcia to 25 years to life as the base term pursuant to the three strikes law. next, the trial court added two five-year enhancements pursuant to section 667, subdivision (a)one for the prior juvenile assault with a firearm, one for the prior adult conviction for voluntary manslaughter. the trial court specifically stated: 67, subsection (a). [] defendant to serve 25 years to life as to the base term count 01, plus an additional 5 years section 667(a)(1). the sentence is further increased by an additional 5 years pursuant to trike allegations within the meaning of penal code section 1170.12(a)-(d) and 667(b)-(i), for a state prison sentence of 10 years, plus 25 years to life as to the base term count 01. [] the court states for the record that this is a 6 third strike case. the abstract of judgment indicated a 10-year enhancement pursuant to section 667, subdivision (a), that is, two five-year enhancements. on count 2, the trial court sentenced garcia to one-third of the midterm of eight months, doubled to 16 months pursuant to the three strikes law. discussion garcia argues that his prior juvenile adjudication for assault with a firearm is not a serious felony conviction pursuant to section 667, subdivision (a), and therefore the trial court erred in imposing an additional five-year serious felony enhancement based on his prior juvenile adjudication. garcia relies on people v. west (1984) 154 cal.app.3d 100 (west)conviction[s]thus -id. at p. 110.) the people do not dispute that 1995 prior was a juvenile adjudication. in their brief, the people do not address the issue of constitutes a prior conviction under section 667, subdivision (a). they instead argue the trial court did not err because juvenile adjudications can serve as strikes under the three strikes law, based on subdivisions (b) to (i) of section 667. the issue on appeal is basis for a five-year serious felony enhancement pursuant to section 667, subdivision (a). to set the base term at 25 years to life under the three strikes law, section 667, subdivisions (b) to (i). we treat subdivision (a) differently than subdivisions (b) to (i). section 667, subdivision (d) expressly mandates that a juvenile adjudication constitutes a prior felony conviction under the three strikes law, section 667, subdivisions (b) to (i): isions (b) to (i), inclusive, a prior conviction of a serious and/or violent felony shall be defined as [] . . . [] . . . a prior juvenile adjudication shall constitute a prior serious and/or violent felony conviction for purposes of sentence enhancemen( 667, subd. (d); see people v. nguyen (2009) 46 cal.4th 1007, 1015, 1028.) no such provision exists for 7 subdivision (a). in west and its progeny, based on a plain reading of the statute, appellate courts have concluded that section 667, subdivision (a) does not apply to a prior juvenile adjudication. (west, supra, 154 cal.app.3d at p. 110; people v. smith (2003) 110 cal.app.4th 1072, 1080, fn. 10; (2000) 78 cal.app.4th 1065, 1068.) as we have certain juvenile adjudications as prior felonies for purposes of the three strikes law, juvenile adjudications cannot be considered . . . a prior serious felony conviction for purposes of the mandatory five-(smith, at p. 1080, fn. 10.) garcia is thus correct that courts cannot use a prior juvenile adjudication to enhance a sentence for a subsequent adult serious felony conviction under section 667, subdivision (a). the trial court in this case erred in adding a five-year serious felony based on his prior juvenile adjudication pursuant to section 667, subdivision (a). disposition the judgment is modified by striking the five-year sentence enhancement imposed based on the juvenile adjudication pursuant to section 667, subdivision (a). the superior court is directed to prepare an amended abstract of judgment reflecting this modification and forward a copy to the department of corrections and rehabilitation. as so modified, the judgment is affirmed. not to be published. johnson, j. we concur: chaney, acting p. j. lui, j.
