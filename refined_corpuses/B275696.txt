produce great bodily injury and resisting an executive officer by use of force and violence. the jury also found true the allegation gomez personally inflicted great bodily injury on the officer. gomez contends the trial court erred in answering a jury question during deliberations and in failing to give a unanimity instruction at that time. regarding the enhancement, gomez argues substantial evidence does not support the juryfinding he personally inflicted great bodily injury on the officer, and the trial court committed instructional error by giving a modified definition of great bodily injury. the response to the jappeal. we also conclude there was substantial evidence to injury on the officer. we agree with gomez, however, that the ury instruction on great bodily injury was erroneous and prejudicial. therefore, we reverse the judgment with directions for a new trial on the great bodily injury enhancement only. factual and procedural background a. gomez is involved in a physical altercation with a police officer gomez, who is five feet six inches tall and weighs 130 because he was homeless and had nowhere else to go. he knew a 3 he wanted somewhere safe to stay. a family member called the police and reported that gomez was sleeping on the porch in violation of the court order. at 9:00 a.m. officer edward lee of the pomona police department, who is six feet tall and weighs 240 pounds, went to the house. officer lee found gomez asleep on the front porch, which was elevated four to six feet above the ground and was surrounded by a three- to four-foot ledge. officer lee climbed the porch steps and spoke to gomez, who gave the officer his name and admitted he was on parole. the two men described what happened next differently. began moving away from him, and right forearm or wrist to detain him. in response, gomez porch, pulling the officer with him. officer lee fell over the ledge and landed on his head on hard dirt, which forced his neck to snap back and caused him to lose consciousness for 15 to 30 gomez to stand and put his hands behind his back so the officer could handcuff him. gomez complied, but after he turned his back to the officer and faced the porch ledge, he decided to jump off the porch and make a run for it because he believed there was a warrant for his arrest and was scared of going to jail. as gomez was hurdling the porch ledge, he felt officer lee grab his shoulder to try to stop him. they both fell over the ledge onto the 4 that point and he never touched the officer or tried to pull him over the ledge. gomez, uninjured from the fall, got up and ran away without looking back. voice and other noises on the to check on officer lee and, when she reached him several seconds later, found him conscious and moving but disoriented. she asked officer lee if he was injured. the officer said he recover. officer lee hit the emergency button on his radio and requested backup. officer joe hernandez, the first officer on the scene, testified that when he arrived officer lee was standing in the front yard, covered in dirt and debris. his forehead was red and beginning to swell, and he seemed confused. he told officer hernandez that gomez pulled him over a wall, causing him to hit his head on the ground. officer hernandez, using a police canine, subsequently blanket. after warning gomez several times he would unleash the dog if gomez did not come out, officer hernandez gave the gomez remained motionless. when officer hernandez removed the blanket, gomez sat up, and officer hernandez punched him in the face to create distance between them. officer hernandez testified that gomez kicked toward him and punched the dog 5 started chewing on his leg he was initially in shock, and, when he moved his arms up to surrender, the dog bit his arm. once the dog bit his arm, gomez surrendered. b. gomez is tried, convicted, and sentenced the people charged gomez with one count of assault on a peace officer by means likely to produce great bodily injury (pen. code,  245, subd. (c)),1 and one count of resisting an executive officer by the use of force or violence in the performance of his or her duties ( 69). the people also alleged gomez personally inflicted great bodily injury on the officer within the meaning of section 12022.7, subdivision (a). the people alleged gomez had a prior serious or violent felony conviction within the meaning of the three strikes law ( 667 subds. (b)-(j), 1170.12), a prior serious felony conviction ( 667, subd. (a)(1)), and served a prior prison term for a felony ( 667.5, subd. (b)). the jury convicted gomez of both crimes and found true the great bodily injury allegation on both counts. after gomez admitted the prior conviction allegations, the trial court sentenced him to a prison term of 14 years, consisting of the lower term of three years on count 1, doubled under the three strikes law, plus five years for the prior serious felony conviction and three years for the great bodily injury enhancement. the court imposed and stayed execution of the one-year enhancement for the prior prison term.2 on count 2 the court imposed and 1 statutory references are to the penal code. 2 the trial court erred by imposing and staying the one-year prior prison term enhancement because the court cannot impose enhancements under both section 667 and 667.5. (see people v. langston nce the prior prison 6 stayed a term of 10 years (the upper term of three years, doubled, plus three years for the enhancement and one year for the prior prison term enhancement). gomez timely appealed. discussion a. response to the jury was erroneous during deliberations, the jury submitted the following the assault? [] is it the dual grab between ronald [and] the officer? or the single grab to the shoulder from the officer to ronal the trial court and counsel discussed the question off the sole and exclusive judges of the facts of this case. [] first, you must determine what facts have been proved from the evidence something proved by the evidence or by stipulation. [] in this case you must unanimously agree that the defendant willfully committed an act which by its nature would probably and directly result in the application of physical force on another person. you [are] directed to caljic 9.00, page 24 of the instructions. [] term is found true within the meaning of section 667.5(b), the trial court may not stay the one-year enhancement, which is mandatory unless strickenpeople v. lua (2017) 10 cal.app.5th 1004, 1020.) on remand, the trial court is to strike the section 667.5, subdivision (b), enhancement as to count 1. 7 you do not have to unanimously agree as to which act the when the court and counsel went back on the record, the was misleading and erroneous. gomez argues the court erred in directing the jury to caljic no. 9.00, which defined the elements of assault, rather than caljic no. 9.20, which addressed assault by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury. as a result, gomez argues, the jury may have used the lesser level of force required for simple assault, rather than the greater amount of force required for assault by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury. gomez also argues the last sentence of the responsetelling the jurors they did not need to agree unanimously on which act gomez committed on another personversion of events to convict him erroneously. gomez, however, forfeited these arguments because his trial counsel response. a defendant forfeits an argument the trial court erred in responding to a jury question whercounsel approved the response. (see people v. salazar (2016) 63 [c]people v. debose (2014) 59 cal.4th 177, 207 [counsel for defendant forfeited the argument the court erred in responding to a jury affirmats actions8 people v. rogers orfeits the claim of people v. roldan (2005) 35 cal.4th 646, 729 [w]another ground in people v. doolin (2009) 45 cal.4th 390, 421, fn. 22; cf.  1259 [objection at trial not necessary to preserve issue of instructional error on appeal].) by affirmatively stating, in prepared by the court and counsel was acceptable, gomez forfeited his challenge to the wording of the response. gomez argues he preserved the issue for appellate review because he raised it in his motion for a new trial. gomez relies on section 1181, subdivision (5), which provides that a trial court the first time in a motion for a new trial, however, does not preserve the issue for appeal. (see people v. williams (1997) 16 cal.4th 635, 686-687 [defendant forfeited the argument in his motion for bjected to the statement people v. cowan (2010) 50 cal.4th 401, 486 [the filing of a motion for new trial does not revive 3 3 gomez also argues for the first time in his reply brief that, question forfeited his challenge to the response, his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance. this argument, which gomez 9 b. substantial evidence supp gomez argues substantial evidence does not support the least in version of events, officer lee hurt himself accidentally when he tried to grab gomez mid-flight and fell over the conviction on [gomez] being grabbed by the officer as he was ult, conviction is challenged on appeal, we review the entire record in the light most favorable to the judgment to determine whether it contains evidence that is reasonable, credible, and of solid value from which a trier of fact could find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.

[citatioupon no hypothesis whatever is there sufficient substantial people v. manibusan (2013) 58 cal.4th 40, 87.) the same standard applies to an enhancement.

[] serious bodily injury means a serious impairment of a physical condition, including but not limited to a case law stating the terms serious bodily injury and great bodily injury are essentially equivalent.
