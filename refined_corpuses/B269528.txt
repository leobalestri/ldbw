(see smith v. robbins (2000) 528 u.s. 259, 227-284.) on september 21, 2016, we advised defendant that he had 30 days within which to personally submit any contentions or arguments he wishes us to consider. defendant filed a supplemental brief on september 28, 2016. defendant argues that the evidence did not demonstrate eric was actually struck with the purse. the argument is first degree burglary conviction. the jury found defendant guilty of first-degree burglary, which only requires that he entered an inhabited dwelling house with intent to commit grand or petit larceny. ( 459, 460, subd. (a).) we asked the parties to brief the issue of whether defendant received an excessive award of presentence custody credits. the trial court ruled defendant served 432 days of actual custody prior to trial. defendant was arrested on november 28, 2014. defendant was sentenced on january 13, 2016. defendant thus had served only 412 days of actual custody. (people v. rajanayagam (2012) 211 cal.app.4th 42, 48 [presentence custody credit begins on day of arrest and continues through day of sentencing]; people v. bravo (1990) 219 cal.app.3d 729, 735.) defendant is also entitled to 61 days of conduct credit. ( 2933.1, subd. (c); people v. cooper (2002) 27 cal.4th 38, 40.) defendant 6 thus should have received a total of 473 days of custody credits. we will modify the judgment accordingly. iv. disposition the oral pronouncement of judgment is modified to award defendant 412 days of custody credit and 61 days of conduct credits for a total of 473 days of presentence credits. upon remittitur issuance, the superior court clerk is to prepare a corrected abstract of judgment and serve it on the department of corrections and rehabilitation. the judgment is otherwise affirmed as modified. not to be published in the official reports turner, p. j. we concur: kriegler, j. kin, j. judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
