(pen. code,  667, subds. (e)(2)(a), (c), 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(c).) proposition 36 also authorizes an inmate currently serving a third-strike sentence for a nonviolent or nonserious felony to petition for resentencing under the amended statute. (pen. code,  1170.126, subds. (a)-(b).) proposition 36, however, fails to specify whether an inmate is disqualified from seeking a recall of his sentence if he was also convicted of a serious or violent felony. on october 31, 2014, thomas filed a petition to recall his sentence for evading a peace officer on the ground it is not a serious or violent crime. thomas argued he was entitled to be resentenced as a second strike offender as to that count. the trial court kidnapping, a violent felony pursuant to section 667.5, subdivision (c)(14), made him ineligible for resentencing under proposition 36. thomas timely appealed on april 3, 2015. 3 on july 2, 2015, the california supreme court resolved the ambiguity in an inmate is eligible for resentencing with respect to a current offense that is neither serious nor violent despite the presence of another current offense that is serious or violentpeople v. johnson, supra, 61 cal.4th at p. 695.) accordingly, disposition the denial of thomaster remanded for the trial court to exercise its discretion as authorized under penal code section 1170.126. bigelow, p.j. we concur: rubin, j. flier, j.
