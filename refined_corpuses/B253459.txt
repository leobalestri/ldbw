[citation.] to the extent a minute order diverges from the sentencing proceedings it purports to memorialize, it is presumed to be the product of clerical error. [citation.] likewise, the abstract of judgment cannot add to or modify the judgment which it purports to digest or summarize. [citations.] as with other clerical errors, discrepancies between an abstract and the actual judgment as orally pronounced are subject to correction at any time, and should be corrected by a reviewing court when detected on appeal. people v. scott (2012) 203 cal.app.4th 1303, 1324.) at the sentencing hearing, the trial court orally imposed a cumulative sentence of 53 years to life plus 30 years, comprising a sentence of 39 years to life plus 5 years on count 1, and a consecutive sentence of 14 years to life plus 20 years on count 2. regarding count 1, the court imposed a term of seven years to life on count 1, doubled that term pursuant to the three strikes law ( 667, subd. (e)(1), 1170.12, subd. (c)(1)), and added a term of 25 years to life pursuant to section 12022.53, subdivision (d), plus a 5-year enhancement pursuant to section 667, subdivision (a)(1). regarding count 2, the court imposed a term of seven years to life, doubled that term pursuant to the three strikes law, and added a term 2 rder and the abstract of judgment misstate his sentence, we omit a summary of the evidence presented at trial. (people v. white (1997) 55 cal.app.4th 914, 916, fn. 2; people v. mcneely (1994) 28 cal.app.4th 739, 742.) 4 of 20 years pursuant to section 12022.53, subdivision (c), plus a 5-year enhancement pursuant to section 667, subdivision (a)(1). appellant maintains that the minute order from the sentencing hearing and the abstract of judgment contain errors regarding three aspects of his sentence. respondent concedes the existence of those errors. first, regarding both counts, the minute order and the abstract of judgment reflect the imposition of a one-year enhancement under section 667.5, subdivision (b), in addition to the five-year enhancement under section 667, subdivision (a)(1). however, the trial court orally imposed no one-year enhancements pursuant to section 667.5, subdivision (b); furthermore, as our supreme court has explained, when both types of enhancement are predicated on the same offense, only the five-year enhancement may be imposed (people v. jones (1993) 5 cal.4th 1142, 1150). accordingly, the minute order and the abstract of judgment err in stating that for counts 1 and 2 each include a one-year enhancement under section 667.5, subdivision (b). second, regarding both counts, the minute order and the abstract of judgment reflect gun use enhancements under section 12022.53 not orally imposed by the court. regarding count 1, they state that the court imposed a 10-year enhancement ( 12022.53, subd. (b)) and a 20-year enhancement ( 12022.53., subd. (c)), in addition to the term of 25 years to life ( 12022.53, subd. (d)) furthermore, regarding count 2, they state that the court imposed a 10-year enhancement ( 12022.53, subd. (b)), in addition to the 20-year enhancement ( 12022.53., subd. (c)) reflected in that transcript. because section 12022.53, subdivision (f), provides that only one term of imprisonment set forth in the statute -- -- may be imposed for each crime, the additional enhancements 5 could not be imposed. those entries in the minute order and the abstract of judgment are therefore erroneous. thicumulative sentence, which is 53 years to life plus 30 years. the sentencing minute order states that the total term under count 1 is 75 years and the total term under count 2 is 50 years, resulting in a cumulative term of 125 years; furthermore, the prison time set forth in the abstract of judgment amounts to 53 years to life plus 72 years. in sum, the sentencing minute order and the abstract of judgment must be amended to correct the errors identified above. 6 disposition the trial court is directed to correct the sentencing minute order to reflect that no one-year enhancements ( 667.5, subd. (b)) or 10-year enhancements ( 12022.53, subd. (b)) were imposed on count 1 and 2; that no 20-year enhancement ( 12022.53., subd. (c)) was imposed on count 1; that the sentence imposed on count 1 totals 39 years to life plus 5 years; that the sentence imposed on count 2 totals 14 years to life plus 25 years; and that the cumulative sentence is 53 years to life plus 30 years. the trial court is further directed to prepare an amended abstract of judgment reflecting the corrections stated above, and to forward the amended abstract to the department of corrections and rehabilitation. the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports manella, j. we concur: epstein, p. j. collins, j.
