 filed 11/14/19 p. v. liebensperger ca2/4 not to be published in the official reports california rules of court, rule 8.1115(a), prohibits courts and parties from citing or relying on opinions not certified for publication or ordered published, except as specified by rule 8.1115(b). this opinion has not been certified for publication or ordered published for purposes of rule 8.1115. in the court of appeal of the state of california second appellate district division four the people, plaintiff and respondent, v. george liebensperger, defendant and appellant. b293322 (los angeles county super. ct. no. ba458460) appeal from a judgment of the superior court of los angeles county, craig j. mitchell, judge. affirmed. the law office of b.c. mccomas and brian c. mccomas, under appointment by the court of appeal, for defendant and appellant. xavier becerra, attorney general, gerald a. engler, chief assistant attorney general, lance e. winters, assistant attorney general, stephanie c. brenan and lindsay boyd, deputy attorneys general, for plaintiff and respondent. 2 george liebensperger was convicted by jury of one count of damaging jail property. (pen. code,  4600, subd. (a).)1 in this appeal, imposition of assessments and fines without determining his ability to pay, pursuant to people v. dueas (2019) 30 cal.app.5th 1157 (dueas).2 appellant concedes that he did not raise his ability to pay in the trial court. therefore, we hold that he has forfeited the issue. background3 appellant was charged by information with one count of destroying prison or jail property. ( 4600, subd. (a).) the information further alleged that he had suffered two prior convictions of serious felonies ( 667.5, subd. (c), 1192.7) and two prior strikes ( 667, subds. (b)-(i), 1170.12, subds. (a)-(d)) and served two prior prison terms ( 667.5, subd. (b)). the jury found appellant guilty. appellant waived a court trial on the prior conviction allegations and admitted the prior strike convictions. the trial court sentenced appellant to a term of four years and imposed the requisite assessments and fines, including a 1 unspecified statutory references will be to the penal code. 2 appellant previously raised the dueas issue in an appeal of a different matter. (people v. liebensperger (b293320, aug. 21, 2019) 2019 cal.app.unpub. lexis 5565 (liebensperger i).) in that matter, we held that appellant had forfeited the issue by failing to raise it in the trial court. (id. at pp. *10-*11.) 3 we need not set forth the facts of the underlying offense, which are not pertinent to this appeal. 3 restitution fine of $300, pursuant to section 1202.4, subdivision (b), and victim restitution of $1,312.50. discussion dueas imposes (1) court facilities a (under . . .  1465.8 and gov. code,  70373, respectively), or (2) a restitution fine (under . . .  1202.4). people v. hicks (2019) 40 cal.app.5th 320, 325.) appellant contends that the matter should be remanded for the trial court to determine whether he has the ability to pay the assessments and fines. appellant concedes that he did not object to the assessments and fines in the trial court, but he argues that dueas announced a new constitutional principle that could not have been anticipated at the time of sentencing. in people v. frandsen (2019) 33 cal.app.5th 1126 (frandsen), our colleagues in division eight of this appellate district addressed the same arguments appellant makes. the court concluded that the defendant forfeited the ability to challenge mandatory assessments and a restitution fine by failing to object at sentencing. (id. at pp. 1153-1155.) as we stat frandsen that the failure to object to the imposition of the assessments and fines in the trial court resulted in the forfeiture of the claim. (id. at p. 1153; see liebensperger i, supra, 2019 cal.app.unpub. lexis 5565, at p. *11.) we disagree with appellant that he raises a pure question of 4 law. whether he has the ability to pay is a factual question that should have been raised in the trial court. [appellant] was foreclosed from making the same request that the defendant in dueas made in the face of those same mandatory frandsen, supra, 33 cal.app.5th at p. 1154.) as frandsen dueas was foreseeable. dueas herself foresaw ibid.) matter. disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports willhite, j. we concur: manella, p. j. currey, j.
