(a)(1)), and one count of possession of ammunition by a felon ( 30305, subd. (a)(1)). it was also alleged she suffered three prior prison terms within the meaning of section 667.5, subdivision (b).1 the case proceeded to a jury trial in march 2015. deputy erena and detective llorens testified to the above facts. lisa tagg, an officer with the los angeles police department, testified that she was assigned to the parole compliance unit in her division. before home on collette avenue on october 8 to perform a parole compliance check with several other officers. during the on that occasion, officer she would not be violated stated that she intended to have her boyfriend hang onto the key for the gun vault to avoid incurring any parole violations. the jury found defendant guilty on both counts. defendant admitted her three prison term priors. defendant was sentenced to state prison for four years, calculated as 1 pretrial. he is not a party to this appeal. 4 follows: a two-year midterm on count 1 (possession of a firearm), plus one year each for two of the prison term priors. the court struck the third prior in the interests of justice and stayed a two-year term on count 2 (possession of ammunition) pursuant to penal code section 654. this appeal followed. defendant requested this court take judicial notice of the trial court orders issued in the los angeles superior court cases in which her three prior convictions were each reduced to a misdemeanor pursuant to proposition 47: (1) the february 23, 2015 order in case no. pa054243, (2) the may 5, 2015 order in case no. la060087, and (3) the january 20, 2015 order in case no. pa070145. respondent did not file any request for judicial notice of the three orders. (evid. code,  452, subd. (d).) discussion 1. s. defendant argues the record lacks substantial evidence she possessed either the firearms or the ammunition found inside the locked safes in her home. she contends that, at most, there was evidence she merely had access to them, but not actual or constructive possession. we are not persuaded. determine whether sufficient evidence supports a jury verdict, a reviewing court reviews the entire record in the light most favorable to the judgment to determine whether it discloses evidence that is reasonable, credible, and of solid value such that a (people v. johnson (2015) 60 cal.4th 966, 988.) possess the same contraband. (people v. williams (2009) 170 cal.app.4th 587, 625 [defendant found to possess drugs and weapons found in room used by defendant, in house owned by someone else].) possession may be imputed when the contraband is found in a place which is immediately accessible to the joint dominion and control of the (people v. miranda (2011) 192 cal.app.4th 398, 410.) 5 defendant argues the evidence showed nothing more than that she lived in a home where two locked safes containing firearms were maintained, and that such evidence is insufficient to show constructive possession. it is true that [d]ominion and control are essentials of possession, and they cannot be inferred from mere presence or access. something more must be shown to support inferring of (people v. zyduck the necessary additional circumstances may, in some fact contexts, be rather slight (ibid., italics added, citing people v. redrick (1961) 55 cal.2d 282, 285-286.) here, the evidence demonstrated there was additional evidence beyond joint access to the safes. defendant resided in the home. one of the safes was located in the bedroom she shared with her boyfriend, and the keys to that safe were found lying on the top of the dresser. the other safe was located in the hallway outside the bedroom. defendant acknowledged she knew there were guns in both safes. defendant had keep the key so she could avoid incurring any parole violations during parole compliance checks. the reasonable inference is that she had joint control of the safes in the home she shared with her boyfriend, and was consciously seeking to avoid that fact being discovered during a parole check because she knew such conduct was unlawful. such evidence was a sufficient basis for the jury to find constructive possession by defendant. (people v. redrick, supra, 55 cal.2d at pp. 287-288 [nonexclusive access or possession 2. the sentence enhancements for the two prison term priors must be vacated and stricken. defendant contends her sentence must be modified because the two prior convictions on which the court imposed sentence enhancements pursuant to penal code section 667.5 have been reduced to misdemeanors, and therefore no longer support imposition of the one-year enhancements. we agree. a one-year sentence enhancement pursuant to penal code section 667.5, subdivision (b) applies only to prior felony convictions. (people v. tenner (1993) 6 6 cal.4th 559, 563 (tenner).) at the time of her sentencing, defendant had suffered three prior felony convictions: a violation of section 666 (case no. pa054243), a violation of section 666 (case no. la060087), and a violation of section 484e, subdivision (d) (case no. pa070145). the court struck the prior conviction in case no. pa054243 in the interests of justice and imposed a one-year sentence enhancement as to each of the other two felony convictions. defendant filed petitions in the trial court pursuant to penal code section 1170.18 to have her prior convictions reduced to misdemeanors. section 1170.18 was enacted pursuant to the safe neighborhoods and schools act, adopted by the voters in november 2014 as proposition 47 (proposition 47). proposition 47 reclassified certain drug and theft-related ofcommitted by ineligible defendants. subdivision (f) of section 1170.18 provides that a person who has completed a prison term on a felony conviction that would have been a misdemeanor under the act had it been in effect at the time of the conviction, may file an application to have the prior judgment of conviction reclassified as a misdemeanor. penal code section 1170.18, subdivision (f) were granted resulting in all three of the prior convictions being reduced to misdemeanors. as noted above, we have taken judicial notice of those orders. subdivision (k) of penal code section 1170.18 provides, in relevant part, that a]ny felony conviction that is . . . designated as a misdemeanor under subdivision (g) shall be considered a misdemeanor for all purposescontends section 1170.18, subdivision (k) applies retroactively. respondent disagrees, citing people v. perez (2015) 239 cal.app.4th 24 and people v. rivera (2015) 233 cal.app.4th 1085. perez was depublished november 18, 2015, rivera is not on point as the court there was looking at the issue of appellate jurisdiction and whether the court of appeal was divested of jurisdiction because of the reduction of a felony conviction to a misdemeanor, and not whether a prior conviction reclassified as a misdemeanor can support imposition of a sentence enhancement under penal code section 667.5. 7 respondent also relies on people v. diaz (2015) 238 cal.app.4th 1323, people v. delapena (2015) 238 cal.app.4th 1414, people v. dehoyos (2015) 238 cal.app.4th 363, and people v. shabazz (2015) 237 cal.app.4th 303. however, dehoyos was depublished by a grant of review on september 30, 2015, and delapena was depublished by a grant of review on october 28, 2015. diaz and shabazz are factually inapposite because neither of the defendants in those cases had petitioned and obtained a trial court order reducing their prior convictions to misdemeanors in accordance with penal code section 1170.18. in contrast, defendant has complied with the statutory scheme and her prior convictions have been reduced to misdemeanors for all purposes. as misdemeanor convictions, they do not support imposition of a sentence enhancement pursuant to penal code section 667.5. (tenner, supra, 6 cal.4th at p. 563.) as the supreme court has as amended a statute to reduce the punishment for a particular criminal offense, we will assume, absent evidence to the contrary, that the legislature intended the amended statute to apply to all defendants whose judgments are s operative date. [citation.] we based this conclusion on the a] legislative mitigation of the penalty for a particular crime represents a legislative judgment that the lesser penalty or the different treatment is sufficient to meet the people v. brown (2012) 54 of an amendment to a criminal statute, a judgment is not final until the time for p(people v. vieira (2005) 35 cal.4th 264, 306.) proposition 47 mitigated the penalty for the offenses of which defendant was convicted in case no. pa0701452 and case no. la060087 2 apply to a prior felony conviction under penal code section 484e, subdivision (d). we are aware of other cases holding that a violation of section 484e, subdivision (d) does not 8 of conviction in this case became final. we therefore conclude that the two prior convictions in those cases should be treated as misdemeanors for purposes of her sentencing in this case and may not be used to impose greater punishment on defendant in the form of a sentence enhancement under penal code section 667.5, subdivision (b). disposition the judgment of conviction is modified as follows: the one-year term imposed pursuant to penal code section 667.5 for the prior conviction in case no. pa070145 is vacated and stricken. the one-year term imposed pursuant to penal code section 667.5 for the prior conviction in case no. la060087 is vacated and stricken. the superior court is directed to prepare and transmit forthwith a modified abstract of judgment to the department of corrections and rehabilitation. we affirm the judgment of conviction in all other respects. grimes, j. we concur: rubin, acting p. j. flier, j. fall within the purview of proposition 47, but we believe people v. romanowski (2015) 242 cal.app.4th 151, opinion modified 2015 cal.app.lexis 1081, states the better view.
