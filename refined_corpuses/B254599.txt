( 459.) defendant had sustained two prior serious felony convictions. on, january 31, 1997, defendant was sentenced to 40 years to life pursuant to sections 667, subdivisions (a)(1) and (e)(2) and 1170.12, subdivision (c)(2). we affirm the order. ii. discussion we previously affirmed defendants conviction. (people v. edwards (dec. 9, 1997, b110084) [nonpub. opn.].) we appointed counsel to represent defendant on this appeal. after examining the record, appointed appellate counsel filed an opening brief in which no issues were raised. instead, appointed appellate counsel requested that this court independently review the entire record on appeal pursuant to people v. wende (1979) 25 cal.3d 436, 441-442. (see smith v. robbins (2000) 528 u.s. 259, 277-284.) on may 13, 2014, we advised defendant that he had 30 days within which to personally submit any contentions or arguments he wishes us to consider. no response has been received. we have examined the entire record and are satisfied appointed appellate counsel have fully complied with their responsibilities. the argument defendant raised in the trial court is frivolous. defendant is ineligible for resentencing because he was convicted of first degree residential burglary, a serious felony, and sentenced to an indeterminate term of life imprisonment.
