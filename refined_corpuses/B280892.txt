it was an accident. godoy admitted knowing the gun was inherently dangerous, but he had not known whether it was loaded. shortly after the shooting he told a detective he was not scared of ramirez; he knew he could beat ramirez up because he (godoy) used to be a boxer. at trial he confirmed that he had never been afraid of ramirez and was not afraid of him the night of the shooting. godoy believed he and ramirez would eventually fight each other. experience, it was common for friends to physically fight when there was tension between them, and then smoke and drink together afterwards as if nothing had happened. godoy admitted suffering a felony conviction in 2014 for automobile burglary. 6 [e]when he arrived at her residence after the shooting. he cried, hit himself on the head with the gun, and stated he did not know what he had done. 2. procedure a jury convicted godoy of second degree murder, and acquitted him of first degree murder. ( 187, subd. (a).) it found godoy personally used a firearm ( 12022.53, subd. (b)), but found allegations he personally discharged the gun not true. (id., subds. (c), (d).) the trial court sentenced godoy to 15 years to life in prison for the murder, plus 10 years for the firearm enhancement, for a total of 25 years to life. it ordered victim restitution in the amount of $7,338.20, and imposed a restitution fine, a suspended parole revocation restitution fine, a court operations assessment, and a criminal conviction assessment. godoy appeals. discussion 1. the trial court did not commit instructional error godoy argues the trial court erred by (1) failing to sua lf-defense, and (2) declining his request to instruct on voluntary manslaughter on an imperfect self-defense theory. he contends the purported errors violated his due process rights, and require reversal. we disagree. a. additional facts the trial court instructed the jury on first and second degree murder, and on involuntary manslaughter. godoy did not request, and the court did not give, an instruction on self-defense. instruction on an imperfect self-defense or defense of others 7 theory. it concluded such an instruction would be inconsistent support a finding godoy believed he, or anyone else, was in imminent danger.2 b. applicable legal principles a trial court must instruct the jury on all general principles of law relevant to the issues raised by the evidence, including lesser included offenses, and defenses on which the defendant relies and that are not inconsistent with his theory of the case, whether or not the defendant makes a formal request. (people v. moye (2009) 47 cal.4th 537, 548; people v. abilez (2007) 41 cal.4th 472, 517.) instruction on a lesser included offense is required when there is evidence the defendant is guilty of the lesser offense, but not the greater. (people v. whalen (2013) 56 cal.4th 1, 68; people v. thomas (2012) 53 cal.4th 771, 813.) substantial evidence is evidence that a reasonable jury could find persuasive. (people v. benavides (2005) 35 cal.4th 69, 102.) the existence of any evidence, no matter how weak, will not justify instructions on a defense or a lesser included offense. (people v. whalen, supra, at p. 68; people v. wyatt (2012) 55 cal.4th 694, 698.) in deciding whether there is substantial evidence we do not 2 be instructed on accident. a trial court has no duty to sua sponte ent. (people v. anderson (2011) 51 cal.4th 989, 996-997.) the claim that a homicide was committed by accident amounts to a claim that the defendant acted without forming the required mental state, and therefore instructions on the intent or mental state requirement of the charged crime adequately convey the relevant legal principles. (id. at p. 997.) 8 evaluate the credibility of the witnesses, a task for the jury. (people v. wyatt, supra, at p. 698; people v. manriquez (2005) 37 cal.4th 547, 585.) we independently review the question of whether the trial court erred by failing to instruct on a lesser included offense or a defense. (people v. trujeque (2015) 61 cal.4th 227, 271; people v. simon (2016) 1 cal.5th 98, 133; people v. oropeza (2007) 151 cal.app.4th 73, 78.) -defense embraces two types: perfect and imperfectpeople v. rodarte (2014) 223 cal.app.4th 1158, 1168.) -defense, which exonerates a defendant completely, requires that he had an honest and reasonable belief that the use of force was necessary to defend against an imminent threat of bodily injury against himself or another, and that he used no more force than was necessary to defend against that threat. ( 197, subd. 1; people v. rodarte, supra, at p. 1168; people v. moye, supra, 47 cal.4th at p. 550; people v. hernandez (2011) 51 cal.4th 733, 747; people v. villanueva (2008) 169 cal.app.4th 41, 49-50.) imperfect self-of another human being under the actual but unreasonable belief that the killer was in imminent danger of death or great bodily people v. booker (2011) 51 cal.4th 141, 182; people v. simon, supra, 1 cal.5th at p. 132.) because the y (people v. trujeque, supra, 61 cal.4th at p. 271.) imperfect self-defense or imperfect defense of others is not a complete defense to a killing, but negates malice and reduces the offense to voluntary 9 manslaughter. (ibid.; people v. elmore (2014) 59 cal.4th 121, 134; people v. humphrey (1996) 13 cal.4th 1073, 1082.) for both perfect and imperfect self-defense, the fear must be of imminent harm. (people v. trujeque, supra, at p. 270; people v. humphrey, supra, at p. 1082.) c. the trial court properly declined to instruct on perfect and imperfect self-defense the trial court here correctly omitted a self-defense instruction, because there was no substantial evidence from which the jury could have found godoy acted in self-defense or the defense of others, and the instruction ran counter to his theory of defense at trial. godoy did not testify that he intentionally shot ramirez because he believed deadly force was required to defend himself or anyone else from an imminent attack. instead, he testified that the gun accidentally discharged shooting was purely accidental. in general, an accidental shooting is inconsistent with an assertion of self-defense. (see, e.g., people v. villanueva, supra, 169 cal.app.4th at p. 50; people v. curtis (1994-defense imports an intentional shoa trial court has no duty to sua sponte instruct on a defense that people v. nguyen instruct sua sponte on a particular defense arises only if the defendant is relying on such a defense, or if there is substantial evidence supporting the defense and it is not inconsistent with people v. barton (1995) 12 cal.4th 186, 197; people v. villanueva, supra, at p. defense is supported by the evidence but is inconsistent with the 10 godoy argues that the jury might have rejected his testimony and could have concluded he acted out of fear and in self-defense. we do not see how. certainly, a jury may credit people v. elize (1999) 71 cal.app.4th 605, 610; people v. villanueva, supra, may be disregarded by the jury in an appropriate case and will not foreclose a self-substantial evrequirements of self-defense are met]; people v. millbrook (2014) 222 cal.app.4th 1122, 1137 [substantial evidence to support an instruction may exist even in the face of inconsistencies presented by the insubstantial evidence is insufficient to require an instruction on people v. simon, supra, 1 cal.5th at p. 132; people v. trujeque, supra, 61 cal.4th at p. 272.) there was no evidence here, either circumstantial or direct, from which testimony, that he was actually afraid of the victim and purposely shot him due to a belief he was in imminent peril. godoy testified that he was not afraid of ramirez and believed he could bes there was no evidence ramirez had threatened or behaved violently toward godoy either in the past or on the night of the shooting. (see people v. trujeque, supra, at p. 272.) there was no evidence godoy thought ramirez wanted the gun to use against him11 had he obtained access to it, as godoy argues. according to godoy, he and ramirez were friends, and their only disagreement students to drugs; there was no showing ramirez was angry with godoy. godoy repeatedly challenged ramirez to fight, not vice versa, and ramirez repeatedly declined the invitation. in any -threatening situation; it was common for him and his friends to physically fight to release tension and then socialize afterwards. ramirez was unarmed, and godoy did not state he believed otherwise. when ramirez reached for the gun, he and godoy were separated by a fence, and godoy was able to step back from him. (see people v. simon, supra, at p. 134 [where the record does not contain substantial evidence showing defendant actually believed he was in imminent danger of great bodily injury or death, trial court does not err by refusing instruction]; people v. manriquez, supra, 37 cal.4th at pp. 580-583 [rejecting claim that trial court improperly refused imperfect self-defense instruction, under the foregoing circumstances, purportedly reached for the gun was not substantial evidence supporting a self-defense instruction. nor could the jury have inferred godoy was acting in testimony supported a conclusion that he believed ramirez intended to shoot the persons who were 12 there was no evidence showing any threat to these unnamed persons, who were located at another location, was imminent. no matter how great the fear and no matter how great the likelihood of the harmmust be of imminent peril must appear to the defendant as immediate and present and not prospective or even in the near future. an imminent peril is one that, from appearances, must be instantly dealt with(people v. trujeque, supra, 61 cal.4th at p. 270.) there was no evidence of such imminence here. godoy cites people v. wickersham (1982) 32 cal.3d 307, in support of his contentiothe evidence was sufficient to support a self-defense instruction. but wickersham does not assist him. there, the defendant and her husband were in the process of divorcing. according to the defendant, her husband was volatile, always seemed to be on the verge of striking her, and had sometimes worn a gun at their house. she had complained to police that he had made threats against her, had exposed a gun in a threatening manner, and had called her several times when drunk or enraged. (id. at pp. 317-318.) she testified that she accidentally shot her husband when they scuffled over a gun he discovered in a closet in their home. (id. at p. 322.) wickersham concluded there was sufficient evidence to support an imperfect self-defense instruction, given the gun and attempted to take it from her; he had previously fought her for possession of a gun; he had made previous threats on her life; and her statements after the shooting that her 13 husband went crazy and reached into a pocket where he carried a gun lent support to the imperfect self-defense theory. (id. at p. 328 & fn. 7.) wickersham background of reported threats by the victim, the jury could have an attack of this nature, would have been overcome by fear and acted to repel the attaid. at p. 327.)3 as is readily apparent, in the instant matter there is no comparable evidence showing that ramirez had ever threatened godoy, or that godoy had any reason to fear him. for the same reasons, we conclude there was no evidence from which the jury could have inferred godoy acted in imperfect self-[the imperfect self-defense] doctrine is narrow. it requires without exception that the defendant must have had an actual belief in the need for self-defense. . . . put simply, the trier of fact must find an actual fear of an imminent harm. without this finding, imperfect self-in re christian s. (1994) 7 cal.4th 768, 783.) as explained ante, there was insufficient evidence showing godoy had an actual fear of imminent harm. thus, the trial court correctly declined the proposed instruction. 3 notwithstanding its conclusion that the evidence supported an imperfect self-defense instruction, the wickersham court concluded that the trial court was not required to instruct on imperfect self-defense because the defense had not requested and was not relying upon an imperfect self-defense theory. (people v. wickersham, supra, 32 cal.3d at p. 329.) conclusion that an imperfect self-defense instruction was not required to be given sua sponte was later disapproved by people v. barton, supra, 12 cal.4th at pages 200-201. 14 in sum, even piecing together the defense and the prosecution evidence in the manner most favorable to godoy, there was no evidence that would have allowed the jury to conclude he intentionally shot ramirez in the actual belief, reasonable or unreasonable, that he or another person was in imminent danger. accordingly, there was no instructional error.4 2. the matter must be remanded to allow the trial court the opportunity to exercise its discretion pursuant to amended section 12022.53 when godoy was sentenced in january 2017, imposition of a section 12022.53 enhancement was mandatory and the trial court lacked discretion to strike it. (see former  12022.53, subd. (c), stats. 2010, ch. 711,  5; people v. kim (2011) 193 cal.app.4th 1355, 13621363.) accordingly, the trial court sentenced godoy to an additional 10-year term for his use of a firearm. ( 12022.53, subd. (b).) effective january 1, 2018, the legislature amended section 12022.53 to give trial courts authority to strike firearm enhancements in the interest of justice. (sen. bill no. 620 (2017-2018 reg. sess.), stats. 2017, ch. 682,  2.) as amended, section 12022.53 provides in pertinent section 1385 and at the time of sentencing, strike or dismiss an enhancement otherwise required to be imposed by this section. the authority provided by this subdivision applies to any supplemental briefing, godoy contends his case must be 4 arguments regarding prejudice. 15 remanded to the trial court to allow the court to exercise its discretion to strike the firearm enhancement. as the people correctly concede, the amendment to section when the amendment became operative. (people v. woods (2018) 19 cal.app.5th 1080, 1090-1091.) under in re estrada (1965) 63 cal.2d 740, we assume that, absent contrary evidence, an amendment reducing punishment for a crime applies retroactively to all nonfinal judgments. (id. at p. 745; people v. brown (2012) 54 cal.4th 314, 323; people v. vieira (2005) 35 cal.4th 264, 305-306.) the estrada rule has been applied to penalty enhancements, as well as to amendments giving the court discretion to impose a lesser penalty. (people v. nasalga (1996) 12 cal.4th 784, 792; people v. francis (1969) 71 cal.2d 66, 75-76.) although the people concede the amendments to section 12022.53 apply retroactively, they urge that remand is unnecessary because no reasonable court would exercise its discretion to strike the firearm enhancement here. (see people v. gutierrez (1996) 48 cal.app.4th 1894, 1896.) we disagree. generally, with sentencing on the erroneous assumption it lacked discretion, remand is necessary so that the trial court may have the opportunity to exercise its sentencing discretion at a new sentencing hearing. [citations.] defendants are entitled to of its discretionary authority cannot exercise its informed 16 5 (people v. brown (2007) 147 cal.app.4th 1213, 1228; people v. gutierrez (2014) 58 cal.4th 1354, 1391.) remand is required to allow the trial court to exercise its discretion, unless remand would be an idle act because the record shows the court would not have exercised its discretion even if it could have done so. (people v. gamble (2008) 164 cal.app.4th 891, 901.) not reflect that remand would be an idle act. at sentencing, the trial court obse we do not interpret this remark as an indication the trial court would inevitably have imposed the firearm enhancement, as the fact that when sentence was imposed, it had little discretion under the applicable statutes. nothing in the record indicates whether the trial court would have imposed the firearm enhancement had it possessed the discretion not to do so. (see people v. deloza (1998) 18 cal.4th 585, 599-600 [remand for resentencing appropriate where trial court did not understand it had discretion to impose concurrent rather than consecutive sentences].) accordingly, the trial court must be given the opportunity to exercise the discretion conferred by senate bill no. 620. we express no opinion about should be exercised. 5 here, of course, the trial court did not misunderstand the scope of its discretion; it did not have discretion to strike the firearm enhancement prior to senate bill no. 17 disposition the judgment of conviction is affirmed. the matter is remanded to allow the trial court to exercise its discretion and determine whether to strike or dismiss the section 12022.53, subdivision (b) firearm enhancement pursuant to section 12022.53, subdivision (h). not to be published in the official reports edmon, p. j. we concur: lavin, j. dhanidina, j. judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
