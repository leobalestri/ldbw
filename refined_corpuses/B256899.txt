(a)1 (counts 1, 3, 4, 5 and 7)); one count of continuous sexual abuse of a child under 14 years ( 288.5, subd. (a) (count 2)); one count of committing by force a lewd or lascivious act on a child under 14 years ( 288, subd. (b)(1) (count 6)); four counts of committing a lewd or lascivious act on a child of 14 or 15 years ( 288, subd. (c)(1) (counts 8, 9, 10, and 12)); and one count of sexual penetration by a foreign object with a person under 16 years ( 289, subd. (i) (count 11)). as to counts 1 to 7, the information specially alleged that arancibia had committed a specified offense against more than one victim ( 667.61, subds. (b), (c) & (e)(4)). according to the evidence at trial, all three victims were congregants of the small church of which arancibia was the pastor. the victim in counts 1, 2 and 3, who was under 14 years at the time of the charged offenses, testified that, when alone with arancibia, on multiple occasions he had kissed her and used his tongue while holding her waist or rubbing his hand on her waist under her shirt, telling her times that he would not do it again. arancibia also played her, got on top of her with his clothes on and rubbed his hard penis on her stomach, waist or private part. the victim in counts 4, 5, 6 and 7, who also was under 14 years at the time of the charged offenses, testified that arancibia had kissed her with his tongue while touching her waist under her clothes. he played tickle with her, got on top of her and rubbed his private part against her private part while kissing her neck and belly button under her clothes. once, while on a camping trip and swimming in a lake, arancibia 1 statutory references are to the penal code. 3 touched her behind with his hard penis. he also kissed her while pushing his body against hers. the victim in counts 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12, who was 14 or 15 at the time of the charged offenses, testified that arancibia had kissed her face while she was asleep in . another time he kissed her in the bathroom after she had bathed in his home. while on a camping trip arancibia came into her tent at night, put his hand underneath her shirt and touched her chest. he also put his hand on her vagina under her he rub his penis, causing him to ejaculate. a jury convicted arancibia on all 12 counts and found true the section 667.61 allegation. the trial court sentenced arancibia to state prison for an indeterminate term of 45 years to life (consecutive 15-year-to-life terms for counts 1, 2 and 6 and concurrent 15-year-to-life terms for counts 3, 4, 5 and 7), plus a determinate term of 5 years 8 months (the upper term of 3 years for count 8 and consecutive terms of 8 months each (one-third the middle term) for counts 9, 10, 11 and 12). discussion section 288, subdivision (a), punishes, as charged in counts 1, 3, 4, 5 person who willfully and lewdly commits any lewd or lascivious act . . . upon or with the body, or any part or member thereof, of a child who is under the age of 14 years, with the intent of arousing, appealing to, or gratifying the lust, passions, or sexual desires of , punishes, as charged in count [a]ny person who commits an act described in [section 288,] subdivision (a) by use of force, violence, duress, menace, or fear of immediate and unlawful bodily ubdivision (c)(1), punishes, as [section 288,] subdivision (a) with the intent described in that subdivision, and the victim resides in the same home with the minor child or has recurring access to the child, who over a period of time, not less than three months in duration, engages in . . . three or more 4 acts of lewd or lascivious conduct, as defined in [s]ection 288, with a child under the age of 14 all four crimes require that a defendant willfully and lewdly commit a lewd or lascivious act sexual desires of that person or the child. (see  288, subd. (a).) arancibia contends that the pattern instructions for these crimes are constitutionally infirm because, although [] the need for the touching 2 1111, 1112 and 1120 each define the requisite intent that must be present for a defendant to be convicted of the sexual offense: the intent of the defendant to sexually arouse himself or the child.3 in people v. martinez (1995) 11 cal.4th 434 (martinez), the physical 2 arancibia argument on the four pattern jury instructions does not challenge his conviction on count 11 for sexual penetration by a foreign object ( 289, subd. (i)). 3 the trial court gave calcrim no. 1110, the pattern instruction for section 288, subdivision (a) (lewd or lascivious act on child under 14 years), by stating as relevant: defendant willfully touched any part the clothing; [] 2. the defendant committed the act with the intent of arousing, appealing to, or gratifying the lust, passions, or sexual desires of himself or the child; [] and [] 3. the child was under the age of 14 years at the time of the act. [] someone commits an act willfully when he or she does it willingly or on purpose. it is not required that he or she intend to break the law, hurt someone else, or gain any advantage. [] actually arousing, appealing to, or gratifying the lust, passions, or sexual desires of the perpetrator or the child is not required. [] it is not a defense that the child may have calcrim no. 1111, the pattern instruction for section 288, subdivision (b)(1) (lewd or lascivious act by force on child under 14 years), calcrim no. 1112, the pattern instruction for section 288, subdivision (c)(1) (lewd or lascivious act on child 14 or 15 years old), and calcrim no. 1120, the pattern instruction for section 288.5, subdivision (a) (continuous sexual abuse of child under 14 years), all contain an intent provision like calcrim no. 1110, along with the specific elements for those crimes. 5 idibid.) d committed with idnot the nature of the offending act.
