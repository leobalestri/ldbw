(a)(1))1 and two counts of making criminal threats ( 422). the sentencing court sentenced defendant under the three strikes law to 25 years to life in prison, enhanced by 12 years due to the use of a deadly weapon and having suffered a prior serious felony, to run consecutively. the court also imposed a $7,200 restitution fine pursuant section 1202.4, subdivision (b)(1). in january 2019, defendant filed a filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in superior court, asking the court to vacate the $7,200 restitution fine. relying on the recently decided case of people v. dueas (2019) 30 cal.app.5th 1157, defendant claimed that the imposition of the restitution fine without a finding of his ability to pay was fundamentally unfair and unconstitutional. on february 26, 2019, the superior court denied the petition, on the grounds that it did not have jurisdiction to resentence defendant and if it did have jurisdiction, the petition would still be denied. the court found that at the time of sentencing defendant did not object to the imposition of the fine, or claim that he was unable to pay it, and that the sentencing court properly considered his future ability to pay. defendant filed a timely notice of appeal from the trial a certificate of probable cause, defendant stated that at the time of sentencing, he did not have a job, never had a bank account, . he added that at present, in prison, 1 all further statutory references are to the penal code, unless otherwise indicated. 3 he could not afford food or hygiene supplies. defendant also declared that although not reflected in the record, he objected to the fine at the time of sentencing, and the sentencing court did not hold a hearing on his ability to pay.2 after examination of the entire record, we are satisfied that responsibilities, and that no arguable issue exists. we conclude iance with the wende procedure and our review of the record, received adequate and effective appellate review of the judgment entered against him in this case. (smith v. robbins (2000) 528 u.s. 259, 278; people v. kelly (2006) 40 cal.4th 106, 123-124.) the order is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. ____________________________________________________________ ashmann-gerst, acting p. j., chavez, j., hoffstadt, j. 2 as the restitution fine imposed was greater than the minimum required by section 1202.4, subdivision (b)(1), defendant was entitled to object and demonstrate his inability to pay the fine. we have taken judicial notice of the opinion in the appeal taken from the 2002 judgment. (see people v. hobley (july 1, 2003, b160419) [nonpub opn.].) the record does not imposition of the fine or the alleged refusal by the trial court to hold a hearing on his ability to pay. he has thus failed to preserve a challenge to the restitution fine.
