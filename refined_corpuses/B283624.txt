(pen. code,  30305, subd. (a)(1).)1 the information further alleged that defendant was prohibited from owning and possessing a firearm pursuant to the penal code and sections 8100 and 8103 of the welfare and institutions code, having previously been convicted of a violation of health and safety code section 11352. on may 19, 2017, defendant filed a motion to suppress evidence ( 1538.5), specifically two bullets seized by law enforcement, from defendant at the time of his arrest. after a hearing, the trial court denied his motion. on july 6, 2017, in exchange for a promise of three years of formal felony probation and 365 days in jail with credit for time served, defendant pled no contest to the charge. the trial court suspended imposition of sentence and placed defendant on probation pursuant to the offer. he was awarded 156 days of custody credits. defendant appeals, challenging the denial of his motion to suppress. we affirm. factual background factual background defendant was stopped by two police officers after he was seen riding his bike on the wrong side of the road. the purpose of the stop was to give defendant a citation or warning. defendant stepped off his bike and placed it on the ground. los angeles police department officer ivan mcmillan told defendant why he was being detained. he asked for identification but defendant 1 all further statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise indicated. 3 did not have any. officer mcmillan then filled out a field identification card and checked for outstanding warrants over the air. defendant had no outstanding warrants. the officers gave defendant a verbal warning for riding his bicycle on the wrong side of the road. the traffic stop lasted about 40 to 50 seconds. officer mcmillan then asked defendant if he had any weapons or drugs on his person. it was standard procedure to ask anyone stopped in the skid row area that question. defendant replied that he did not. officer mcmillan then asked defendant if he could search his person. defendant gave the officers consent to search him. if defendant had denied consent [m]have let him go. officer johnson had defendant put his hands behind his head and patted him down. officer johnson felt ammunition were. defendant said that they were rifle rounds that he found in a trash can earlier that day. officer johnson removed two rifle defendant if he had been convicted of a felony. defendant had been convicted of 14 felonies and 23 misdemeanors. procedural background defendant filed a motion to suppress evidence. after entertaining oral argument, the trial court denied demotion, reasoning, in there was any constitutional violation under [section] 1538.5, the court believes that the defendant was riding on the wrong side of the road in a situation that made it dangerous and unlawful and in the area that we all know which is skid row and just a 4 dangerous area in and of itself. they have a right to stop him, to at least address the traffic violation, and they certainly can ask to search him. the officer said what would have happened if the defendant had declined, which he did not, and had the defendant [refused]ituation entirely, and that would be a cons discussion defendant argues that the trial court erred when it denied his motion to suppress the evidence. i. the law in reviewing the denial of a suppression motion pursuant to section 1538.5, the appellate court views the record in the light express or implied findings of fact that are supported by credibility issues, factual conflicts, and determination of the weight of the evidence. (people v. alvarez (1996) 14 cal.4th 155, 182; people v. leyba (1981) 29 cal.3d 591, 596597.) any ruling. (people v. trujillo (1990) 217 cal.app.3d 1219, 1224.) the reviewing court then exercises its independent judgment to determine whether, on the facts found, the seizure of defendant was unreasonable within the meaning of the united states constitution. (people v. glaser (1995) 11 cal.4th 354, 362; people v. williams (1988) 45 cal.3d 1268, 1301.) ii. analysis as the parties agree, defendant was detained during the traffic stop. sdetermination that defendant gave his consent to be searched after the traffic stop was completed. 5 officer mcmillan testifiidentification before the search. after asking for the identification, the officers completed a field identification card and checked for outstanding warrants. the officers then gave defendant a verbal warning. only after all of this did officer mcmillan ask for consent to search defendant, as part of standard procedure. on appeal, defendant argues that his consent was invalid because it was the result of an unduly prolonged stop; in other felt that he could leave or deny the to justify a search on the basis of consent, the state must the consent was in fact voluntarily given, and not the schneckloth v. bustamonte (1973) 412 u.s. 218, 248.) a voluntariness determination is a question of fact to be resolved by considering all attendant circumstances. (id. at pp. 248249.) thus, on if there is substantial evidence to support it. (people v. james (1977) 19 cal.3d 99, 107; people v. aguilar (1996) 48 cal.app.4th 632, 640.) ampinteraction occurred out in the public. there is no evidence that either officer had his weapon drawn. after the traffic stop was completed and the officers had given defendant a verbal warning, officer mcmillan asked defendant if he could be searched. while officer mcmillan did not tell defendant that he was free to leave, he was not required to advise defendant that he could refuse to consent. (ohio v. robinette (1996) 519 u.s. 33, 36 6 amendment [does not require] that a lawfully seized defendant [to] people v. galindo (1991) 229 cal.app.3d 1529, 15351536for permission to search carried with it the inference that consent could be withheld. (people v. bravo a person of normal intelligence is asked to give consent for a search he will infer that he has a right to withhold that defendant further argues that the search went beyond his consent because it violated the plain-touch rule under terry v. ohio (1968) 392 u.s. 1 (terry) and minnesota v. dickerson (1993) 508 u.s. 366. but a consent search does not need to be justified like a terry stop. (united states v. fuentes (9th cir. 1997) 105 f.3d 487, 489; people v. superior court (chapman) (2012) 204 cal.app.4t search, one waives the right [to be] protected by the fourth rather, once a defendant consents to a search, [w]hat would the typical reasonable person have understood by the exchange between the officer and florida v. jimeno (1991) 500 u.s. 248, 251252 (jimeno)of the consent is a question of fact to be determined from the totality of [the] cpeople v. crenshaw (1992) 9 cal.app.4th 1403, 1408.) unless clearly erroneous, the trial ibid.) 7 here, officer mcmillan asked defensearch his person for any weapons or narcotica police officer specifies the subject of a search, the scope of consent should be interpreted to include those areas where the officer might reasonably expect to find the items that are the subject of the search. (jimeno, supra, 500 u.s. at p. 251; people v. $48,715 united states currency (1997) 58 cal.app.4th 1507, reasonable person would have interpreted the scope of his consent to encompass a pat-down search and search of his pockets. search gave officer johnson an additional reason to believe that is consent. (united states v. gordon limit the scope of a general authorization to search, and failure to object when the search exceeds what he later claims was a more limited consent, is an indication the search was within the scope finally, defendant contends that the search was improper pocket was not immediately apparent. (see, e.g., in re lennies h. (2005) 126 cal.app.4th 1232, 1237.) the people respond that pocket were ammunition, and officer johnson was justified in regardless of whether bullets themselves are weapons, consent to be searched, the scope of the search properly included 8 bullets. after all, the bullets could not be used without a weapon and the officers did not know if defendant had a weapon nearby. in light of the circumstances of the traffic stop, namely defendant dangerously riding on the wrong side of the road in an area that is known to be dangerous, the officers rightly removed what they believed to be bullets, even before they knew that defendant was not allowed to possess them. disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. ________________________, j. ashmann-gerst we concur: _________________________, p. j. lui _________________________, j. chavez
