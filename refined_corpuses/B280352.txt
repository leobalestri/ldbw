evidence at trial in 2014 then-14-year-old jessica created a profile on an online dating website targeted to teenagers. jessica testified she entered her birthdate in creating her profile and the website automatically populated her age and updated it on her birthday. thus, her public profile showed her true age at all times. in july 2014 jessica received a message through the dating website from sanchez, whose profile said he was 18 years old. after approximately a week of exchanging messages on the website, the pair moved their conversations to a separate text-messaging service. over the next few months their conversations became more sexually explicit, including exchanging nude photographs and discussing sex acts they wanted to perform on one another. jessica testified that, in august or september 2014, sanchez told her he was actually 26 years old. in november or december 2014 jessica told her cousin about sanchez. specifically, jessica said she was dating an older man she had met online. however, jessica told her cousin sanchez was only 18 or 19 years old. a few weeks later, jessica became concerned her cousin had told relationship with sanchez. jessica and sanchez exchanged a statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise stated. 4 found out about their relationship. they both expressed anxiety about getting into trouble. sanchez repeatedly told jessica to delete all of their messages and to delete his phone number from her phone. sanchez and jessica first met in person in december 2014 when jessica was 15 years old and sanchez was 29 years old. they went to a movie, during which they kissed, sanchez touched he attempted to put his hand under her shirt. after the movie they went to the beach. while sitting on the beach, they kissed again. sanchez over her shirt and put his fingers in her vagina. he then performed oral sex on her, and she performed oral sex on him. sanchez next met jessica in person in early january 2015 when he picked her up at school. they went to a restaurant and then to a coffee shop, after which sanchez drove jessica back to school. jessica testified she performed oral sex on sanchez in the car while in the school parking lot. jessica testified her third meeting with sanchez was a few weeks later. jessica had herself dismissed from class by calling the school pretending to be her mother and saying she needed to leave school for the day. sanchez picked jessica up at school and drove her to his house where she performed oral sex on him. he then drove her back to school. fourth and final meeting with jessica occurred on february said jessica needed to be excused from school for the day. sanchez then picked jessica up from school and drove her to his house where they engaged in sexual intercourse and jessica performed oral 5 sex on sanchez. at some point in the afternoon jessica realized her family had discovered she was not at school and had been trying to reach her. she told sanchez to drive her to the mall. jessica testified that, during the car ride, sanchez told her she once at the mall, jessica called her parents and told them she had been at the mall all day. o interviewed jessica later the same day.3 in her first conversation with police, while her parents were present, jessica said sanchez was 28 years old and he knew she was 15 years old. she initially told police that day was the first time she met sanchez. she said he picked her up at school and they went to the mall and then to the beach. she denied any physical contact with sanchez. toward the end of the interview, the police asked if they could speak with jessica alone. out of the presence of her pshe had been to his house. she told them she had met sanchez twice but stated they had only kissed. the police examined sanchez. a few weeks later, during a follow-up interview, jessica told the police everything that had happened between her and sanchez. at trial jessica testified she had not told the truth 3 a recording of the february 13, 2015 interview with jessica and her parents was submitted into evidence, as was a transcript of the recording. the recording was played for the jury during trial. 6 so i felt l sanchez testified in his own defense. he admitted his profile on the dating website showed his age as 18 years old. he sanchez testified he told jessica he was 28 years old shortly after they began exchanging messages. during that conversation jessica admitted she was not 19 years old but said she was 18 years old. the next day, jessica said she was actually 17 years old, but was about to turn 18. sanchez testified jessica did not tell him she was 15 years old until she got in trouble with her parents on february 13, 2015. sanchez admitted meeting jessica in person only three first met in december 2014 when they went to see a movie. he said they kissed at the movie, but he denied touching thigh or trying to touch her breasts. he admitted they went to we started kissing, and some oral sex sanchez also admitted to meeting jessica a second time when he picked her up at school in early january 2015. he testified they went to the park and kissed, but he denied any oral sex took place in the car in the school parking lot. sanchez also when she said he took her to his house. he said that meeting did not take place. sanchez acknowledged he picked jessica up at school on february 13, 2015 after calling the school and pretending to be her father. he admitted taking jessica back to his house and having sex with her. 7 sanchez testified he had been in love with jessica and had considered her his girlfriend. 3. the verdict and sentence the jury found sanchez guilty on three counts of committing lewd conduct and not guilty on one count.4 the trial court sentenced sanchez to an aggregate state prison term of four years four months, consisting of the upper term of three years for the first count, plus consecutive eight-month terms (one-third the middle term) for each of the remaining counts. the court suspended the 16-month concluding portion of the sentence purportedly pursuant to section 1170, subdivision (h)(5). the court also ordered sanchez serve his sentence in county jail purportedly pursuant to section 1170, subdivision (h)(1) or (h)(2). discussion 1. the trial court did not err in failing to instruct the jury on mistake of fact a. governing law and standard of review a trial court in a criminal case has a duty to instruct on general principles of law applicable to the case (people v. blair (2005) 36 openly connected with the facts before the court, and which are people v. valdez (2004) 32 cal.4th 73, 115.) a court may, however, 4 the jury found sanchez guilty of committing lewd conduct in december 2014, early january 2015 and february 13, 2014. the jury found sanchez not guilty on the count alleging a second offense in mid-to-late january 2015. 8 incorrectly states the law, is argumentative, duplicative, or potentially confusing [citation], or if it is not supported by people v. burney (2009) 47 cal.4th 203, de novo. (people v. posey (2004) 32 cal.4th 193, 218.) b. gis not a defense to a violation of section 288, subdivision (c)(1) sanchez requested a jury instruction that a reasonable section 288, subdivision (c)(1). the trial court refused to give the instruction, relying on people v. paz (2000) 80 cal.app.4th 293 (paz) for the proposition mistake of age is not a defense to a violation of section 288, subdivision (c)(1). sanchez now argues the trial court erred in relying on paz because paz was wrongly decided.5 5 it is not entirely clear from the record that sanchez preserved this argument for appeal. before, during and after trial, the court engaged in extensive discussions with the parties regarding the availability of the mistake-of-age defense. initially, duriunderstand that mistake of age according to the case law is not mistake-of-fact defense,i respect the court needs to follow the law of paz only after the prosecution requested inclusion of a pinpoint jury instruction stating mistake of age is not a defense did mistake-of-age instruction, stating, footnote continued on the next page. 9 in paz a 28-year-old defendant was convicted of committing lewd acts on a 14-year-old victim in violation of section 288, subdivision (c)(1). the defendant argued the trial court should defense] . . . . , and it is the instruction. and if the court is inclined to do this, from my reading of paz, i went back last night and read it, actually, i think it indicates even in the use notes that mistake-of-fact is not a defense regarding someone under the age of 14, and not 14 to 15. . . . i am asking for the mistake-of-fact that she was not arguing mistake of fact, statingnly credibility . . . . likewise, at the conclusion of trial, defense mistake-of-fact] that the defense the defendant is deprived of that defense . . . discussions was not that sanchez was entitled to a mistake-of-fact instruction, but only that the prosecution was not entitled to a pinpoint instruction highlighting the unavailability of the mistake-of-fact defense. ultimately, the court included the pinpoint instruction requested by the prosecution and admonished the jury that to sanchez were to be considered for the limited purpose of assessing her credibility. on appeal sanchez has not challenged these actions. despite the equivocal objections by trial counsel and the incongruity of failing to appeal the inclusion of the pinpoint instruction and admonishment, we address the merits of 10 have instructed the jury on a mistake-of-fact defense. the fifth district rejgood faith mistake about the age of a 14- or 15-year-old victim is not a defense to a charge under penal code section 288, subdivision paz, supra, 80 cal.app.4th at p. 294.) the paz court began its analysis by discussing people v. olsen (1984) 36 cal.3d 638, in which the supreme court had held reasonable mistake of age is not a defense to a charge of committing lewd acts on a child under 14 years old (section 288, subdivision (a)). as paz explained, the olsen cpaz, supra, 80 cal.app.4th at p. 295; see olsenprotect children of tender years. . . . [s]ection 288 was enacted olsen was decided, section 288 prohibited acts of lewd conduct only on children under 14 years old. the provision prohibiting lewd conduct on 14- and 15-year-olds (what was initially enacted as subdivision (c) and would eventually become subdivision (c)(1)) was not added until 1989, more than four years after the olsen decision. (see paz, at p. 296, fn. 8.) the paz court was faced with the issue whether the policy articulated in olsen to preclude a mistake-of-age defense when the victim was under 14 years old should be extended to the prohibition against committing lewd conduct on a 14- or 15-year-old in light of the expanded scope of section 288. after conducting a detailed analysis of subdivision history, the fifth dof olsen for rejecting good faith mistake of age in section 288 cases involving victims under age 14 holds true for victims of 11 ages 14 anpaz, supra, 80 cal.app.4th at p. 298.) the paz court explained the legislation adding what is now subdivision (c)(1) felony laws, with respect to 14-and 15-year-olds, between felonious lewd conduct with a child under 14 ( 288, subd. (a)) and unlawful sexual intercourse with a child under 18 ( 261.5). charge applicable to lewd conduct on a child who had just turned 14 was a misdemeanor under section 647.6, although the same (paz, supra, 80 cal.app.4th at p. 296.) thus, nature of lewd acts on or with the child and, so long as no act of penetration occurred, the perpetrator would not face felony ibid.) based on this stated legislative purpose the paz court legislative desire to protect 14- and 15-year-olds from predatory older adults to the same extent children under 14 are protected by subdivision paz, supra, 80 cal.app.4th at p. 297.) allowing a mistake-of-age defense, the court concluded, id. at p. 295.) in other words, the enactment of subdivision (c) represented a desire to protect 14- and 15-year-old children more rigorously than older teenagers. thus, extension of the rationale in olsen to that group was fully consistent with the legislative intent. the paz court also found the absence of a consent element 12 paz, supra, 80 cal.app.4th at p. 297.) in fact, the inclusion of a consent element had been considered, and later abandoned, ibid.) the court reasoned the legislature had allowed for extenuating circumstances such as mistake of age or purported consent to be considered not as a defense, but instead as a sentencing factor. (id. at pp. 297-298 ubdivision (c)(1) permits the trial court to fashion a sentence consistent with the realities of the particular crime and discloses a legislative acknowledgement that some 14- and 15-year-olds may be more sexually sophisticated than others in those two age groups. this difference in the punishments indicates the legislature had no intention of permitting defenses based on the subdivision (c)(1) charge; if in a particular case there exist age, the statute allows for the consideration of that factor for ].) finally, the paz court observed olsen was decided prior to the enactment of subdivision (c) and the legislature is presumed to know of existing laws when it enacts new statutes. (paz, supra, 80 cal.app.4th at p. 298; see also people v. bonnetta (2009) 46 cal.4th 143, 150-151 legislative response to a judicial construction of a statute will not be deemed an implied ratification of that construction, when a statute has been construed by the courts and the legislature thereafter reenacts the statute without changing the interpreted language, a presumption is raised that the legislature was aware people v. blakeley (2000) 23 cal.4th 82, 89 [same].) in light of the l 13 intent to protect 14- and 15-year-olds and its presumed awareness of the holding in olsen, it is reasonable to infer, as the paz court did, that the legislature understood a mistake-of-age defense would not be permitted under the newly amended section 288, just as it had not been permitted under the prior version of section 288. sanchez cites no authority that has questioned or criticized the paz case in the 18 years since it was decided, nor have we found any. we agree with the analysis in paz that mistake of age is not a defense to violations of section 288, subdivision (c)(1). accordingly, the trial court did not err in refusing to give such an instruction to the jury. c. prohibition of the mistake-of-fact defense did not sanchez contends not allowing him to present a mistake-of-fact defense violated the federal and state cguarantee of equal protection of the law. specifically, sanchez argues defendants charged with violations of section 288, subdivision (c)(1), are prohibited from arguing their conduct is excused because they reasonably believed the victim was 18 years old, while defendants charged with violations of other statutes prohibiting sexual conduct with minors, such as section 261.5 (unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor), are entitled to a mistake-of-age defense. sanchez claims he is similarly situated to defendants charged with violating these other statutes prohibiting sexual conduct with minors and their differential treatment has no rational basis. to prevail on an equal protection challenge, a party must affects two or more similarly situated groups in an unequal 14 cooley v. superior court (2002) ask at the threshold whether two classes that are different in some respects are sufficiently similar with respect to the laws in question to require the government to justify its differential treatment of these people v. mckee (2010) 47 cal.4th 1172, 1202.) the contention defendants charged with violations of section 288, subdivision (c)(1), are similarly situated to defendants charged with violations of section 261.5 was rejected in people v. cavallaro (2009) 178 cal.app.4th 103, which denied an equal protection challenge to mandatory sex offender registration for persons convicted of violating section 288, subdivision (c)(1).6 the defendant had claimed, because individuals convicted of violating section 261.5 were not required to register, the registration requirement was invalid as applied to defendants convicted of violating section 288, subdivision (c)(1). (cavallaro, at p. 111.) the court held individuals convicted under the two statutes were not similarly situated. (id. at pp. 113-114.) first, section 288, subdivision (c)(1), includes a specific intent element that is not present in section 261.5: state required for a conviction under section 288 is a distinction that is meaningful in deciding whether a person convicted under that statute is similarly situated with one convicted under 6 sanchez did not address cavallaro in his opening brief and failed to file a reply brief responding to the discussion of the case by the attorney general. 15 section (cavallaro, at p. 114.) second, because section 288, subdivision (c)(1), requires the defendant be at least 10 properly concluded that it was necessary to specifically prohibit sexual conduct between a 14 or 15 year old and an adult at least 10 years older . . . because of the potential for predatory behavior resulting from the significant age difference between the adult (cavallaro, at p. 114.) finally, section 288, subdivision (c)(1), exclusively protects a subset of the children protected by section 261.5 (that is, 14- or 15-year-olds, versus all children under 18 years old), reflecting a legislative intent to protect sexually nave children from considerably older adults. (cavallaro, at pp. 114-115.) we agree with cavallaroconclusion that persons convicted under sections 288, subdivision (c)(1), and 261.5 are not similarly situated for purposes trial or punishment.7 constitutional rights were not violated by the lack of a defense based on his alleged reasonable, good faith mistake of fact as to age. 7 the same is true of the other statutes sanchez cites in his equal protection argument. sections 286 (sodomy with a minor) and 288a (oral copulation with a minor) do not contain a specific intent element and do not limit their protections to children age 14 and 15 years old. likewise, section 647.6 (molesting a child) does not contain a specific intent element, does not contain an age differential element, and does not limit its protections to children age 14 or 15 years old. 16 2. counsel was not ineffective in failing to a. governing law the right to counsel guaranteed by both the sixth amendment to the united states constitution and article i, section 15 of the california constitution includes, and indeed presumes, the right to effective counsel . . . . (people v. blair, supra, 36 cal.4th at p. 732.) to establish ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant must show that (1) counsels representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness under prevailing professional norms, and (2) counsels deficient performance was prejudicial, i.e., there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsels failings, the result would have been more favorable to the defendant. (people v. johnson (2015) 60 cal.4th 966, 979-980; accord, in re crew (2011) 52 cal.4th 126, 150; see strickland v. washington (1984) 466 u.s. 668, 694 [104 s.ct. 2052, 80 l.ed.2d 674].) the burden of sustaining a charge of inadequate or ineffective representation is upon the defendant. the proof . . . must be a demonstrable reality and not a speculative matter. (people v. karis (1988) 46 cal.3d 612, 656; accord, people v. vines (2011) 51 cal.4th 830, 875.) there is a presumption the challenged action or inaction might be considered sound trial strategy under the circumstances. (strickland v. washington, supra, 466 u.s. at p. 689; accord, people v. gamache (2010) 48 cal.4th 347, 391; people v. carter (2003) 30 cal.4th 1166, 1211.) moreover, [i]n reviewing a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, we give great deference to counsels tactical decisions. (people v. johnson, supra, 60 cal.4th at p. 980.) 17 b. was deficient sanchez argues his cbecause she failed to object to certain statements made by the prosecutor to the jury. during his closing argument the prosecutor stated, in regard to the second meeting between now, both the defendant and the victim testified regarding the date where they went to [a restaurant] and the park. and in that the only real disparity is that the defendant denies any oral sex occurred in the car and the victim said they did engage in oral sex in the car. but i would submit to you that whether they did or did not commit oral sex, there were own account. they held hands, they kissed. all of these touchings. all of these are clearly motivated by the same interest statements were legally incorrect. to be sure, sanchez is correct a kiss or a touch is not necessarily sexual in nature. however, it may be. as this court has obseras a big-city orchestra. it can be a perfunctory peck on the cheek, as close to intercourse as you can get.in re r.c. (2011) 196 cal.app.4th 741, 751, quoting bechtel, the practical encyclopedia of sex and health (1993) pp. 182-183; see also people v. martinez for almost a century, section 288 has been interpreted to require no particular form of physical contact. the courts have established in a long unbroken line of cases that the crime occurs whenever the trier of 18 fact determines, based on all the circumstances, that an underage child was touched with the requisite sexual intent. a construction permitting conviction for any and all sexually motivated contact is supported by the relevant statutory language and surrounding scheme, and apparently has been accepted by the legislature. the prosecutor here correctly stated to the jury that a kiss or touch may be sufficient to constitute a lewd act under section 288, subdivision (c)(1), if performed with the requisite intent. in addition, the jury was properly instructed by the court on the elements of the charges, including the intent element. assistance of counsel. (see people v. centeno (2014) 60 cal.4th 659, 675 [[t]he decision facing counsel in the midst of trial over whether to object to comments made by the prosecutor in closing argument is a highly tactical one [citation], and a mere failure to object to evidence or argument seldom establishes counsels incompetence; people v. mcdermott (2002) 28 cal.4th 946, 992 ecause a motion or objection on the ground now asserted by defendant would have been futile, trial counsels failure . . . to object to the prosecutors argument was not deficient performancepeople v. thompson (2010) 49 cal.4th 79, 3. sentencing errors require a remand for resentencing the trial courtsentence pursuant to section 1170, subdivision (h)(5), and the order the sentence be served in county jail pursuant to section 1170, subdivision (h)(1) and (h)(2), were improper and 19 resulted in an unauthorized sentence.
