(see people v. sherow (2015) 239 cal.app.4th 875, 878 (sherowpeople v. rizo (2000) oter initiative like [proposition 47], [the courts] kavanaugh v. west sonoma county union high school dist. (2003) 29 is subject to de 2 4 2. proposition 47 in november 2014, california voters enacted proposition 47, making certain drug and theft-related offenses misdemeanors, unless the defendants were otherwise ineligible. ( 1170.18, subds. (a)-hese offenses had previously been designated as either felonies or wobblers (crimes that can be punished as either felonies or people v. rivera (2015) 233 cal.app.4th 1085, 1091.) the statute also contains a resentencing provision, where sentence for an offense that is now a misdemeanor under proposition 47, may petition for a recall of that sentence and request resentencing in accordance with the statutes that were added or amended by proposition idthe statutory criteria [in section 1170.18] shall have his or her sentence recalled and be resentenced to a misdemeanor . . . unless the court, in its discretion, determines that resentencing the petitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. people v. lynall (2015) 233 cal.app.4th 1102, 1109.) here, hill was convicted of receiving stolen property in violation of section 496 which, as amended by proposition 47, now property does not exceed nine hundred fifty dollars ($950), the offense shall be a 496, subd. (a); see also people v. shabazz (2015) 237 cal.app.4th 303, 308.) absent other disqualifying circumstances, hill would be eligible for resentencing if the value of the stolen property did not exceed $950. 3. hill failed to show she was eligible for resentencing hill contends that she was entitled to a presumption of eligibility for resentencing under proposition 47. that is, she argues that the court should have presumed the value of the stolen property did not exceed $950 and that she was therefore eligible for relief. we disagree. in fact, ed under [i]t is a rational allocation of burdens if the petitioner in such cases bear the burden of showing that he or she is sherow, supra, 239 cal.app.4th at p. 878.) 5 certainly, we acknowledge that section 1170.18 is silent as to which party has the burden of establishing eligibility for resentencing. however, it is well-established that a party seeking relief typically carries the burden of proof as to each fact necessary to her claim for relief, unless a different burden is specifically assigned by law. (evid. code,  500; see also vance v. bizek (2014) 228 cal.app.4th 1155, 1163.) this who seeks - want[s] the court to do something . . . [must] present evidence sufficient to overcome the state of affairs that would exist if the court did nothing. vance, supra, 228 cal.app.4th at p. 1163.) appellate courts are in agreement that a defendant seeking resentencing under proposition 47 has the burden of showing eligibility. (see perkins, supra, 244 cal.app.4th at p. 136 relief, and because proposition 47 does not provide otherwise, a petitioner for resentencing under proposition 47 must establish his or her eligibility for such resentencing sherow, supra, 239 cal.app.4th at pp. 878-879; people v. rivas-colon (2015) 241 cal.app.4th 444, 449-450 (rivas-colon).) placing the burden on the petitioner to provide evidence showing eligibility is decision on a section 1170.18 petition is inherently factual, requiring the trial court to determine (people v. contreras (2015) 237 cal.app.4th 868, 892), nothing in the plain language of the statute requires a trial court to hold a hearing in order to do so. ( 1170.18, subd. (a); see also rivas-colon, supra, 241 cal.app.4th at p. 452, fn. 4 [courts should interpret section 1170.18 similarly to section 1170.126]; people v. bradford (2014) 227 cal.app.4th 1322, 1337 [in interpreting section ting a prima facie case for resentencing, supported by evidence, the trial court could 6 summarily grant the petition if the prosecution poses no opposition, or hold a hearing to address the issues in dispute. (see perkins, supra, 244 cal.app.4th at p. 138.) therefore, a defendant seeking resentencing must provide evidence sufficient to show eligibility in order to avoid a trial court summarily denying the petition. (see perkins, supra, 244 cal.app.4th at p. 137 ns can be resolved based 37 (couzens & bigelow), at <http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/prop-47-information.pdf> [as of feb. 5, 2016] [trial courts may summarily deny facially deficient petitions].) the misdemeanor . . . had [section 1170.18, subd. (a).) to be convicted of a misdemeanor under section 496, the value of the stolen . . . must set out a case for eligibility, stating and in some cases showing . . . the value of the property did not perkins, supra, 244 cal.app.4th at pp. 136-137id. at p. 137.) here, hill did not allege any value concerning the stolen property. by failing to set forth a value, or even to allege the value did not exceed $950, hill did not state a prima facie case showing eligibility. because hill failed to satisfy her burden of proving she was eligible for resentencing, the trial court did not err in denying her petition. (see id. at p. 138 hold only that the statute required defendant to include information supporting his petition with his initial filing. since he did not do so, we cannot conclude the superior since we conclude hill failed to satisfy her initial burden of showing eligibility for resentencing, we need not reach the issue of whether the court erroneously relied on evidence outside the record of conviction. it is a well-review that a correct decision of the trial court must be affirmed on appeal even if it is green v. superior court (1985) 40 cal.3d 126, 138; 7 see also people v. dawkins right upon any theory of the law applicable to the case, [a decision] must be sustained regardless of the put another way, since hill did not provide any evidence in her initial petition as to the value of the stolen property, her petition was correctly denied even if the court should not have relied on the probation report to determine the value of the stolen property. (see rivas-colon, supra, 241 he did not satisfy his burden], we need not consider rivas-.) 4. hill failed to show that trial counsel was ineffective hill also contends that defense counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the probation report in denying her proposition 47 petition. we disagree. resentencing, we need not reach this issue. second, ineffective assistance of counsel claim fails because the record does not reveal counsel's reason for failing to argue that the stolen property did not exceed $950, or that the court should not rely on the probation report to determine the value of the property. (people v. vines (2011) 51 cal.4th 830, 876 [rejecting ineffective assistance of counsel claim where record did not establish why defense counsel failed to introduce impeachment evidence].) in fact, given that the probation report established the value of the stolen property was $5,000, defense counsel, an officer of the court, would have mislead the court if counsel had argued that the value of the stolen property was less than $950. (cal. rules of professional conduct, rule 5-200(a), (b).) an attorney may choose not to object for many reasons, and the failure to object rarely establishes ineffectiveness of counsel. (people v. kelly (1992) 1 cal.4th 495, 540.) 8 disposition hill is not precluded from filing a new petition in accordance with the views set forth in this opinion.
