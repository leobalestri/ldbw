(a); count 9) and robbery ( 211; count 6). on july 19, 1996, he was convicted of attempted murder ( 664/187, subd. (a); count 3) and assault with a firearm ( 245, subd. (a)(2); count 4).3 in an unpublished opinion in b104813, this court affirmed the judgment of conviction and ordered certain modifications to the sentence. on january 26, 2015, defendant filed a petition for the recall of his felony sentence on his conviction for receiving stolen property4 and to be resentenced to a misdemeanor pursuant to section 1170.18.5 he denied having any convictions for offenses listed in section 667, subdivision (e)(2)(c)(iv) or that would require him to register pursuant to section 290, subdivision (c). the people filed a response opposing the petition, contending defendant was ineligible for the requested relief, because of his attempted 3 the remaining counts were dismissed or not prosecuted. 4 this petition was signed by defendant on january 21, 2015. on the same date, he signed a separate petition seeking proposition 47 relief with respect to his robbery conviction. this petition apparently was not filed. in a third petition filed february 26, 2015, which defendant signed but did not date, he sought relief with regard to his attempted murder, assault with a deadly weapon, robbery, and receiving stolen property convictions. on appeal, defendant challenges the denial of his petition solely with respect to his receiving stolen property conviction. we therefore deem defendant to have abandoned any claims of error regarding his other three convictions in that case. 5 the petition was alternatively designated as an application for his felony conviction to be designated a misdemeanor conviction pursuant to section 1170.18. the application procedure applies only to a defendant who completed his or her sentence for the conviction at issue. we invited the parties to address whether defendant received a misdemeanor sentence for receiving stolen property and if he has completed his sentence, and have received their responses. we augment the record with the certified copy of the docket submitted by defendant and deny as moot his request for judicial notice thereof. the record now reveals defendant received a felony sentence for the receiving stolen property conviction and he has not completed that sentence. 4 murder conviction. at the hearing, the people pointed out in addition to attempted murder, defendant also was convicted of robbery and assault with a deadly weapon. the court denied the petition for the reason defen sentence for a conviction . . . who would have been guilty of a misdemeanor under [proposition 47] had [proposition 47] been in effect at the time of the offense may petition for a recall of sentence . . . to request resentencing in accordance with . . . section . . . 496 . . . of the penal code, as [this section hadproposition 47.6 ( pursuant to . . . section . . . 496 . . . of the penal code, [as this section had] been amended or added by [proposition 47], unless the court, in its discretion, determines that ( 1170.18, subd.

(b).) disposition the order appealed from is conditionally reversed. the matter is remanded for further proceedings consistent with the views expressed in this opinion. the order is affirmed should the trial court determine resentencing would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. the order is reversed if the trial court determines this is not the 7 case, and the trial court shall grant the petition, recall the felony sentence for receiving stolen property, and resentence as a misdemeanor. not to be published in the official reports. boren, p.j. we concur: ashmann-gerst, j. hoffstadt, j.
