(c)) (count 3), both felonies. defendant received a nine-year sentence. we reverse the section 654, subdivision (a) stay on count three with directions, upon remittitur issuance, to first impose a sentence and then stay it. we modify the judgment with respect to court facilities and operations assessments. we affirm the judgment in all other respects. ii. discussion a. sufficiency of the evidence of force defendant argues there was insufficient evidence of force. we apply the evidence of force necessary to affirm his conviction of forcible rape, we must determine only whether, on the record as a whole, any rational trier of fact could find him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. [citation.] we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, and presume in support of the judgment the existence of every fact the trier could reasonably deduce from the evidepeople v. griffin (2004) 33 cal.4th 1015, 1028; accord, people v. hale (2012) 204 cal.app.4th 961, 976 [forcible sodomy]; in re jose p. (2005) 131 cal.app.4th 110, 115 [forcible rape].) we find substantial evidence supported defendant rape is an act of sexual intercourse accomplished with a person not the spouse of the perpetrator, under any of the following circumstances: [] . . ll by means of force, 1 further references are to the penal code except where otherwise noted. 3 violence, duress, menace or fear of immediate and unlawful bodily injury on the person there is substantial evidence the act was accomplished by force, violence, duress, menace, or fear of bodily harm.

(b)].) moreover, the necessary force need not be substantially different or greater than the physical force inherent in a consensual act of sexual intercourse. (people v. griffin, supra, 33 cal.4th at pp. 1023-1024; people v. mejia, supra, 155 cal.app.4th at p. 99; in re jose p., supra, 131 cal.app.4th at p. 115.) the kind or degree of force used is 4 immaterial. (people v. griffin, supra, 33 cal.4th at pp. 1024-1025; people v. mejia, supra, 155 cal.app.4th at p. 100.) as our supreme court held in griffin, in order to prove force within the meaning of section 261, subdivision (a)(2): need only show the defendant used physical force of a degree sufficient to support a people v. young[, supra,] 190 cal.app.3d [at pp.] 257-people v. griffin, supra, 33 cal.4th at pp. 1023-1024; accord, people v. mejia, supra, 155 cal.app.4th at pp. 99-100.) in griffin, supra, 33 cal.4th at pages 1027-1028, our supreme court concluded: rape is a sexual penetration accomplished against by means of force, violence, duress, menace, or fear of immediate and unlawful bodily injury. . . . [i]n a forcible rape prosecution the jury determines whether the use of force served to overcome the will of the victim to thwart or resist the attack, not whether the use of such force physically facilitated sexual penetration or prevented the victim from physically resisting her attacker. . . . [] the question for the jury in this case was simply whether the defendant used force to accomplish intercourse with [the strength or ability to resist him. cumstances of the case, including the presence of verbal or nonverbal threats, or the kind of force that might reasonably induce fear in the mind of the victim, to ascertain sufficiency of the evidence of a conviction [of forcible rape]. talics added; accord, people v. lee (2011) 51 cal.4th 620, 641, fn. 15; people v. mejia, supra, 155 cal.app.4th at pp. 99-100; in re jose p., supra, 131 cal.app.4th at pp. 115-116; cf. people v. hale, supra, 204 cal.app.4th at p. 979 [ 286, subd. (c)(2)]; in re asencio (2008) 166 cal.app.4th 1195, 1200-1206 [ 289, subd. (a)(1)].) the evidence as a whole, viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict, was n. defendant was a big, strong and muscular man. the victim was his 17-year-old niece. theirs had been a close relationship over a 10-year period. the victim looked up to her uncle. she loved and fully trusted him. she considered him a mentor. on the night in question, defendant 5 hugged the victim and did not let her go when she tried to move away. he stroked her breast and then her hip bone. he pulled up her t-shirt and licked her nipple. he licked was] but her two young brothers were nearby. defendant pulled down her shorts and her underwear. the victim squirmed. defendant moved quickly. he used his hands to roll her over onto her side, physically moving her into a position that facilitated the rape. he inserted his penis into her vagina from behind. then he removed his penis and got on his knees. he attempted to roll the victim over onto her knees buguest bedroom where her brothers were sleeping, locked herself in and called for help. she was crying hysterically. during the assault, thin her words. she thought about whether defendant would try to kill her. she did not want to do anything to alert her young brothers that anything was wrong. this was substantial evidence of force within the meaning of section 261, subdivision (a)(2). (see people v. hale, supra, 204 cal.app.4th at p. 979; in re asencio, supra, 166 cal.app.4th at pp. 1205-1206; people v. mejia, supra, 155 cal.app.4th at pp. 100-102; in re jose p., supra, 131 cal.app.4th at pp. 116-118.) b. sentencing 1. section 654, subdivision (a) the trial court stayed the sentence on count 3, unlawful sexual intercourse with a count 3, o strike the punishment on that first select one of the three determinate terms ( 1170, subd.
