(pen. code,1  1170.126.) appellant contends the trial court erred in determining that appellant was ineligible for recall and finding that appellant was armed during the commission of the crime of possession of a firearm by a felon.2 we disagree and resentence him as a second strike offender. factual and procedural background bell gardens police officers responding to a call observed appellant duck behind a parked car and toss a loaded .38-caliber handgun about 10 feet away. a jury convicted appellant of being a convicted felon in possession of a firearm. ( 12021, subd. (a)(1).) the trial court found that appellant had suffered two ( 667, subds. (b)(i), 1170.12, subds.

(e)(2).) discussion appellant is ineligible for resentencing because he was armed during the commission of the offense of possession of a firearm by a felon a. the three strikes reform act of 2012 on november 6, 2012, california voters passed proposition 36, the three strikes reform act of 2012 (the act), which amended the three strikes law with respect to defendants whose current conviction (the offense for which the third-strike sentence was imposed) is for a felony that is neither serious nor violent. (people v. johnson (2015) 61 cal.4th 674, 679, 681 (johnson); people v. burnes (2015) 242 cal.app.4th 1452, 14571458; people v. yearwood (2013) 213 cal.app.4th 161, 167168.) the act amended sections 667 and 1170.12, and added section 1170.126, subdivision (b), authorizing a prisoner serving a third-strike indeterminate life sentence to petition the trial court for recall of the sentence and for resentencing as a second-strike offender. (johnson, at pp. 679680.) not every third-strike offender whose current offense is neither serious nor violent qualifies for resentencing under the act, however. the act disqualifies any inmate whose current offense was any of several specified crimes, with a firearm or deadly weapon. ( 667, subd. (e)(2)(c)(iii), 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(c)(iii) (hereinafter subdivision (iii)); johnson, supra, 61 cal.4th at p. 682; people v. osuna (2014) 225 4 cal.app.4th 1020, 10281029 (osuna); people v. brimmer (2014) 230 cal.app.4th 782, 791793 (brimmer).) b. during the commission of the offense and is therefore ineligible for relief under the act appellant contends that according to the plain language of the act, the ineligibility factors listed in subdivision (iii) must be construed as in addition to, and not simply coextensive with, the elements of the current offense. he asserts that both the statutory construction and a grammatical analysis of the statute support this interpretation, and maintains that because the act does not disqualify inmates serving sentences for mere gun former penal code section [120214] he further contends that the reference during the commission of the current offense another offense to tethered, must h facilitative nexus he concludes that an interpretation of the statute that allows a person to be considered armed with a firearm while committing the crime of possession of the same firearm would render the during the commission language meaningless. we disagree. the implicit assumption that the crime of possession of a firearm always involves arming. not so. while being armed with a firearm invariably involves possession, the reverse is not always true. 4 appellant refers to section 12021.1; however, he was charged and convicted under section 12021, subdivision (a)(1). 5 convicted of a felony to own or have in his or her possession or under his or her custody or control, any firearm. the elements of this offense are conviction of a felony and ownership or knowing people v. blakely (2014) 225 cal.app.4th 1042, 1052 (blakely); osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1029; people v. snyder (1982) 32 cal.3d 590, possesses a weapon when it is under his dominion and control.

(e.g.,  1203.06, subd. (b)(3); health & saf. code,  11370.1, subd.

(blakely, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1052; people v. elder (2014) 227 cal.app.4th 1308, 1313 (elder); people v. white (2014) 223 cal.app.4th 512, 524 (white).) context of section 12022,5 appellant asserts that bland that arming is found if the weapon is available for use at any during (see bland, supra, 10 cal.4th at pp. 999, 10011003; see also osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1031.) thus, according to appellant, the definition of arming includes an underlying offense beyond the substantive offense of possession alone. as other courts have observed in responding to the same concerned with imposing an arming enhancementan additional term of imprisonment added to the base term, for which a defendant cannot be punished until and unless convicted of a people v. hicks (2014) 231 cal.app.4th 275, 283 (hicks); osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. on its conflating the criterial definition of an ineligible offense (being armed during the commission of such offense) with the derivative nature of the armed enhancement (which requires being armed in 5 section 12022 provides for the imposition of an additional in the commission offense. (bland, supra, 10 cal.4th at p. 995.) 7 elder, supra, 227 cal.app.4th at p. 1313; see also osuna, at pp. 10311032.) appellant criticizes osuna and cases following it for during the in the commission of a bland in the context of section 12022. as osuna explained: internat. dict.

([subdivision (iii)]), and since at issue is not the imposition of additional punishment but rather eligibility for reduced punishment, we conclude the literal language of the act disqualifies an inmate from resentencing if he or she was armed (osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1032; elder, supra, 227 cal.app.4th at pp. 13121313; hicks, supra, 231 cal.app.4th at p. 284; brimmer, supra, 230 cal.app.4th at p. 799.) in the present case, police officers observed appellant toss a loaded firearm and saw it land about 10 feet away. appellant was thus in actual, not constructive, possession of a firearm. ineligible for relief under the act. (bland, supra, 10 cal.4th at pp. 999, 10011003; see also osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1031.) appellant acknowledges that appellate courts have consistently rejected his argument that the factors listed in subdivision (iii) must be tethered to another offense, and one the same weapon. he contends, however, that these cases were meaning of subdivision (iii) requires both that the firearm be available and have a facilitative nexus to the crime upon which the defendant has been sentenced. we join the consensus among california courts in holding that the ineligibility factor of being 9 armed with a firearm during the commission of the current offense applies whenever the record shows the defendant was in actual physical possession of the firearm, and therefore decline -appellant further argues that it is inconsistent with the purpose of the act to construe subdivision (iii) to deny relief to anyone who had access to a weapon during the commission of a nonviolent crime without requiring that such access be for the purpose of voter initiative like [the act], we apply the same principles that people v. rizo (2000) construction is to ascertain the intent of the lawmakers so as to language of the statute, to which we give its ordinary meaning and construe in the context of the statutory scheme. if the language is ambiguous, we look to other indicia of voter intent.(johnson, supra, 61 cal.4th at p. 682; blakely, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1053.) as set forth above, we find that the act explicitly disqualifies any inmate from resentencing who was armed with a firearm during the unlawful possession of that firearm. (osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1032.) moreover, our reading of the the intent underlying the -risk, nonviolent inmates serving life sentences for petty crimes, such as shoplifting and simple drug possession. (voter information guide, [gen. elec. (nov. 6, 2012)] text of prop. 36,  1, subds. (3), white, supraot to throw open the prison 10 doors to all third strike offenders whose current convictions were not for serious or violent felonies, but only to those who were perceived as nondangerous or posing little or no risk to the public. a felon who has been convicted of two or more serious and/or violent felonies in the past, and most recently had a firearm readily available for use, simply does not pose little or no risk to osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1038.) as our supreme court has recogni (bland, supra, 10 cal.4th at p. 997; brimmer, supra, 230 cal.app.4th at p. 799.) in light of the fact that appellant was armed with a firearm during the commission of his offense, he does not fall into the category of a low-risk, nonviolent offender, and his crime cannot be deemed a petty or minor crime for purposes of resentencing under the act. for these reasons, we reach the same conclusion as all the published decisions to consider the issue: a defendant is ineligible for resentencing under proposition 36 if he was armed at the time he committed the felony of illegal possession of a firearm. (see hicks, supra, 231 cal.app.4th 275; brimmer, supra, 230 cal.app.4th 782; elder, supra, 227 cal.app.4th 1308; osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th 1020; blakely, supra, 225 cal.app.4th 1042; white, supra, 223 cal.app.4th 512.) accordingly, the trial court properly determined that appellant is ineligible for recall and resentencing under proposition 36. 11 disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published. lui, j. we concur: chaney, acting p. j. johnson, j.
