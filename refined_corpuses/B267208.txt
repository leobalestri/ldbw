(people v. fairbank (1997) 16 cal.4th 1223, 1254.) ion to withdraw a guilty plea rests in the sound discretion of the trial court and is final unless the defendant can show a clear abuse of that discretion. [citation.] moreover, a reviewing cs factual findings if substantial evidence supports them. [citation.] [citation;] accord, people v. breslin (2012) 205 cal.app.4th 1409, 1416 [140 cal.rptr.3d 906].) guilty pleas resulting from a bargain should not be set aside lightly and finality of pr (people v. weaver (2004) 118 cal.app.4th 131, 146 [12 cal.rptr.3d 742].) [t]he fact s ruling on a section 1018 motion is reviewed by us under the standard appropriately results in our paying considerable deference to the all questions of the weight and sufficiency of the evidence are addressed, in the first instance, to the trier of fact, in this case, the trial (people v. nance (1991) 1 cal.app.4th 1453, 1460, fn. 4 [2 cal.rptr.2d 670].)(people v. archer (2014) 230 cal.app.4th 693, 702.) the defendant has the burden to establish good cause for the withdrawal of his plea by clear and convincing evidence. (people v. cruz (1974) 12 cal.3d 562, 566; people v. breslin, supra, at p. 1416.)1 good cause is not established because a defendant has changed his mind about the wisdom of the plea, however. (people v. nance, supra, 1 cal.app.4th at p. 1457.) 1 the defendant must also show prejudice in that he or she would not have accepted the plea had the complained of circumstances not existed. (people v. breslin, supra, 205 cal.app.4th at p. 1416.) upport of the motion asserts prejudice, but in light of the finding of no good cause, we need not reach that issue on appeal. 4 in this case, gonzalez asserts that he was coerced into entering his plea because he would have been remanded had he not done so. the facts, found by the trial court and amply supported by the record, are to the contrary. while the court did indicate that remand was likely, the court had also reset bail prior to gonzalez appearance. counsel did not request that that bail amount be lowered, or that defendant be released without bail. in entering the plea, gonzalez affirmed that neither threats nor promises had been made to him to induce his action. in light of those facts, we find no abuse of discretion in the denial of the motion. disposition the order denying the motion is affirmed. zelon, acting p. j. we concern: segal, j. garnett, j. judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
