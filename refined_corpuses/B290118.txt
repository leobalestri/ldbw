(a),2 counts 1 and 2), assault with a semiautomatic firearm ( 245, subd. (b), counts 3 and 4), discharging a firearm with gross negligence ( 246.3, subd. (a), count 5) and reckless evading (veh. code,  2800.2, count 6). the information also alleged that jones personally used and 2 all further undesignated statutory references are to the penal code. 4 discharged a firearm ( 12022.53, subds. (b), (c), counts 1 and 2;  12022.5, subd. (a), counts 1 through 4); and had suffered a prior conviction for robbery, a serious or violent felony ( 667, subds. (a)(1), (b) (i), 1170.12). on march 14, 2018, pursuant to a negotiated disposition, jones pled no contest to counts 3 and 4, assault with a semiautomatic firearm, and admitted personally using a firearm within the meaning of section 12022.5, subdivision (a), during commission of the offenses. prior to entering his plea, jones was advised of, and waived, his rights to a jury trial; to confront and cross-examine witnesses; to subpoena witnesses and present a defense; and against self-incrimination. he was also advised of the charges against him, the potential maximum sentence, and the possible consequences of a no contest or guilty plea, including the potential immigration consequences. the trial court found there was a factual basis for joness plea, and sentenced him to the agreed-upon term of 16 years in prison, configured as follows: on count 3, the base count, the midterm of six years, plus a consecutive 10-year term for the firearm enhancement, along with an identical, concurrent term on count 4. the trial court dismissed the remaining counts and allegations. it imposed a restitution fine, a suspended parole revocation restitution fine, a court security fee, and a criminal conviction assessment. it awarded jones 185 days of actual custody credit and 27 days of conduct credit, for a total of 212 days. ( 2933.1, 667.5, subd. (c)(8).) on april 6, 2018, jones, acting in propria persona, filed a handwritten document seeking to withdraw his no contest pleas, claiming he pled because he was under duress, had received deceptive advice, and his counsel provided ineffective 5 assistance. on april 9, 2018, the trial court ordered the purported motion lodged but not filed, because (1) it had not been served upon the people, (2) it failed to comply with the rules of court, and (3) its allegations were conclusionary and unsworn. accordingly, the court found the motion was ineffective and of no legal consequence, and concluded no hearing was required. on may 10, 2018, jones filed a timely notice of appeal, stating that his appeal was based on the sentence or other matters occurring after th validity. jones did not obtain a certificate of probable cause. discussion after review of the record, joness court-appointed counsel filed an opening brief that raised no issues, and requested this court to conduct an independent review of the record pursuant to people v. wende (1979) 25 cal.3d 436. we advised appellant that he had 30 days to submit by brief or letter any contentions or argument he wished this court to consider. we have received no response. pursuant to section 1237.5 and california rules of court, rule 8.304(b), a criminal defendant who appeals following a plea of no contest or guilty, without a certificate of probable cause, may only challenge the denial of a motion to suppress evidence or raise grounds arising after the entry of the plea that do not affect the pleas validity. (people v. johnson (2009) 47 cal.4th 668, 676677; people v. french (2008) 43 cal.4th 36, 43.) in particular, a defendant must obtain a certificate of probable cause in order to appeal from the denial of a motion to withdraw a plea. (people v. johnson, certificate of probable cause in order to appeal from the denial of a motion to withdraw a guilty plea, even though such a motion 6 involves a proceeding that occurs after ]; in re chavez (2003) 30 cal.4th 643, 651.) a certificate of probable cause is likewise required when a defendant claims that a plea was induced by misrepresentations of a fundamental nature (people v. panizzon (1996) 13 cal.4th 68, 76), or that he or she received ineffective assistance of counsel prior to the plea (people v. mcewan (2007) 147 cal.app.4th 173, 178; people v. stubbs (1998) 61 cal.app.4th 243, 244245). with respect to sentencing or post-plea issues that do not in substance challenge the validity of the plea itself, we have examined the record and are satisfied no arguable issues exist and joness attorney has fully complied with the responsibilities of counsel. (people v. kelly (2006) 40 cal.4th 106, 126; people v. wende, supra, 25 cal.3d at pp. 441442.) 7 disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports edmon, p. j. we concur: egerton, j. dhanidina, j.
