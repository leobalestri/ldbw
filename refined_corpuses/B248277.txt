(pen. code,  1170.126).1 his appointed counsel filed a wende brief. (people v. wende (1979) 25 cal.3d 436.) appellant filed a supplemental brief. in 1997, appellant was convicted of first degree burglary ( 459), forgery ( 470), intimidation or dissuading a witness ( 136.1, subd. (c)(1)), and grand theft of a firearm ( 487, subd. (d)). two prior serious or violent felonies and a prior prison term were found to be true. appellant was sentenced to a total of 81 years to life, consisting of three consecutive terms of 25 years to life on the burglary, forgery, and dissuading a witness counts. on the burglary count, the court also imposed one year for the prior prison term enhancement ( 667.5) and five years for the serious felony enhancement ( 667, subd. (a)). a 25-years-to-life sentence for grand theft of a firearm was stayed. we affirmed. (people v. jones (1998) 67 cal.app.4th 724.) on february 28, 2013, appellant filed a motion for resentencing under sections 1170.126, 667, subdivision (f)(2), 1385, and people v. superior court (romero) (1996) 13 cal.4th 497. the trial court denied the motion with prejudice because appellant was convicted of burglary, a violent felony under section 667.5, subdivision (c)(21), and therefore was ineligible for resentencing under section 1170.126. section 1170.126 applies to a person serving an indeterminate life sentence imposed upon conviction of a felony or felonies not defined as serious or violent for purposes of the three strikes law; such a person may petition for a recall of sentence and request resentencing. (see  1170.126, subd. (a) & (b).) resentencing depends on  1170.126, subd. (e) & (f).) courts of appeal are split on the issue whether a person who is ineligible for resentencing under section 1170.126 may appeal from an order denying a petition to 1 statutory references are to the penal code. 3 recall a sentence, and the supreme court has granted review to consider the appealability of a such an order. (see, e.g., teal v. superior court (2013) 217 cal.app.4th 308, review granted july 31, 2013, s211708; people v. hurtado (2013) 216 cal.app.4th 941, review granted july 31, 2013, s212017; see also people v. leggett (2013) 219 cal.app.4th 846, 852853, petn. for review pending, petn. filed oct. 28, 2013 [citing  1237, subd. (b) and holding that only defendant with substantial rights under section 1170.126 may appeal from order denying petition to recall]; but see people v. wortham (2013) 220 cal.app.4th 1018, 1023 little practical differs order for correctness before dismissing it as nonappealable and in reviewing the order for correctness before affirming it.) under people v. wende, supra, 25 cal.3d 436, we review the record to determine whether there are arguable issues on appeal. to the extent that the issue of eligibility under section 1170.126 is relevant to the merits of his appeal, we conclude that it is not an arguable issue and affirm the order instead of dismissing the appeal. appellant is not eligible for resentencing under 1170.126, subdivision (e) (1) because his current indeterminate life sentence is based on his conviction of two serious or violent felonies: first degree burglary, both a serious and a violent felony for purposes of the three strikes law ( 1192.7, subd. (c)(18) & 667.5, subd. (c)(21)), and intimidation of a witness, a serious felony ( 1192.7, subd. (c)(37)). due to his conviction of these felonies, his sentence under the reform act an indeterminate life sentence. ( 1170.126, subd. (a).) in his supplemental brief, appellant argues the court should have considered his motion as a romero motion to strike his prior strike convictions under section 1385. this is not an arguable issue on appeal. a trial court does not have general jurisdiction to resentence a criminal defendant after execution of sentence has begun. (see people v. howard (1997) 16 cal.4th 1081, 1089.) section 1385 does not grant the court such jurisdiction. dis not clearly unauthorized, so as to be subject to correction at any time. (see people v. turrin (2009) 176 cal.app.4th 1200, 1205.) our review of the record reveals no arguable issues for appeal. 4 disposition the order is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports epstein, p. j. we concur: willhite, j. suzukawa, j.
