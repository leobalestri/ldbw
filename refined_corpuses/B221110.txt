(b)(1)(a)), aguirre filed a motion to suppress on the theory that officer peltonen and officer flores lacked probable are two grounds to legitimately stop the car; . . . no front plate, at least one plate, and the common so that the car is secure. he saw what he said he saw. i find no reason to disbelieve [the officers]. . . . the case proceeded to trial. a jury convicted aguirre on count 1 and count 2 but found the gang allegation to be not true. he admitted one prior prison term allegation and was sentenced to four years in state prison on count 1. on count 2, he was sentenced to three years in prison. the trial court stayed the sentence on count 2 pursuant to section 654. aguirre received a total of 426 days of presentence custody credit. this timely appeal followed. discussion i. standard of review. factual findings where supported by substantial evidence, but we must exercise our independent judgment to determine whether, on the facts found, the search and seizure (people v. avila (1997) 58 cal.app.4th 1069, 10731074, citing people v. leyba (1981) 29 cal.3d 591, 596597.) ii. traffic stop law. under the fourth amendment, a police officer may conduct an investigatory stop of a vehicle only if he possesses a reasonable suspicion based on specific, articulable etained is engaged in u.s. v. lopez-soto (9th cir. 2000) 205 f.3d 1101, 1105; u.s. v. twilley (9th cir. 2000) 222 f.3d 1092, 1095 (twilley).) a passenger may 4 challenge a traffic stop on fourth amendment grounds even if he has no possessory or ownership interest in the vehicle. (ibid.) iii. reasonable suspicion to stop the charger. aguirre argues that the police officers did not have a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity because the charger was not required to have a front license plate and we disagree. a. the absence of a front license plate. when two license plates are issued by the department for use upon a vehicle, they shall be attached to the vehicle for which they were issued, one in the front and the other in the rear. [] (b) when only one license plate is issued for use upon a vehicle, it shall be attached to the rear thereof, . . . the absence of a front licenspeople v. saunders (2006) 38 cal.4th 1129, 1136 (saunders).) . . is not whether . . . [a] vehicle was in full compliance with the law at the time ibid.) based on saunders, officer peltonen was justified in suspecting that the absence of a front license plate on the charger was a violation of the vehicle code and grounds for a traffic stop. even if the charger was actually in compliance with the law, the stop was still lawful. aguirre argues that the evidence at the suppression hearing established that the charger was manufactured to display a single plate in the rear of the vehicle. by implication, he suggests that the department of motor vehicles (dmv) issued only one license plate to mr. luna. in support, aguirre points to the following testimony of officer peltonen at the suppression hearing. officer peltonen understood that if the dmv issued only one license plate, a car was not required to have a license plate in the front. he was aware of only one such type of car, a mitsubishi lancer. as to the charger mr. luna was driving, officer peltonen had no knowledge as to whether it was made to have one license plate or two. 5 the evidence cited is insufficient to establish that the charger needed only one license plate. officer peltonen did not know how many license plates were issued for the charger. nor did he know how many license plates the charger could display based on license plate. the reasonably deducible inference was that the charger was supposed to have two license plates. the argument offered by aguirre is akin to the argument that was offered by the appellant in saunders that only one plate had been issued [for the] vesaunders, supra, 38 cal.4th at p. why that vehicle, a seemingly ordinary pickup truck, would have been issued only one ibid.) in addition, the ibid.) finally, the explain why an officer observing the pickup truck with a missing (ibid.) saunders supports affirming. ony at trial. at one when shown the photograph and asked if he saw a place for a license plate, he said, nly one plate could be mounted on the charger and therefore there was no violation of vehicle code section 5200. this argument is unsound. first, the evidence was not presented at the suppression hearing and is therefore irrelevant to our determination of whether the trial pivotal issue of whether the dmv issued one or two license plates and therefore whether 6 there was a violation of the vehicle code. three, officer not establish why he saw no place to mount a license plate on the front. perhaps the modified after purchase. the record is silent. four, compliance with the law is not the question, as already indicated. the question is whether the stop was based on articulable suspicion of criminal activity. it was. consttwilley, supra, 222 f.3d at p. 1096.) citing twilley, aguirre contends that the traffic stop was e law. law was faulty. his testimony at the suppression hearing confirmed that he was well aware that a vehicle did not have to display a license plate on the front if the dmv issued only one license plate. more importantly, he properly understood that vehicle code section 5200, subdivision (a) required a vehicle to display a license plate on the front and back if two license plates had been issued. thus, his understanding of the law easily passes scrutiny. and, as explained in saunders, the absence of a front license plate is grounds for a traffic stop. our analysis could end here. b. . aguirre argues that officer peltonen did not have a reasonable suspicion that mr. luna violated the vehicle code by crossing the double yellow lines. this argument lacks merit. if double parallel solid yellow lines are in place, a person driving a vehicle shall not drive to the left of the lines, except as permitted in this section. [] . . . [] (d) the markings as specified in subdivision (a) . . . do not prohibit a driver from crossing the marking if (1) turning to the left at an intersection or into or out of a driveway or private road, or (2) making a u-turn under the rules governing that turn, and the markings shall be disregarded when authorized signs 7 have been erected designating offcenter traffic lanes as permitted pursuant to section based on permissibly found that he had an articulable suspicion that mr. luna violated the vehicle code when his left front and rear tires crossed over the double yellow lines and into the opposing lane on two occasions. aguirre contends that vehicle code section 21460 cannot be used to justify the stop because officer peltonen did not cite it in his testimony as the basis for the traffic stop. we cannot concur. initially, officer peltonen stated that when mr. luna crossed the double yellow lines, he violated vehicle code section 21658, subdivision (a). the prosecutor then said: section 21657[,] subdivision [(a)] of the vehicle code. is that the violation that you were to identify the applicable statute in both his police report and his suppression hearing testimony. may designate any highway, roadway, part of a roadway, or specific lanes upon which vehicular traffic shall proceed in one direction at all or such times as shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. when a roadway has been so designated, a vehicle shall be driven only in the direction designated at all or such times as shall be indicated by traffic cross a double yellow line. neither does the next statute, vehicle code section 21658, way has been divided into two or more clearly marked lanes for traffic in one direction, the following rules apply: [] (a) a vehicle shall be driven as nearly as practical entirely within a single lane and shall not be moved from the lane until such movement can be made with reasonable safety. [] (b) official signs may be erected directing slow-moving traffic to use a designated lane 8 or allocating specified lanes to traffic moving in the same direction, and drivers of vehicles shall obey the directi even though officer peltonen cited the wrong statutes at the suppression hearing, a reading of the transcript reveals that the trial court, officer peltonen and the lawyers all understood that the question presented was whether mr. luna had violated the vehicle code when he crossed the double yellow lines. officer peltonen testified that mr. luna did so. in addition, the lawyers argued the issue. in substance if not name, the trial court determined that there was a reasonable suspicion that mr. luna violated vehicle code section 21460. we perceive no prejudice to aguirre, nor any reason to second guess the disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. ______________________________, j. ashmann-gerst we concur: _______________________________, p. j. boren _______________________________, j. chavez
