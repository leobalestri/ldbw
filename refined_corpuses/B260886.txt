filed 3/13/17 p. v. bradford ca2/2 not to be published in the official reports california rules of court, rule 8.1115(a), prohibits courts and parties from citing or relying on opinions not certified for publication or ordered published, except as specified by rule 8.1115(b). this opinion has not been certified for publication or ordered published for purposes of rule 8.1115. in the court of appeal of the state of california second appellate district division two the people, plaintiff and respondent, v. douglas gordon bradford, defendant and appellant. b260886 (los angeles county super. ct. no. ya075023) appeal from a judgment of the superior court of los angeles county. curtis b. rappe, judge. affirmed. donald r. tickle, under appointment by the court of appeal, for defendant and appellant. kamala d. harris, attorney general, gerald a. engler, chief assistant attorney general, lance e. winters, senior assistant attorney general, joseph p. lee and jaime l. fuster, deputy attorneys general, for plaintiff and respondent. * * * * * * 2 in the early morning hours of august 30, 1979, lynne knight (knight) was strangled with a homemade garrote and repeatedly stabbed with a kitchen knife. thirty-one years later, douglas gordon bradford (defendant) was charged with her murder. the case against defendant was entirely circumstantial, as there were no eyewitnesses to the killing, and no forensic evidence tied him to the crime scene. the jury found the circumstantial evidence compelling and convicted him of murder. in this appeal, defendant does not attack the sufficiency of the admitting nearly every piece of circumstantial evidence presented to the jury and excluding evidence of two other suspects the police initially pursued but quickly eliminated. defendant also investigating and charging him, and asserts error with a single jury instruction. we conclude there was no prejudicial error, and affirm his conviction. facts and procedural background i. facts a. the crime around 3:00 a.m. on august 30, 1979, knight was murdered in her backlot apartment. while knight laid in her bed, naked, the killer sat astride her and pushed down on her neck with a homemade garrotethat is, a piece of wire strung between two pieces of wood. the killer crushed her windpipe, so sounded more like the cries of an animal being slaughtered. unable to dispatch her with the garrote, the killer got up, retrieved a 10-inch knife from her kitchen, and proceeded ultimately severing her femoral artery; knight bled to death. 3 the killer, as the killer stabbed one of her breasts after she was dead and rearranged her body to place her right hand over her pubic area. b. with knight defendant and knight had dated for approximately four months in the winter and spring of 1979. knight was a neonatal nurse. during the time they dated, defendant would come and go from a semi-concealed side entrance when she was not home and do chores for her. also during that time, knight asked defendant to be her date to hwedding. ultimately, however, defendant wanted his relationship with knight to be exclusive and long-term; he later went so far as to knight felt differently. in june 1979, she broke it off with defendant. the next day, defendant showed up at her apartment uninvited; knight was with another man. defendant was her. although defendant denied ever going near knight after that incidenteighbor saw defendant at her apartment a week or two before the murder. c. the investigation [a] leave through the sliding door of the apartment, exit through the side entrance, and then take off running. he o police responded and examined the crime scene. the killer left behind the garrote. knight had often worn a medallion on a gold chain necklace; the medallion and the necwas nowhere to be found. 4 in a crumpled wad in or near a trash can. car keys were taken from her purse, although the killer never took her car. there were also blood smears on the curtain for the had worn gloves. police then spoke with several of former boyfriends, all of whom were cooperative except defendant. police interviewed defendant a few days after the murder. as a ploy, police informed him that knight was merely missing, but defendant on his own stated she was dead and was somebody he wanted to put out of his mind. defendant admitted that the nehe had given her, although he changed his story to say he had just helped her buy it. defendant agreed to let the police search his car; in their cursory search, they found no blood but the car reeked of armor all cleanser. the police did not conduct any chemical analysis of the car. defendant offered an alibi: he said he was sailing a two-man sailboat by himself at night, with no running lights, and that he did not get back until 3:00 a.m. because the wind had died out, and he had to row the 4,600-pound boat back into the marina using a four and a half foot long paddle. although defendant was the lead suspect, investigators suspended the investigation in august 1982, for lack of sufficient evidence to convict. in 2000, police reopened knight they re-told investigators that defendant had wanted to marry knight, and that knight would never have crumpled up the invitation for the upcoming wedding because knight was going to participate as the maid of honor. 5 in 2007, police executed search warrants at they seized wire used to hang paintings his mother had painted. from home, they seized a photograph of a crossbow and a manual on how to construct one and an address book that contained the contact information for jerilyn seacat (seacat). police compared the wire seized from defenhome with the wire used to make the garrote. although the low quality of the wire made it impossible to make an exact match, forensic analysis revealed that six different types of eight-strand braided e had the same general characteristics as the eight-strand braided wire in the garrote. police also interviewed seacat. she said she had been dating defendant since 1996. defendant had told her that he was in love with a nurse and almost married al something and she died . . . seacat ended the relationship in 2009, after she learned that defendant was a suspect thereafter, defendant let himself into her house through an unlocked door and waited for her in her bedroom; he repeatedly called her and tried to reconcile, and at one point told her she did not correctly remember what he told her about the nurse he almost married because that nurse had died of melanoma, not from ; he followed her in his car, telling about her new boyfriend; she received an anonymous note comprised of letters cut out from a magazine that asked her to meet at a restaurant she and defendant used to frequent; he left 6 a refurbished bicycle in her yard; and he showed up on her back porch. police also consulted a behavioral crime scene analyst, who provided a report examining the crime scene and opining, among other things, that the killing had been motivated by a preexisting interpersonal conflict and was meant to punish and humiliate knight. in may 2009, police executed an arrest and search warrant police recovered an enlarged photograph of knight, dated a month before her murder, in a desk drawer. ii. procedural background on november 30, 2010, the people charged defendant with a single count of first degree murder (pen. code,  187, subd. (a)), and further alleged that he did so using deadly and dangerous weapons (namely, a garrote and a knife) (pen. code,  12022, subd. (b)). at trial, the people introduced several items of evidence to statements to the police and to seacat, defseacat broke up with him, the similarity between the wire used -the opinion of the behavioral expert that the killer had known knight. defendant put on his alibi defense. the jury found defendant guilty of first degree murder and found the weapon allegation to be true. after the trial court verdict motion to dismiss due to pre-charging delay and motion for a new trial, the court sentenced defendant to 26 years to life, comprised of 25 years to life for the murder plus an additional year for the weapon enhancement. 7 defendant filed this timely appeal. discussion i. pre-charging delay defendant argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss the charge against him on the ground that the prosecutorial delay in charging him violated his constitutional rights. under both federal and california law, d]elay in prosecution that occurs before the accused is arrested or the complaint is filed may constitute a denial of the right to a fair trial and to due process of law under the state and federal constitutions.people v. alexander (2010) 49 cal.4th 846, 874, quoting people v. catlin (2001) 26 cal.4th 81, 107.) to establish a constitutional violation, a defendant must first establish that the delay in charging prejudiced him. (ibid.) prejudice refers to loss of material witnesses due to lapse of time . . . or loss of evidence because of fading memory attributable to the delay. people v. cowan (2010) 50 cal.4th 401, 430.) prejudice will not be presumed and must be established with evidence. (alexander, at p. 874.) if, and only if, the defendant shows prejudice, the prosecution must then offer its reasons for ibid.) purposeful delay almost always warrants dismissal, even where there is minimal prejudice. (cowan, at pp. 430-431.) investigative delaywhether negligent or nottypically requires a much greater showing of prejudice. (ibid.; people v. dunn-gonzalez (1996) 47 cal.app.4th 899the delay, the more prejudice the defense would have to show to require dismissal 8 [p]rosecutors are under no duty to file charges as soon as probable cause exists but before they are satisfied they will be able to establish the suspectand that courts may -guess in that regard. (people v. nelson (2008) 43 cal.4th 1242, 1256 (nelson).) assessment of whether prejudice has been shown, and review for an abuse of discretion a against the justification for delay. (cowan, at p. 431.) a. prejudice the trial court found that defendant had not established that he was prejudiced by the delay in prosecuting him. as is permissible, the court postponed making this finding until after trial, at a time when it could assess the allegedly missing evidence against the full backdrop of the trial that had occurred. (people v. pinedo (2005) 128 cal.app.4th 968, 975.) defendant lists 10 ways, several of which have subparts, in these are irrelevant to his claim of pre-charging delay because re to collect or preserve evidence within the initial stages of the investigation, and not from investigative or prosecutorial delay. specifically, we collecting sufficient quantities of samples from a bracelet knight was wearing to test it for dna matches and in not taking down the name of a possible witness at the marina regarding the feasibility of sailing alibi; that the prosecution did not retain the records of a weather station close to the marina regarding wind readings on the night of the murder, a copy of the questions it posed to another one of 9 , or the on knight years before the murder; and that the prosecution did not retain for future forensic testing , the crumpled wedding (and fingerprint cards containing the prints lifted from some of those items), the jacket worn by a person found a half-mile from the car driven by one of ex-then-or a plastic bag found a half-mile patients from the hospital where knight worked (and the fingerprint card containing a print lifted from the bag).1 what is collect evidence does not people v. montes (2014) 58 cal.4th 809, 837 [g]enerally, due process does not require the police to collect particular items of evidence; people v. frye (1998) 18 cal.4th 894, 943, disapproved on other grounds in people v. doolin (2009) 45 cal.4th 390, 421.) nor does the prosecutionfailure to retain evidence unless it destroyed the evidence in bad faith. (people v. carrasco (2014) 1 the omission of many of these items was not prejudicial in that the hair in the bracelet came from knight herself, and that the semen in her vagina was deposited 24 to 96 hours before her death; that defendant had been ddress book at the time he was under active investigation; that the likelihood of obtaining any meaningful fingerprints from the se the killer had worn gloves; and the jacket worn by the person found a few blocks away was stained, but tested negative for blood. 10 59 cal.4th 924, 961.) there is no evidence that the prosecution acted in bad faith here. the only possible prejudice attributable to the delay in prosecuting defendant stems from (1) the deaths of the coroner , defkni def inability to locate the person found a half-mile from the murder scene, an unnamed person who was at the marina the evening defendant claimed to have gone sailing, or the woman defendant was dating at the ection, however, defendant has not adduced any evidence that the absence of these defendant because any qualified expert witness could have testified to the factual findings contained in the autopsy report. (e.g., people v. trujeque (2015) 61 cal.4th 227, 274-277.) nor was the death of ial because the jury heard the testimony through a taped police interview conducted before his death. defendant has provided no evidence indicating that the other unavailable witnesses would have provided any evidence exonerating him or impeaching the s case. the unnamed person at the marina told police that the wind had died down after dark that night and that a single person could paddle a sailboat like the one defendant allegedly sailed that night. however, this witness told police he never saw defendant that night, and other defense witness testified at trial to the wind conditions and the feasibility of paddling the sailboat. defendant further speculates that the person found a half-mile away might have testified that at the time of girlfriend would have testified 11 that he was out sailing at the time of the murder and was not a violent person. but he provides no basis for believing these two witnesses would make these statements; and, indeed, his girlfriend would at most be able to testify that he was not with her (rather than where he actually was). defendant provides no proffer of what this is speculation, and (people v. smith (2005) 37 cal.4th 733, 755.) b. balancing reason for delay against prejudice case was intentional. instead, the evidence indicates that the prosecution identified defendant as its prime suspect by the early 1980s, but suspended its investigation when it felt it did not have enough evidence to convict him. the prosecution spent the intervening years gathering more evidencetesting certain items for dna matches, obtaining and analyzing the braided wire from -interviewing old witnesses and interviewing new witnesses (such as seacat), and consulting a behavioral expert regarding the crime scene. t is not enough for a defendant to argue that if the prosecutorial agencies had made his or her case a higher priority or had done things a nelson, supra, 43 cal.4th at p. 1257), the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the weak showing of prejudice in this case was outweighed by the prdelay. in support of reversal, defendant cites people v. boysen (2007) 165 cal.app.4th 761, but boysen ruling here. boysen simply held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the prejudice to the defendant outweighed the proffered justification for delay. (id. at pp. 777- 12 ruling is warranted here. ii. erroneous admission of evidence a. braided wire, enlarged photograph of knight, testimony admission of evidence regarding the braided wire seized from his on how to make a crossbow seized from his home, and the testimony of seacat (as the fruit of finding her name and contact information). 1. suppression of evidence under the fourth amendment defendant moved to suppress the above-described evidence, all of which was recovered or derived from the 2007 searches of arguing that the pertinent search warrants were not supported by probable cause. the trial court ruled that the 2007 warrants were supported by ample probable cause; that the 2009 warrant lacked probable cause because the pertinent affidavit was attached to the arrest warrant, but not the search warrant; but that the 2009 search was neverthel exception to the warrant requirement. 13 a. 2007 warrants2 defendant contends that there was no probable cause to support the two 2007 warrants because the information contained in them pertained to a 28-year-old crime and was the accompanying ed for and seized are located on the property zurcher v. stanford daily (1978) 436 u.s. 547, 556; people v. mesa (1975) 14 cal.3d 466, 470 (mesa)-line rule defines the point at which (people v. carrington length of the time lapse alone is not controllialexander v. superior court (1973) 9 cal.3d 387, 393 (alexander)), the (people v. hulland (2003) 110 cal.app.4th 1646, 1652). a ying a finding of probable cause is not stale is part of its determination 2 the people assert that defendant does not have standing to there in 2007. defendant had standing under the rule of vicarious standing in effect in 1979, which permitted a person to constitutional rights rather than just his own. (people v. martin (1955) 45 cal.2d 755, 761, abrogated by cal. const., art. i,  28, subd. (f)(2).) although this rule was abrogated by the voters only to prosecutions for crimes committed on or after its effective people v. smith (1983) 34 cal.3d 251, 258.) thus, we apply the vicarious standing rule to this 1979 murder. 14 appeal, and our narrow task is only to independently assess determination. (people v. kraft (2000) 23 cal.4th 978, 1040-1041; people v. lim (2000) 85 cal.app.4th 1289, 1296.) to conclude that the items sought in the 2007 search warrants of defendannamely, wooden dowels and wire of a type used to make the garrote, and mementos of and further musings regarding his relationship with knightwould likely be present at the time of the search, notwithstanding the fact that the underlying crime occurred in 1979. the recent decision in people v. lazarus (2015) 238 cal.app.4th 734 (lazarus) is almost directly on point. there, the court rejected a staleness argument for a warrant to search for , including occurred over 20 years earlier. (id. at pp. 764-766.) the court at [the defendant] would have continued to retain items evidencing her relationship with [the victim] and her feelings toward [the victim], id. at p. 765.) the same logic applies here. in the 2007 warrants, the police sought personal mementos or reflections, and the braided wire and dowels that the affiant to the warrants stated a person would have no reason to suspect could be matched and thus could be incriminating. there is a substantial basis to believe there was people v. hirata (2009) 175 cal.app.4th 15 1499, 1507-1508 [no probable cause to believe illegal drugs would remain in a location for over a month]; alexander, supra, 9 cal.3d at p. 393 [same, as to drugs a year later].) defendant raises several arguments in response. first, he suggests that lazarus exception to the general rules regarding staleness, and the supreme court has rejected similar categorical exceptions to the fourth amendment. (see flippo v. west virginia (1999) 528 u.s. 11, 14-15 [no crime scene exception]; mincey v. arizona (1978) 437 u.s. lazarus simply applied the usual staleness rules; it did not by words or effect create an exception to them. relatedly, defendant argues that lazarus applies only when the defendant and victim have a continuing relationship. but nothing in lazaruss logic limits it to romantic obsessions that end in crimes short of homicide or the homicide of others. second, defendant attempts to synthesize a new test for evaluating probable cause in cold cases. specifically, he argues that probable cause exists only if (1) someone personally saw the items to be seized on the premises being used to commit the crime, or (2) the items to be seized pertain to a continuing crime. as support for each factor, he respectively cites mesa, supra, 14 cal.3d 466 and people v. gonzalez (1990) 51 cal.3d 1179, 1206, superseded on other grounds by penal code section 1054.9. however, mesa and gonzalez simply found probable cause to exist in each of those circumstances; neither case purported to hold that probable cause could not arise under different circumstances. third, defendant asserts that the warrants were overbroad because they allowed for the search for evidence on his 16 computers. in his view, computers may be searched only if (1) they are an instrumentality of the crime (as per united states v. lemon (8th cir. 2010) 590 f.3d 612, 615-616 and people v. nicholls (2008) 159 cal.app.4th 703, 715), or (2) there is specific information that evidence will be found on computers (as per united states v. payton (9th cir. 2009) 573 f.3d 859, 864). inconsistent with the statute authorizing the issuance of search warrants for items constituting instrumentalities or evidence of felonies ( 1524, subd. (a)(2), (4)), and with lazarus, which she may later purchased (lazarus, supra, 238 cal.app.4th at p. 766). payton, is inconsistent with people v. balint (2006) 138 cal.app.4th 200, 209, which holds that a search warrant authorizing a search for particular items reaches electronic copies as well as hard distinguish between records stored electronically on [a] laptop and documents placed in a filing cabinet . . . .balint. defendant also contends that there was an insufficient ftheir personal thoughts down in electronic documents; this is of no concern because the magistrate could reasonably draw this inference himself or herself (e.g., people v. sandlin (1991) 230 is entitled to draw reasonable inferences about where evidence is likely to be kept) and because lazarus upheld a nearly identical search. because there was probable cause to believe that the braided wire, dowels and mementos would be present in 17 remaining items admitted at trial were in plain view as the executing officers searched for those items (see generally horton v. california (1990) 496 u.s. 128), the trial court properly denied from the 2007 warrants. b. 2009 warrant defendant argues that the trial court erred in concluding that the people could rely upon the good faith exception to the warrant requirement to save the concededly invalid 2009 warrant. under the good faith exception, the fourth amendment does not mandate the suppression of evidence obtained with a d] with opeople v. macabeo (2016) 1 cal.5th 1206, 1220; united states v. leon (1984) 468 u.s. 897, 918.) the good faith exception does not apply if (1) affidavitor recklessly provided false information in the affidavit; (2) issuing magistrate wholly aba the so lacking in indicia of probable cause as to render official belief in its existence entirely unreasonable(4) the wart . . . that the executing people v. willis (2002) 28 cal.4th 22, 31-32, quoting leon, at pp. 919, 923.) although the 2009 search ause the affidavit appended to the 2009 arrest warrant was not also appended to the search warrant, the affidavit at the time he signed both warrants, and the officers acted in good faith when 18 relying on the search warrant. defendant argues that the affidavit was so overbroad as to be facially deficient, but we reject that argument for the reasons noted above. defendant also s to magistrates who get paid more if they sign warrants (tumey v. ohio (1927) 273 u.s. 510, 522-523), to magistrates who are simultaneously prosecutors (coolidge v. new hampshire (1971) 403 u.s. 443, 449-450), or to magistrates who go along with police in executing warrants (lo-ji sales, inc. v. new york (1979) 442 u.s. 319, 326-327); it does not apply to magistrates, as defendant suggests, who simply fail to catch a typo regarding the date of the murder. 2. relevance of crossbow evidence defendant argues that the trial court erred in admitting (1) an image of a crossbow and a manual on how to make one, , and (2) testimony that a crossbow was similar to a garrote in that ucted at home and both were weapons that cou defendant did not object to the first items of evidence, so he cannot assign it as error on appeal. (evid. code,  353.)3 the trial court overruled his relevance objection to the latter testimonyevidentiary rulings for an abuse of discretion. (people v. harris (2005) 37 cal.4th 310, 337 [relevance]; people v. clark (2016) 63 cal.4th 522, 586 (clark) [discretionary exclusion of unduly prejudicial evidence].) 3 all further statutory references are to the evidence code unless otherwise indicated. 19 the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting any of the evidence regarding the crossbow. evidence is relevant if it fact that is of consequence to the determination of the acti( 210.) a court may nevertheless exclude relevant evidence of undue prejudice, of confusing the issues, or of misleading the although evidence that a defendant possessed a weapon not used in the charged crime is not relevant to show that he is the kind of person who surrounds himself with deadly weapons(people v. archer (2000) 82 cal.app.4th 1380, 1392-1393), vant people v. merriman (2014) 60 cal.4th 1, 81-82.) in this case, no crossbow was ever found or introduced. instead, the testifying officer explained that the manual on how to make a crossbow was relevant to show that defendant was the killernot because he surrounds himself with deadly weaponsbut because defendant, like the killer, had taken steps to learn how to make a homemade weapon of medieval origin. although this evidence may be of marginal relevance, its admission was not an abuse of discretion. 3. absence of foundation to introduce evidence of match between braided wire in garrote and wire found in defendant contends that the trial court erred in admitting evidence that six types of eight-strand wire recovered from the same general characteristics as the eight-strand wire used to make the g in particular, defendant argues that (1) this evidence is not relevant absent an 20 , (2) this evidence was at best marginally relevant, such that its admission was more prejudicial than probative under section 352, and (3) the admission of this evidence violated his federal constitutional rights to due process and a fair trial. routine application of provisions of the state evidence code law (people v. jones (2013) 57 cal.4th 899, 957 (jones)), the validity gs were an abuse of discretion (clark, supra, 63 cal.4th at p. 597). the wire match evidence was relevant, even without proof was manufactured prior to 1979. as noted above, any tendency in reason to prove or disprov, italics added.) here, the fact that police recovered braided wire of the same basic type as the wire used to kill knight from the home where defendant lived at was relatively uncommon in 1979that defendant had at his disposal the materials necessary to manufacture the garrote used to strangle knight and thus that inference may have been weak, . . . that does not make the evidence irrelevan (people v. farnam (2002) 28 cal.4th 107, 156-157 [upholding admission of the knife consistent with the sharp instrument used to gain entry to scene of a crime], citing people v. freeman (1994) 8 cal.4th 450, 491.) 21 for much the same reason, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the probative value of this evidence was not substantially outweighed by the danger of undue prejudice. in this vein, defendant argues that the expert opinion people v. moore (2011) 51 cal.4th 386 and people v. lucas (1995) 12 cal.4th 415. however, moore held that it was error to elicit an answer to a hypothetical question that was unsupported by the facts (moore, at p. 405) and lucas held that it was error not to strike evidence premised on the existence of a preliminary fact that was never proven (lucas, at pp. 467-468); neither case dictates the exclu defendant also asserts that this testimony should have been excluded because there was no proof he ever possessed the garrote. although such proof certainly would have made the tating evidence, its absence does not render the testimony inadmissible as irrelevant or under section 352. 4. ave been excluded not only as fruit of the unlawful search of his home in 2007, but also because (1) her testimony regarding his behavior after seacat broke up with him was improper character evidence, memory of his account was wrong was improper evidence of his consciousness of guilt. a. improper character evidence or her character . . . is [generally] inadmissible when offered to 22 prove hviolence as charged ( 1109, subd. (a)(1)). in deciding whether to admit other incidents of domestic violence propensity, a court must assess (1) whether the other incident id., subds. (a)(1) & (d)(3)); (2) whether the probative value of the other incident is substantially outweighed by the danger of undue prejudice under section any corroboration and id., subds. (a)(1) & (d)(3)); and (3) if the id., subd. (e)). there are two defi the narrower definition set forth in penal code section d no more broader definition set forth in family code section 6211 applies. (id., subd. (d)(3).) we review the admission of such evidence for an abuse of discretion (people v. johnson (2010) 185 cal.app.4th 520, 539), but examine questions of statutory interpretation de novo (people v. prunty (2015) 62 cal.4th 59, 71 (prunty)). purposes of showing his propensity to commit domestic violence. pen. code,  646.9), code section 6211 (people v. kovacich (2011) 201 cal.app.4th 863, 894). however, his conduct toward seacat did not occur wipeople 23 v. ogle (2010) 185 cal.app.4th 1138, 1143 (ogle)). as a result, we must apply penal code sinjury, or placing another person in reasonable apprehension of imminent serious bodily injury to himself or herself, or ano (pen. code,  13700, subds. (a) & (b).) against seacat, while undeniably disturbing, did not place her in inent serious (ibid.) to show propensity for committing domestic violence was not prejudicial because the same testimony was admissible to prove his intent, plan or preparation, and identity under section 1101, subdivision (b). section 1109 expressly preserves the admissibility of domestic violence evidence for purposes other than propensity. ( 1109, subd. (a)(1).) and section 1101, subdivision (b) authorizes admission of other identity.when admitted to prove intent, the other act and prove a common scheme or plan, the acts must have a concurrence of common featuresidentity, the acts mudistinctive as to support an inference that the same person committed them. [citation.] (people v. armstrong (2016) 1 cal.5th 432, 456-457; people v. soper (2009) 45 cal.4th 759, 776 & fn. 8.) in this case, defen 24 confronting her after knight broke up with him. it is compelling evidence that defendant engages in a similar pattern of conductnamely, that he fixates on a woman after she rejects himthat is relevant to show his intent, a common plan or scheme and even his identity. ogle is almost directly on point. there, the court of appeal concluded that the trial court erred in admitting evidence of prior stalking activity under section 1109 and thus should have instructed the jury not to consider that activity as evidence of the ity to engage in such conduct. (ogle, supra, 185 cal.app.4th at pp. 1143-1145.) however, the court determined that the prior stalking activity was still admissible to section 1101, subdivision (b). (ogle, at pp. 1143-1144.) the real error, the court reasoned, was the fact that the jury was allowed to consider the prior stalking activity as proof of the as well as for the more limited purpose of proving his intent. (ibid.) however, the court concluded that it was not reasonably probable that an instruction limiting the admission of this evidence to proof of intent would have led to a more favorable result. (id. at p. 1145, citing people v. watson (1956) 46 cal.2d 818, 836-837.) we come to the same conclusion as the court in ogle. although defendant did not kill seacat, his post-breakup behavior toward seacat was otherwise very similar to his post-breakup behavior toward knight; as such, it was admissible to prove his intent, common scheme or plan, and identity. the probative value of the evidence for these purposes was not substantially outweighed by the danger of undue prejudice. ( 352.) consideration of that evidence to those purposes, it is not 25 reasonably likely that such a limiting instruction would have lead to a more favorable result because was strong evidence of intent, common scheme or plan and identity, but weak evidence of propensity. as defendant points out, he did not kill seacat and was never violent with her; his conduct in stalking seacat thus provides, at most, tepid support for the argument that he had the propensity to kill knight. it is also not inflammatory vis--vis the charged murder. by contrast, his stalking conduct with seacat is strong evidence of how he fixates on a woman after rejection and thus provides compelling evidence of his intent, common scheme or plan, and thus identity. because the evidence of his conduct toward seacat was most relevant for the purposes for which it was properly admissible, its erroneous admission for an impermissible purpose to which it was less relevant is harmless. when considered alongside the other evidence tending to show that defendant was the perpetrator (his violent outburst toward knight, the missing necklace and crumpled wedding invitation, his knowledge of admission of this evidence without a limiting instruction is also harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. (see chapman v. california (1967) 386 u.s. 18, 24.) b. improper evidence of consciousness of guilt that tends to prove he is guilty of the crime from which he is trying to distance himself. (people v. louis (1984) 159 cal.app.3d 156, 160, disapproved on other grounds in people v. mickey (1991) 54 cal.3d 612; people v. hannon (1977) 19 cal.3d 588, 599.) we 26 review the admission of such evidence for an abuse of discretion. (prunty, supra, 62 cal.4th at p. 71.) defendant argues that the trial court abused its discretion omething and she died . . . right away and (2) defendant subsequently tried to convince seacat that this prio and that seacat was confused. specifically, defendant contends that this evidence (1) was speculative, (2) did not reflect a consciousness of guilt, and (3) was the product of manipulation by law enforcement. argument, defendant asserts that the evidence was speculative because there was no corroborative evidence he and knight almost got married; to the contrary, he points out, knight did not want to marry him. this argument ignores that the source of was defendant himself, and the jury was entitled to credit her testimony regarding his prior statements. (people v. young (2005) 34 cal.4th 1149, 1181 [the about the mutuality of the affection between himself and knight is what gives rise to the inference of a consciousness of guilt. with respect to his second argument, defendant argues that he had other reasons to lie to seacat about his prior relationship with knight other than his guilt of knight murder, such as the fact that he was trying to keep seacat from learning that he was married to another woman while he was dating seacat, that he was consequently trying to keep seacat disinterested in marrying him, and that heas would any 27 innocent personwas merely denying murder. he further asserts that he had no reason to lie to seacat thus, he argues, other inferences can be drawn from his lies to seacat. however, it is particularly when both sets of inferences are reasonable. (people v. hubbard (2016) 63 cal.4th 378, 392.) argues that the police manipulated seacat into believing that hat her testimony was tainted. seacat merely related to police what defendant had said to her before the police first interviewed her, and what he said after they had contacted her; the fact that police told seacat their working theory about defendant does not amount to d and reveal no manipulation. defendant nevertheless cites people v. kennedy (2005) 36 cal.4th 595, overruled in part on other grounds in people v. williams (2010) 49 cal.4th 405, bermudez v. city of new york (2d cir. 2015) 790 f.3d 368, and alcala v. woodford (9th cir. 2003) 334 f.3d 862 to support his argument, but those cases are irrelevant. (kennedy, at p. 609 [dealing with unduly suggestive identification procedures]; bermudez, at p. 376 [denying summary judgment in civil suit against prosecutors to bring charges was tainted by misleading information about how witnesses came to identify the civil plaintiff as the perpetrator]; alcala, at p. 877 [dealing with exclusion of defense witness testimony].) 28 b. testimony of behavioral crime scene expert defendant argues that the trial court erred in allowing the the crime scene evidence, that (1) knight was specifically targeted by the killer, (2) the killing was motivated by a preexisting interpersonal conflict, and the breast and staged her body after she was dead because he wanted to punish and humiliate her, (3) the killer tried to make the scene look like a robbery and sexual assault by taking her keys and checkbook, but not using either, (4) the killer acted with premeditation, taking the time to make a homemade garrote and wearing gloves to the scene. we review the admission of expert testimony for an abuse of discretion. (people v. jackson (2013) 221 cal.app.4th 1222, 1237 (jackson).) defendant argues that this evidence was inadmissible on a number of grounds. 1. threshold admissibility a witness may testify as an expert, if he possesses the on s sufficiently beyond common experience that the opinion of an expert would assist the trier of [b]ased on matter . . . perceived by or personally relied upon by an expert in forming an opinion upon the subject . . . 720, 801, subds. (a) & (b).) to enforce these requirementsexpert opinion testimony that is (1) based on matter of a type on which an expert may not reasonably rely, (2) based on reasons unsupported by the material on which the expert relies, or (3) sargon enterprises, inc. v. university of 29 southern california (2012) 55 cal.4th 747, 771-772.) as part of this responsibility, a trial court may exclude expert testimony if it id. at p. 771.) the trial court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the behavioral expert in this case was qualified, and that the substance of his opinion was analytically sound. jackson is directly on point. there, the court of appeal affirmed the admission of testimony from the very same expert who testified in this case. (jackson, supra, 221 cal.app.4th at pp. 1225, 1228.) in jacksonscene from a behavioral and physical evidence forensic and opined that factors from the crime scene sulted from interpersonal -who such assault took place. (id. at pp. 1228-1233.) the court of appeal upheld the admission of this testimony because the trial court could reasonably conclude the jury would be assisted by id. at p. 1239.) defendant challenges this analysis on three grounds. first, e it is not scientific. but the evidence code permits expert testimony to be grounded in experience as well as science. ( 720; people v. prince (2007) 40 cal.4th 1179, 1219-1220 (prince) [experience-based testimony permitted].) second, defendant contends that court did not come to the same conclusion is because it erroneously excluded several academic articles defendant offered 30 against the testimony. without a witness to lay foundation for those articles, they were hearsay and thus well even if the studies had been admitted and considered, in light of jackson, supra, 221 cal.app.4th 1222, the court would not have abused its discretion in rejecting those articles and in testimony. was unnecessary because jurors could look at the crime scene evidence and draw the same conclusions as the expert. however, the jury need [not] be wholly ignorant of the subject matter before an expert may testify (people v. brown (2014) 59 cal.4th 86, 101), for in such circumstances, it mrn from a person with extensive training in crime scene a(prince, at p. 1223). 2. lack of general acceptance in the scientific community its admissibility turns on further findingsnamely, s reliable in the relevant scientific community (2) that the expert is properly (people v. jackson (2016) 1 cal.5th 269, 315-316, quoting people v. bolden (2002) 29 cal.4th 515, 544-545 [describing the test articulated in people v. kelly (1976) 17 cal.3d 24].) a judicial finding as to the reliability of scientifically based evidence is required because scientific evidence is definitive truth which the expert need only accurately recognize misled by the that may surround unproven scientific methods. (people v. stoll (1989) 49 cal.3d 1136, 1156 (stoll); 31 people v. mcdonald (1984) 37 cal.3d 351, 372-373.) we independently review whether a particular technique is subject to kelly. (people v. jackson, supra, 1 cal.5th at p. 316.) d on any make the additional findings required for scientific evidence. the experience with crime scenes and the conclusions he drew from the objective facts of the crime scene, not on any scientific analysis. it makes no sense to require that such testimony be scientifically sound. (prince, supra, 40 cal.4th at p. 1225 [finding of scientific acceptance not required for expert testimony comparing crime scenes for commonalities]; stoll, supra, 49 cal.3d at pp. 1157-1158 [finding of scientific acceptance not required for expert testimony grounded in psychiatric diagnosis]; people v. townsel (2016) 63 cal.4th 25, 46, fn. 3 [same]; cf. in re amber b. (1987) 191 cal.app.3d 682, 691 [finding of scientific acceptance required for expert testimony opining that child abuse occurred based on how the alleged victim behaves with anatomically correct dolls]; in re sara m. (1987) 194 cal.app.3d 585, 592 [same].) defendant cites cases from other jurisdictions that require crime scene analysis to be scientifically validated, but those decisions are contrary to california law and are thus irrelevant. 3. impermissible profile evidence an expert witness may not offer an opinion that a defendant is guilty (people v. torres (1995) 33 cal.app.4th 37, 46-people v. robbie (2001) 92 cal.app.4th 1075, 1084-y in this case did not transgress either of these limits because it did not offer an opinion on the 32 defendant could be compared. (accord, jackson, supra, 221 cal.app.4th at pp. 1239-1240 [rejecting argument that this same state of mind. 4. failure to exclude under section 352 relevant expert testimony may be excluded as more prejudicial than probative under section 352. however, the trial clark, supra, 63 cal.4th at p. 586), and defendant has not established an abuse of that discretion as a matter of law. 5. constitutional violations testimony complied s constitutional rights were not violated. (jones, supra, 57 cal.4th at p. 957.) iii. erroneous exclusion of evidence defendant contends that the trial court erred in excluding the police initially investigated, but ultimately ruled out as suspects. the admissibility of evidence that a third party other than the defendant committed the charged crime turns on two factors: people v. vines (2011) 51 cal.4th 830, 860, quoting people v. hall (1986) 41 cal.3d 826, 833 (hall)); and (2) whether the probative value of such evidence is nevertheless substantially outweighed by danger of undue prejudice, of confusing the issues, or of misleading the jury (people 33 v. mcwhorter (2009) 47 cal.4th 318, 367-368 (mcwhorter);  352). it people v. bradford (1997) 15 cal.4th 1229, 1325 (bradford).) a defendant seeking to admit that the third person committed the actbut it is not enough to mere motive or opportunity to commit the crime. (hall, at p. 833.) we review a trial courexclude such evidence for an abuse of discretion. (clark, supra, 63 cal.4th at p. 597.) a. evidence regarding gerardo juarez (juarez) ment and detained juarez a half-mile from the apartment. he was disheveled and wearing a stained jacket. nlook at juarez from behind, he guy,apartment based on his build and the color of his jacket. police later determined such as her car keys, purse or necklace), even though the crime scene was bloody and those items were missing. revealed no connection whatsoever to knight. the neighbor later told police said he was wrong in identifying juarez from behind be the trial court excluded finding that the evidence linking juarez to the murder was not 34 it was solely from behind. the trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding this evidence. juarez had, at most, the opportunity to commit the crime. that is not enough. (hall, supra, 41 cal.3d at p. 833.) the only other evidence linking juarez leaving entirely on seeing him from behind and was later recanted. even i(bradford, supra, 15 cal.4th at p. 1325), it is of such minimal probative value that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding it under section 352 given the absence of any other evidence connecti defendant argues that it was error to exclude evidence of tion of juarez from behind was not the product of an unduly suggestive identification procedure under the due process clause. (see generally people v. cunningham (2001) 25 cal.4th 926, 989-990.) but whether or not the (or should not) have been excluded on the basis of police-coerced pressure has nothing to do with whether it is reliable enough to support a link between , which turns on the totality of evidence. although the due process precedent also identifies the factors bearing on whether an identification is reliable (ibid.), the cure the fact that it was made from behind and later recanted, or 35 compensate for the absence of any other link between juarez and b. evidence regarding joe giarrusso (giarrusso) giarrusso and knight dated for a few years in 1975 and 1976, but were just good friends by 1979. because knight wedding, she invited him to her apartment for dinner on the night she would be murdered. giarrusso arrived at kapartment at 8:30 p.m. and left around 11:40 p.m. or 11:50 p.m. d he saw a light blue volkswagen bugthe type of car giarrusso droveparked .m. or 11:40 p.m. that night. arrived sometime after 11:00 p.m. and was with her the rest of the night. looked out the window af when the neighbor was re-interviewed 24 years later, the neighbor said he looking light blue vw stopped at an in. the neighbor also said he saw giarrusso again between 2007 and 2010, even though giarrusso had died in 1994. when police initially contacted giarrusso abouwith police by granting them permission to search his house and his car. no evidence linking him to the murder was recovered. commission remembrance that he saw a light blue 36 volkswagena fairly common car in 1979after the police arrived sufficiently linked giarrusso to the murder. the trial court did not err in excluding this evidence because it reflects, at best, that giarrusso had the opportunity to hours before her death and possibly seen in the neighborhood after her death. as noted above, opportunity is not enough. (hall, supra, 41 cal.3d at p. 833.) defendant raises several challenges to this conclusion. first, he argues that the trial court was wrong to discount the remembrance that he saw a light blue volkswagen after the police arrived, asserting that there was no evidence on the frequency of light blue volkswagens in that neighborhood in 1979, discounting in those circumstances invaded the province of the jury to assess the weight of the evidence. defendant is wrong. part of the assessment of whether to admit third-party culpability evidence is weighing its probative value against its potential for undue prejudice, and that process necessarily involves weighing the evidence. (accord, people v. fruits (2016) 247 cal.app.4th 188, 191.) in so doing, the court also properly considered that giarrusso did not in any way match l description of the person the neighbor second, defendant asserts that trial court gave insufficient weight to a variety of facts that tend to show that giarrusso might be the killernamely, that giarrusso knew about the side was, that he had a bandage on his thumb when police spoke with him a few days after the murder, and that he had once hit knight while they dated. however, none of these facts forges a greater 37 from his years-long friendship with her; he said he knew what a garrote was because he had seen james bond films where they were used; been a wound inflicted from handling the garrote because the killer had worn gloves to avoid such injuries. any prior violence between giarrusso and knight, aside from being remote in time, was not admisa history of violencedoes not amount to direct or circumstantial evidence linking the third person to the actual perpetration of the crime.mcwhorter, supra, 47 cal.4th at p. 373; prince, supra, 40 cal.4th at pp. 1239-1242 [same].) third, defendant argues that the trial court erred in autopsy report that knight had last eaten two to three hours before her death at 3:00 a.m. defendant asserts that this conclusion dinner before he left at 11:40 p.m. or 11:50 p.m., and thus shows that giarrusso might have been at her apartment later than he said. the trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the findings fall within the public record exception to the hearsay rule (people v. wardlow (1981) 118 cal.app.3d 375, 387-388), defendant presented no admissible expert testimony that the contents of her stomach at the time of death could be used to calculate when and what she last ate. what is more, the court had evidence before it indicating that the opinion defendant sought to introduce was not scientifically sound. but even if the court had considered the conclusions in the report, that evidence 38 would have demonstrated that giarrusso was at apartment later than he said but would not have created any further link between himself and the actual commission of her murder. lastly, defendant argues that the exclusion of this evidence violated his constitutional rights. because the exclusion was consistent with the rules of evidence, there was no constitutional violation. (jones, supra, 57 cal.4th at p. 957.) iv. instructional error defendant asserts that the trial court erred by instructing the jury with calcrim no. 315, the pattern jury instruction that enumerates th the consider in evaluating that testimony. (calcrim no. 315.) two the perpetratorperpetrator ibid., italics added.) defendant argues calcrim no. 315 implies that some witness identified him as inconsistent with the evidence and thus improperly reduced the we review claims of instructional error de novo. (people v. johnson (2016) 6 cal.app.5th 505, 509-510.) there was no instructional error in this case. the the defendantperson who had a fight with knight after he and knight broke up and as the person seen nea 39 before her murder. the mischief defendant complains aboutnamely, the implication that someone identified him as the perpetrator when there was no evidence of suchof the 14 factors. in assessing whether the jury read the as implying that someone had identified defendant as the actual killer, we look at r there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury misunderstood or misapplied people v. covarrubias (2016) 1 cal.5th 838, 906.) there was no reasonable likelihood here. as noted above, the thrust of the instruction is how to evaluate identifications of the defendant; only two of the factors even refer to identifications of the perpetrator. more to the point, neither the trial court nor any of the attorneys otherwise represented or argued that someone had seen defendant at the scene of murder as it was occurring or soon thereafter. under these circumstances, we conclude there was no reasonable likelihood the jury would have construed calcrim no. 315 as suggesting there was such evidence or that the people were relieved from proving s identity as the perpetrator . v. cumulative error because there was only one error, there is no error to cumulate. (people v. sandoval (1992) 4 cal.4th 155, 198.) 40 disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. ______________________, j. hoffstadt we concur: _________________________, acting p. j. chavez _________________________, j.* goodman * retired judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
