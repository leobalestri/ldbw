(a) and (c)(2)), his 2006 conviction for driving or taking a 10851, subd. license ( 470b) and forgery ( 470, subd. (a)), and his 2015 conviction for offering a false or forged instrument ( 115, subd. (a)).2 mountford now seeks to challenge his 2003 guilty plea to petty theft with a prior ( 666) and false personation of another ( 529). his guilty plea, and did not issue a certificate of probable cause. we accordingly lack jurisdiction to hear an appeal from the trial . we instead treat error coram vobis filed initially in this court, and for the reasons set forth below, deny it. background on june 16, 2003, mountford took $327 worth of merchandise from a store without paying for it, and was apprehended by a security guard in the parking lot. when 1 all unspecified statutory references are to the penal code. 2 people v. mountford (mar. 28, 2019, b286803, b287202) [nonpub. opn.]; people v. mountford (may 28, 2019, b287245) [nonpub. opn.]; people v. mountford (oct. 31, 2019, b286655) [nonpub. opn.]. 3 apprehended, he gave authorities a false name. following his plea of guilty, which included the admission he had served prior prison terms for purposes of sentencing enhancements under section 667.5, subdivision (b), mountford was sentenced to an upper term of three years on the petty theft with a prior offense, and a concurrent term of two years for the false personation offense. the trial court dismissed the findings of separate prior prison terms pursuant to section 1385. we affirmed conviction on appeal. (people v. mountford (sep. 8, 2005, b172092) [nonpub. opn.] [2005 wl 2158817].) in 2018, mountford filed a request for a certificate of probable cause along with a motion to withdraw his 2003 guilty plea. mountford asserted the 15-year delay in seeking to was caused by not being advised of the adverse consequences that accepting the plea would expose me to future sentencing enhancements, both in california and under the laws of other states, and that he was now exposed to a life sentence in a nevada state case as a habitual criminal. mountford acknowledged the minute order of the 2003 hearing at which his plea was taken stated that he was advised of [t]he possible consequences of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, including the maximum penalty and administrative sanctions and the possible legal effects and maximum penalties incident to subsequent convictions for the same or similar offenses. he claimed error, however, because he was not advised of the adverse legal consequences from future convictions not related to section 529, nor was he advised of potential adverse sentencing consequences he could suffer under the laws of different states. 4 on august 21, 2018, the trial court issued a minute order stating that it had read and considered request/motion, and that september 11 order did not expressly address the request for a certificate of probable cause. mountford timely appealed. discussion a. mountford cannot appeal torder mountford contends we must remand for further proceedings because the court did not rule on his request for a certificate of probable cause. he further contends the trial court erred in denying his motion to withdraw his guilty plea by failing to state reasons for the denial. neither of these claims can be raised by way of direct appeal. section 1237.5 provides that a defendant cannot appeal from a judgment of conviction upon a plea of guilty unless the defendant obtains a certificate of probable cause for the appeal from the trial court. ( 1237.5, subd. (b); see also people v. johnson (2009) 47 cal.4th 668, 676.) our supreme court has (people v. mendez (1999) 19 cal.4th 1084, 1099.) section 1237.5 to the extent mountford sought to challenge the trial required to do so by writ of mandate. (people v. johnson, supra, 47 cal.4th at p. 676 [if the trial court wrongfully refuses to issue a certificate, the defendant may seek a writ of mandate from the appellate court].) he failed to do so. we accordingly lack jurisdiction ts on direct appeal. 5 b. coram vobis is denied we have the option to treat appeal as an original proceeding in this court for a writ of error coram vobis. (people v. forest (2017) 16 cal.app.5th 1099, 1108.) the basis for the issuance of a writ of error coram vobis is substantially the same as for a writ of error coram nobis, the difference being coram vobis is addressed to the appellate court that affirmed the judgment, while coram nobis is addressed to the trial court that issued the judgment.3 to avoid subsequent and duplicative briefing, and conserve scarce judicial resources, we elect to treat the appeal as a petition for writ of error coram vobis in this court and the record in the inoperative appeal as the record in this original proceeding.ibid.) may be granted when three requirements are met: (1) the petitioner has shown that some fact existed which, without fault of his own, was not presented to the court at the trial on the merits, and which if presented would have prevented the rendition of judgment; (2) the petitioner has shown that the newly discovered evidence 3 given the procedural posture, mountford could not seek a writ of error coram nobis in the trial court. motions to set aside and petitions in the nature of coram nobis may be addressed to the trial court after judgment, if there has been no affirmance on appeal (. . .  people v. wadkins (1965) 63 cal.2d 110, 113.) here, mountford appealed to this court following his guilty plea, and the judgment was affirmed. any petition for a writ of error in the court which affirmed the judgment on appeal. 1265, subd. (a).) 6 does not go to the merits of the issues tried; and (3) the petitioner has shown that the facts upon which he relies were not known to him and could not in the exercise of due diligence have been discovered by him at any time substantially earlier than the time (people v. castaneda (1995) 37 cal.app.4th 1612, 1618-1619.) independently evaluate[] whether the newly discovered fact presented in the petition warrants relief. [citations.] . . . [t]his is a mixed question of law and fact which we review de novo, much like the question whether a habeas corpus petitioner has proven by a preponderance of the evidence facts that establish a basis for relief. [citation.] as in such proceedings, where the evidentiary record consists of exhibits attached to the petition, we independently review the record. people v. forest, supra, 16 cal.app.5th at p. 1109.) a postjudgment motion to cseas[citation.] thus, the [appellate] court may properly consider the defendants delay in has elapsed between the guilty plea and the motion to withdraw the plea, the burden is on the defendant to explain and justify the delay. (people v. castaneda, supra, 37 cal.app.4th at p. 1618.) lengthy delaythat he did not realize a guilty plea would expose him to future sentencing enhancementsis not credible. one of mountfordpetty theft with a priorwas after all enhanced for charging purposes because of a prior conviction. additionally, as part of his 2003 guilty plea mountford admitted prior prison terms pursuant to section 667.5, subdivision (b), understanding that they would increase his sentence, before the 7 trial court ultimately dismissed them pursuant to section 1385. mountford was convicted again in 2006, 2010, 2011, and 2015, and does not contend his extensive prior criminal history played no role in the discussion of what sentence he should receive in one or more of those proceedings. nor does mountford provide any details regarding when he became aware of the nevada statute as compared to when he filed his motion. mountford therefore has not justified the lengthy delay in challenging his 2003 plea. even if we considered the petition timely, it would still fail. the allegedly newly discovered enhanced sentence if mountford was convicted of a crime in another jurisdiction. mountford acknowledges that the trial court had no duty to warn him of possible collateral consequences before accepting his plea, and that such collateral consequences include the possibility of enhanced punishment in the event of a future conviction.4 (e.g., people v. moore (1998) 69 cal.app.4th 626, 629-630; people v. crosby (1992) 3 cal.app.4th 1352, 1355-1356.) ~(aob 17-18)~ 4 mountford requests that we take judicial notice of a hearing transcript for his 2003 guilty plea in the trial court file, which his counsel has transcribed in his opening brief. because of the passage of time, the court reporter destroyed the original notes and could not prepare a copy of the transcript. while we with california rules of court, rule 8.252(a), we assume for purposes of deciding this petition that mountford was not in fact maximum penalties incident to subsequent minute order for his guilty plea, which is the underlying reason for the judicial notice request. 8 the potential future legal effect of his guilty plea is not a newly discovered fact, because ignorance of a future legal consequence people v. ibanez (1999) 76 cal.app.4th 537, 546, fn. omitted.) the writ of error coram vobis is not available where a defendant voluntarily and with knowledge of the facts pleaded guilty or admitted alleged prior convictions because of ignorance or mistake as to the legal effect of those facts. (people v. kim (2009) 45 cal.4th 1078, 1093.) mountford argues that our supreme court nevertheless has permitted challenges to guilty pleas even where proper advisements were made, citing people v. patterson (2017) 2 cal.5th 885 (patterson). in patterson, the defendant pled guilty to a charge that rendered him subject to mandatory deportation. (id. at p. 889.) the defendant filed a timely motion to withdraw his plea under section 1018 on the grounds of mistake or ignorance. the supreme court held the standard section 1016.5 advisement that a criminal conviction may have adverse immigration consequencesibid.) did not bar the defendant, as a matter of law, from showing good cause under section 1018 to withdraw his plea. the court accordingly remanded the matter to the tso that the trial court may exercise its discretion to determine whether [the defendant] has shown good cause to withdraw his guilty plea on grounds of mistake or ignorance.id. at p. 899, fn. omitted.) relying on patterson, mountford argues he too should not be barred from showing good cause to withdraw his guilty plea. mountford, however, is ineligible for relief under section 1018 (which requires on its face the motion to withdraw be made before judgment), and patterson is thus of limited guidance. 9 second, the required section 1016.5 advisement in patterson arguably misled the defendant about the immigration consequences of his pleasuggesting the plea might not have immigration consequences when those consequences were mandatory. here, mountford was not misadvised of anything. finally, patterson holds that the defendant was not barred as a matter of law from seeking to show good cause for withdrawal of his guilty plea. here, we do not hold mountford is legally barred from seeking to show good causeindeed, we have treated his ineffective appeal as a petition for a writ of error coram vobis. we hold instead that mountford has not in fact shown good cause for withdrawal of his plea because he raises a legal, and not a factual question, about the potential future consequences of his 2003 guilty plea. disposition the petition for a writ of error coram vobis is denied. not to be published weingart, j.* we concur: rothschild, p. j. johnson, j. * judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
