filed 10/1/15 p. v. robinson ca2/2 not to be published in the official reports california rules of court, rule 8.1115(a), prohibits courts and parties from citing or relying on opinions not certified for publication or ordered published, except as specified by rule 8.1115(b). this opinion has not been certified for publication or ordered published for purposes of rule 8.1115. in the court of appeal of the state of california second appellate district division two the people, plaintiff and respondent, v. john l. robinson, defendant and appellant. b256799 (los angeles county super. ct. no. ma058830) appeal from a judgment of the superior court of los angeles county. richard e. naranjo, judge. affirmed. cynthia l. barnes, under appointment by the court of appeal, for defendant and appellant. kamala d. harris, attorney general, gerald a. engler, chief assistant attorney general, lance e. winters, senior assistant attorney general, scott a. taryle, and davis a. wildman, deputy attorneys general, for plaintiff and respondent. * * * * * * 2 john l. robinson (defendant) appeals his convictions and resulting 18 year state prison sentence for possession of cocaine for sale, possession of an assault weapon, and being a felon in possession of firearms. he contends that the trial court erred in (1) overruling his objections that the prosecutor had used peremptory challenges to excuse three prospective jurors based on their race, and (2) denying his motion for a new trial. defendant also asks us to examine whether the trial court erred in denying his motion to unseal the partially sealed search warrant affidavit in this case. none of these arguments has merit, and we affirm. factual and procedural background the charges in this case stem from the execution of a search warrant at a residence in lancaster. the odor of powder cocaine pervaded the residence. one of the residence inside this office, los angeles -47 style assault rifle loaded with 18 live rounds; a glass table bearing a plate with a white residue, a razor blade and knife, eight or nine boxes of baking soda, sandwich bags, digital scales, and a container of institol brick-shaped packages of cocaine, one of which had been opened, with a street value these items are commonly associated with the large-scale manufacture and sale of cocaine base. two other loaded gunsa nine-millimeter smith & wesson pistol with eigwere stuffed under the sofa cushions in the television room. only -year-old mother and an infant were inside the residence. however, there was evidence tying defendant to the residence: the office containing the cocaine, assault rifle, and cash also california identification card was found next to a live nine-millimeter round on a shelf in the master bedroom closet. 3 while the search being conducted, defendant was pulled over near the residence and arreste $96center console. in a subsequent, recorded interview, defendant stated that the residence belong to him and that his mother was not involved in any criminal activity. the people charged defendant with (1) possession for sale of a controlled substance (cocaine) (health & saf. code,  11351; count 1), (2) possession of a controlled substance while armed with a loaded firearm (health & saf. code,  11370.1, subd. (a); count 2), (3) possession of an assault weapon (pen. code,  30605, subd. (a); count 3),1 and (4) three counts of being a felon-in-possession of a firearm ( 29800, subd. (a); counts 4, 5, and 6.) the people also alleged that defendant was armed with an assault rifle while possessing cocaine for sale ( 12022, subd. (c)), had suffered two prior convictions for possession of a controlled substance (health & saf. code,  11370.2, subd. (a)), and had served a prior prison term ( 667.5, subd. (b)). the jury returned guilty verdicts on all counts and found true the accompanying firearm-use allegation. in bifurcated proceedings, defendant admitted his prior convictions and prison term. court imposed a prison sentence of 18 years. the court selected the possession of cocaine count as the principal count, and imposed the upper term of four years, and then added five years for the firearm-use enhancement, six years for the two prior drug convictions (three for each), and one year for the prior prison term. the court imposed consecutive terms of eight months each on the possession of an assault weapon count and on two of the three felon-in-possession counts, but stayed the sentence on the remaining counts under section 654. defendant timely appealed. 1 all further statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise indicated. 4 discussion i. jury selectionbatson/wheeler motions although a prosecutor may exercise a peremptory challenge to strike a prospective any reason, or no reason at allpeople v. scott (2015) 61 cal.4th 363, 387 (scott), quoting hernandez v. new york (1991) 500 u.s. 352, 374 (conc. opn. of )), he or she may not strike prospective jurors on the basis of group biasmembers of an identifiable group distinguished on racial, religious, ethnic, or similar grounds . . . (people v. bell (2007) 40 cal.4th 582, 596 (bell)). protection set forth in batson v. kentucky (1986) 476 u.s. 79 (batson) and his state right to a trial by a jury drawn from a representative cross-section of the community under article i, section 16 of the california constitution (people v. wheeler (1978) 22 cal.3d 258, 272 (wheeler).) a defendant bears the ultimate burden of showing a constitutional violation (people v. lenix (2008) 44 cal.4th 602, 612-613 (lenix)), but courts employ a three-step, burden-shifting mechanism in assessing whether a violation has occurred. the defendant gives rise to an inference of discriminatory purpose in the exercise of peremptory scott, supra, 61 cal.4th at p. 383.) if the trial court finds that the defendant basis (ibid.sincere and reasoned effort to evaluate the nondiscriminatory justificationspeople v. williams (2013) 56 cal.4th 630, 650 (williams)genuine or instead a pretext for discrimination. (scott, at p. 383; people v. duff (2014) 58 cal.4th 527, 548; people v. jones (2013) 57 cal.4th 899, 917 (jones)). 5 defendant argues that the trial court erred in rejecting his batson/wheeler consider each separately. a. prospective juror 6946 in response to questioning by the trial court, prospective juror 6946 indicated that she was a receptionist at a medical office; her father was a machine operator and her mother was a stay-at-home mom; she had a brother in college and a sister in elementary school; she lived in the antelope valley; and she had no prior jury duty experience. the prosecutor exercised two peremptory challenges on other jurors without defense objection. when the prosecutor exercised his third challenge against prospective juror 6946, defendant made a batson/wheeler objection. at a sidebar, defense counsel offered namely, african-american; and (2) the would be an unfair juror. the trial court expressed doubt that prospective juror 6946 was african-american (and indicated she might be asian-american), but ultimately ruled that defendant had not established a prima facie dismissal could not establish a prima facie case. wheeler/batson violation may occur with a single discriminatory people v. williams (2006) 40 cal.4th 287, 313 (williams)), the trial court erred in relying on a categorical rule that a solitary challenge cannot. however, our task ruling, not merely its reasoning. (fonteno v. wells fargo bank, n.a. (2014) 228 cal.app.4th 1358, 1365.) we must therefore assess for ourselves whether defendant made out a prima facie case, and do so de novo. (scott, supra, 61 cal.4th at p. 384 [de novo review applies where trial court applied the incorrect standard].) facie case depends on consideration of the entire record of voir dire at the time the [batson/wheeler have enumerated several factors to examine: (1) whether the prosecutor has struck most 6 or all members of the identifiable group to which the prospective juror belongs; (2) whether the prosecutor has used a disproportionate number of his peremptory strikes ther the defendant belongs to the same identifiable group as the juror; (5) whether the crime victim belongs the same identifiable group as a peremptory challenge . . (scott, supra, 61 cal.4th at p. 384; bell, supra, 40 cal.4th at p. 597; people v. taylor (2010) 48 cal.4th 574, 616.) in light of these factors, courts have noted that a prima facie bell, at p. 598; williams, supra, 40 cal.4th at p. wheeler/batson violation when comparative analysis raises questions as to a single prospect on the record before us, defendant did not establish a prima facie case of discrimination at the time the prosecutor exercised a peremptory challenge against ursory and the prosecutor did not ask any followup questions, most of the remaining factors counsel against an inference of discrimination: at the time of his challenge, the prosecutor had exercised two peremptory challenges but none of them had been used to excuse an african-american or asian-american juror; both the court and prosecutor questioned whether prospective juror 6946 was of the same race as defendant; and there was no crime victim. it is debatable whether a nondiscriminatory reason to excuse prospective juror 6946 is apparent from the record. but taken as a whole, the totality of these factors does not give rise to an inference of discriminatory purpose. (johnson v. california (2005) 545 u.s. 162, 168.) b. prospective juror 1250 prospective juror 1250 stated she was married with two children and was 7 assault case; that he was unhappy with the result of that case; and that she believed her son had been treated unfairly. the prosecutor exercised his fourth peremptory challenge against this juror. defendant made a batson/wheeler objection, arguing that she was the second african-american juror to be stricken. the trial court found that defendant had made out a prima facie case, and asked the prosecutor to state his reasons for the strike. the prosecutor gave two reasons: (1) which is similar to a social worker, which is a profession whose members are more likely to be forgiving and to give accused criminals the benefit of the doubt; and (2) prospective found these reasons to be race-neutral and overruled the objection. batson/wheeler analysis, reasoned effort to evaluate the nondiscriminatory justifications offered,great (williams, supra, 56 cal.4th at p. 650.) both reasons the prosecutor offered as to this juror are, under settled case law, nondiscriminatory. (see people v. clark (2011) 52 cal.4th 856, 908 -neutral basis for excusal]; jones, supracriminal justice system; race-neutral basis for excusal].) defendant argues that there is no proof that an eligibility worker is akin to a social worker, but the prosecutor thought so and our task is to evaluate the genuineness of his subjective reasons; moreover, the ctively unreasonable. c. prospective juror 5944 prospective juror 5944 stated that she was a medical auditor, was married to a postal employee, and had three children. she also indicated that one of her family members had been murdered five years prior, and felt that the criminal justice system was she also stated that she had prepaid tickets for a cruise that would depart in 13 days. after the prosecutor exercised 8 two more peremptory challenges without objection, the prosecutor used his seventh challenge to strike prospective juror 5944. the defense made a batson/wheeler objection, arguing that she was african-american. the trial court observed that the -neutral reason for the strike, but found that defendant had made a prima facie case. the prosecutor offered one further reason in responsenamely, that the juror would be distracted by her impending departure date. the court overruled the objection after finding the prosecuto-criminal justice system. both reasons are race-neutral. (see lenix, supra, 44 cal.4th at p. 628 -neutral basis for excusal]; clark, supra, 52 cal.4th at pp. 907--related training; race-neutral basis for excusal].) ii. new trial motion a defendant may move for a new trial following conviction. ( 1181.) in this case, defendant filed a pro se motion for a new trial due to ineffective assistance of counsel, a violation of his right to be present at an evidentiary hearing, and insufficiency of the evidence. the trial court denied the motion. we review for an abuse of discretion (people v. trinh (2014) 59 cal.4th 216, 249), and conclude there was no abuse. a. ineffective assistance of counsel decided in a habeas corpus proceeding rather than an appepromptly at the trial level. (people v. carrasco (2014) 59 cal.4th 924, 980-981, quoting people v. cornwell (2005) 37 cal.4th 50, 101.) to establish that trial counsel did not provide the effective assistance of counsel guaranteed by the sixth amendment, a standard of reasonableness, and (2) but for that ineffectiveness, it is reasonably probable that the outcome of the proceeding would have been different. (people v. brown (2014) 9 59 cal.4th 86, 109 (brown); see also strickland v. washington (1984) 466 u.s. 668.) to establish the first element, a defendant must overcome the general presumption that counsel acts competently. (brown, at p. 109.) defendant cites three alleged instances of deficient representation, and we consider each separately. 1. failure to obtain report from juvenile case file of defeson during the testimony of one of the s deputies who executed the search at deputy on the basis of statements the deputy had made to a social worker that were in a report contained in two grounds: (1) the report, as required by welfare and institutions code section 827; and (2) the questioning was properly excluded under evidence code section 352, because the consistent with his preliminary hearing testimony and the videotape of the search, while we need not decide whether trial counsel was deficient for not obtaining the e it is not reasonably probable that the result of the trial would have been different. the trial court indicated its intent to preclude any questioning using the report under evidence code section 352 (and that ruling would have been within its discretion). further, impeachment as to the precise location of the numerous guns, drugs, cash, and drug-given the pre-t those items still would have been in the house house was overwhelming. 2. -house confession under miranda v. arizona (1966) 384 u.s. 436, defendant argues that counsel was 10 ineffective for (1) not impeaching the testifying with his prior report as to whether he advised defendant of his miranda rights on the day of his arrest, and (2) not challenging the statement as the involuntary product of coercion and promises of leniency, in violation of due process. the first claim is without merit. during the suppression hearing, the deputy testified that he had not given defendant miranda warnings on the date of his arrest, but his police report indicated that he had. however, it is not reasonably probable that the defendant made the next day was admissible because that statement was preceded by miranda warnings. the second claim is also without merit. the due process clause bars the people v. weaver (2001) 26 cal.4th a confession is involuntary . . . if it was elicited by any promise of benefit or leniency whether express or implied.people v. holloway (2004) 33 cal.4th 96, 115 (holloway). police to arrest or punish a close relative, or a promise to free the relative in exchange for a confession, may [also] render people v. steger (1976) 16 cal.3d 539, 550.) however, it is not coercive for law enforcement to offer mere advice or extortion . . . that it would be better for the accused to tell the truthpeople v. dowdell (2014) 227 cal.app.4th 1388, flow[] naturally from a truthful and honest course of conductholloway, at p. 115); or to summarize the evidence against a defendant and confront him with contradictory facts (people v. carrington (2009) 47 cal.4th 145, 170). deputy, during the videotaped interview, pointed out that both defendant and his mother were living in the house full of cocaine and drugs; told opportun. defendant 11 the questioning in this case did not cross the line from permissible techniques to coercive tactics. the interviewing officer summarized the state of the evidence, pointed out the adverse consequences to defendant and mother that could flow from those facts, and asked defendant whether his mother was involved. contrary to what defendant urges, these questions did not amount to a threat to prosecute mother if defendant did not confess and also did not amount to a promise not to prosecute mother if defendant did confess. any violation was, in any event, harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because the sole fruit of that confessionwas overwhelmingly established by his identification documents found in the office with the guns, drugs and cash and with the live nine-millimeter ammunition; and by the large sum of cash in his car when he was arrested. (see people v. jablonski (2006) 37 cal.4th 774, 816-817 [applying chapman v. california (1967) 386 u.s. 18 standard in evaluating harmlessness of admission of involuntary statement].) 3. fafelon defendant further contends that defense counsel was ineffective for not moving to conviction and his familiarity with the criminal justice system, and (2) exclude a photograph of the letters found in the residence which listed a blythe prison address as stipulation to his prior conviction, which was read to the jury. counsel is not ineffective for failing to make meritless objections. (people v. torrez (1995) 31 cal.app.4th 1084, 1091.) b. a defendant charged with a felony has a nonwaivable right to be personally pre12 waivable right to be present at all other proceedings ( 977, subd. (c), 1043, subd. (a)). (see also people v. davis (2005) 36 cal.4th 510, 530 [noting constitutional right to be present] (davis).) defendant argues that this right was violated, and that he is entitled to a new trial under section 1181, subdivision (1), because he was not present during an evidence code section 402 hearing, on the afternoon of january 24, 2014, challenging the admission of his videotaped confession under miranda. this argument is not supported by the record. the transcript for the morning of january 24 indicates that defendant was not present when the trial court ordered a witness to return to trial. however, the section 402 hearing occurred in the afternoon. although the trial court did not state on the record who was present for the afternoon session, the prosecutor indicated that they would not have conducted a section 402 hearing unless defendant had been present. defendant has not established that he was absent. further, miranda, chapman or people v. watson (1956) 46 cal.2d 818, 836. (davis, supra, 36 cal.4th at pp. 532-533 [evaluating c. defendant lastly argues that the trial court erred in denying his new trial motion because there was insufficient evidence that he actually or constructively possessed the cocaine and firearms. in evaluating a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence in a new trial motion under s13and evaluates the evidence independently (porter v. superior court (2009) 47 cal.4th 125, 133)(people v. lewis (2001) 26 cal.4th 334, 364.) actually possesses them or if he constructively possesses them. (people v. thomas (2012) 53 cal.4th 1276, 13 people v. pena (1999) 74 cal.app.4th 1078, 1083-1084.) what is more, more than one person can constructively possess items at the same time. (people v. sifuentes (2011) 195 cal.app.4th 1410, 1417.) in this case, there was more than ample evidence that defendant constructively possessed the guns, drugs and money found in the residence. all of these items were identification cardmany in the same room as the drugs and ak-47. be imputed when the contraband is found in a place which is immediately and exclusively accessible to the accused and subject to his dominion and control, or to the joint dominion and control of the accused and anotherpeople v. williams (1971) 5 cal.3d 211, 215.) defendant protests that his 55-year-old mother and, on occasion, his girlfriend, lived in the house, but exclusive possession, as noted above, is not required. what is more, defendant admitted in his videotaped confession that the house was his. iii. affidavit when a defendant moves to suppress evidence obtained with a search warrant and the affidavit accompanying that warrant is wholly or partially filed under seal, the defendant may ask the trial court to conduct an in camera hearing at which (1) the court determines whether the sealed portions of the affidavit were properly sealed to protect tity (under evidence code section 1041), or other applicable privilege, of the affidavit were properly sealed, (2) the court decides, based on both the unsealed and sealed able probability that the people v. hobbs (1994) 7 cal.4th 948, 963, 972, 974-975 (hobbs); people v. heslington (2011) 195 cal.app.4th 947, 957-959 (heslington).) if the court concludes that thprivileged information (evid. code,  1042, subd. (b)), but must put the prosecutor to a 14 choice: disclose the information or accept a ruling suppressing the evidence. (hobbs, at pp. 974-975; heslington, at pp. 957-958 & fn. 7.) defendant has asked us to review the sealed portion of the affidavit and the transcript of the in camera hearing to determine whether the trial court properly followed these procedures and whether its ruling was correct. we have reviewed these items, and independently conclude that the court followed the above-stated procedures and properly declined to order disclosure of the sealed portions of the affidavit. disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. _______________________, j. hoffstadt we concur: ____________________________, p.j. boren ____________________________, j. ashmann-gerst
