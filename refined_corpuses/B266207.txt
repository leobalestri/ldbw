filed 2/7/17 p. v. session ca2/4 not to be published in the official reports california rules of court, rule 8.1115(a), prohibits courts and parties from citing or relying on opinions not certified for publication or ordered published, except as specified by rule 8.1115(b). this opinion has not been certified for publication or ordered published for purposes of rule 8.1115. in the court of appeal of the state of california second appellate district division four the people, plaintiff and respondent, v. davonte session et al., defendants and appellants. b266207 (los angeles county super. ct. no. pa081310) appeal from judgments of the superior court of los angeles county, david b. gelfound, judge. affirmed as modified. lynette gladd moore, under appointment by the court of appeal, for defendant and appellant davonte session. ava r. stralla, under appointment by the court of appeal, for defendant and appellant william leander jones. juliana drous, under appointment by the court of appeal, for defendant and appellant anisha johnson. 2 kamala d. harris, attorney general, gerald a. engler and lance e. winters, assistant attorneys general, jonathan m. krauss, wyatt e. bloomfield, and amanda lopez, deputy attorneys general, for plaintiff and respondent. ______________________________ in this gang-related drive-by-shooting case, davonte session, william leander jones, and anisha johnson appeal from the judgments entered upon their convictions by jury trial of shooting at an inhabited dwelling, assault with a semiautomatic firearm upon three individual victims, and carrying a loaded firearm while an active participant in a criminal street gang. in addition, session was convicted of possession of a firearm by a felon, and jones was convicted of possession of a firearm by a violent felon. both were convicted of being felons in possession of ammunition. appellants argue that under penal code section 6541 they may not be punished for both shooting at an inhabited dwelling and assaulting victims outside the dwelling. session and jones separately argue section 654 bars punishing them for both carrying a loaded firearm in a vehicle and being a felon in possession of a firearm. they also argue the sentence for carrying a loaded firearm may not be enhanced under section 186.22, subdivision (b)(1) because the offense already was elevated to felony status under subdivision (a) of the same statute. johnson separately argues her conviction for carrying a loaded firearm and the true finding on the gang enhancement are not supported by substantial evidence. we disagree with these arguments. 1 subsequent statutory references are to the penal code. 3 respondent concedes that section 654 bars separate punishments for possession of a firearm and possession of ammunition. we accept the concession and order the judgments as to session and jones modified to stay the sentence on counts 12 and 14 respectively. we shall affirm the judgments as modified. factual and procedural summary on july 20, 2014, michelle ventura and her mother dora palacios were outside a converted garage in pacoima where they lived. michelle was holding her infant daughter, mia. the garage was attached to the house . gutierrez was inside the house, and venturawas inside the garage. at trial, ventura testified that, at about 6:30 p.m., she noticed a brown car driven by a woman with red hair pass by. at least two men were in the car. ventura heard gunshots and ran into the house. gutierrez immediately gave chase in his green suv. a patrol officer saw a tan suv speed westbound on van nuys boulevard n a red light, but gutierrez stopped. he told the officer that shots had been fired at his house from the vehicle he was pursuing. the officer caught up with the tan suv and ordered appellants to exit. johnson, whose hair had been dyed bright red, was in seat. jones was in the front passenger seat, while session was in the back seat behind the driver. an underage girl wearing a bright red t-shirt was in the rear right passenger seat. two semiautomatic pistols were found in a compartment in the right rear passenger section of the suv. no live ammunition was found in the magazines or guns. 4 three casings were found in the street and two bullet fragments were found in the dri the casings and one of the bullet fragments were matched to the bullet holes were found in suv, in an rv parked in front of his house, in the garage door, and in a couch behind that door. session and jones were members of the pacoima piru bloods gang, a rival of the humphrey boys gang. the pacoima piru bloods were associated with the color red. gutierrez was a humphrey boys gang member, and his house in that gang territory was known to police for gang activity. the pacoima piru bloods and humphrey boys had been feuding over overlapping territory. appellants were charged with the attempted murder of palacios, ventura, gutierrez, and mia ( 664, 187; counts 1-4); shooting at an inhabited dwelling ( 246; count 5), assault with a semiautomatic firearm against the same four individuals ( 245, subd. (b); counts 6-9), and carrying a loaded firearm while an active participant in a criminal street gang ( 25850, subds. (a) & (c); count 10). session also was charged with possession of a firearm by a felon ( 29800, subd. (a)(1); count 11) and possession of ammunition by a felon ( 30305, subd. (a)(1); count 12). jones also was charged with possession of a firearm with a prior violent conviction ( 29900, subd. (a)(1); count 13) and possession of ammunition by a felon ( 30305, subd. (a)(1); count 14). all offenses were alleged to have been gang-related. ( 186.22, subd. (b)(1).) various firearm enhancement allegations were attached to counts 1 through 9, including allegations of personal use and discharge of a firearm by both session and jones, as well as general allegations as to all appellants use and 5 discharge of a firearm. ( 12022.5, 12022.53, subds. (b), (c) & (e)(1).) a prior strike conviction resulting in a prison term was alleged as to session and jones. ( 667, 667.5, 1170.12.) ventura was reluctant to testify, and her trial testimony differed somewhat from statements she had made after the shooting. at that time, she told police that gutierrez, her brother jay and her sister elizabeth had been outside at the time of the shooting, but at trial, she testified jay had been inside the converted garage and gutierrez had been inside the house. she did not mention elizabeth. ventura told police a brown car had passed by twice but at trial she testified she had seen it pass by only once. at trial, ventura insisted she had heard but not seen the shots fired, and she denied having said that she had seen a man seated in the back seat behind the driver and another man seated in the front passenger seat. she was impeached with her statements to police that she had seen a gun fired through the gun fired over the roof of the vehicle. gutierrez was uncooperative at trial. he denied having been at the house at the time of the shooting or having pursued appellants afterwards, and he claimed not to remember anything. one of the investigating offithe night of the shooting gutierrez had told her his house had been fired upon and his baby almost killed. occupants and a female driver, and claimed the shooter was the male in the back seat. the shooting because he told her he had seen the car drive by once or twice before shots were fired from that car. the jury acquitted appellants of attempted murder (counts 1-4) and assault against gutierrez (count 8). it convicted them as 6 charged on all other counts. the jury found the allegations that session personally had used and discharged a firearm, attached to counts 5, 6, 7, and 9, to be not true. all other enhancement allegations were found to be true. the prosecution conceded that of carrying a loaded firearm was not a strike, and session admitted the prior prison term allegation. jones admitted his prior strike. the court imposed an indeterminate term of 15 years to life in prison on count 5 as to each appellant; , the term was doubled to 30 years to life under the three strikes law. the firearm enhancements attached to this count were stayed. the determinate term as to jones was 55 years, 8 months. it consisted of a high term of 9 years on count 6, doubled under the three strikes law, and enhanced by 10 years for the firearm use and by 5 years for the felony prior, for a total of 33 years on the principal term. on counts 7 and 9, the court imposed one-third of the middle term of 6 years on count 7, doubled, plus one-third of the firearm enhancement, for a total of 7 years, 4 months on each count, to run consecutively. the court stayed the gang enhancements on counts 6, 7, and 9. on counts 10, 13, and 14, the court imposed three consecutive terms of 2 years, 8 months, each of which consisted of one-third of the mid-term for the substantive offense, or 8 months, doubled; and one-third of the gang enhancement, or 1 year, 4 months. the determinate term as to session was 24 years, 4 months. it consisted of a high term of 9 years on count 6, plus 5 years for the gang enhancement and 1 year for the prison prior, for a total of 15 years. on counts 7 and 9, the court imposed one-third of the middle term of 6 years, plus one-third of the gang enhancement, for a total of 3 years, 8 months on each count. the sentence on 7 count 10 consisted of one-third of the mid-term for the substantive offense, or 8 months, and one-third of the gang enhancement, or 16 months, for a total of 2 years. all these terms were to be served consecutively. the court imposed concurrent 5-year terms on counts 11 and 12, consisting of 2 years for the substantive offense and 3 years for the gang enhancement. the determinate term as to johnson was 8 years, consisting of the low term of 3 years on count 6, plus 5 years for the gang enhancement. the court imposed concurrent sentences on the remaining counts: 8-year terms on counts 7 and 9, and a 4-year term (2 years for the offense and another 2 years for the gang enhancement) on count 10. appellants received presentence credits and were assessed fines and fees. this appeal followed. discussion i appellants challenge portions of their sentences under section 654, which bars multiple punishment under different provisions of law for a single criminal act or indivisible course of conduct incident to a single objective. (people v. hicks (1993) 6 cal.4th 784, 789.) a. shooting at an inhabited dwelling appellants argue multiple punishment for shooting at an inhabited dwelling and assaulting the persons standing in front of it was improper under section 654. however, the multiple victim exception allows separate punishment for each crime of violence against a different victim, even though all crimes are part of an indivisible course of conduct with a single principal objective. (people v. felix (2009) 172 cal.app.4th 1618, 16301631.) 8 appellants claim there is no substantial evidence that anyone was inside the converted garage at which shots were directed. they rely on conflicting testimony as to the whereabouts . but under the substantial evidence test we view the evidence in favor of the prosecution and do not resolve conflicts in the testimony. (people v. zamudio (2008) 43 cal.4th 327, 357.) ventura had told police gutierrez and jay were in front of the house during the shooting, but at trial she explained they she testified jay was in the converted apartment, where on cross-examination, ventura answered affirmatively questions asking whether jay was in the house or the garage. session argues her answers mean that jay was in the main house, not in the garage. considered the converted garage to be their house. indeed, an attached garage is considered a room in a dwelling. (people v. morales (2008) 168 cal.app.4th 1075, 1081.) ventura also testified that gutierrez was in the main house at the time of the shooting, which may explain why the jury acquitted appellants of the assault charge against him. home was contradicted by his own statements to police after the shooting. were one or more victims of the shooting at an occupied dwelling who were not named in any other count for which appellants were convicted. (see people v. felix, supra, 172 cal.app.4th at pp. 16301631.) separate punishment on count 5 (shooting at an inhabited dwelling) was proper. 9 b. firearm possession session and jones argue they may not be punished for both carrying a loaded firearm and being a felon in possession of a firearm because possessing and carrying the firearms in the car were part of an indivisible course of conduct, incident to the drive-by shooting. an ex-felon may be separately punished for the and after a crime involving the use of that firearm. (see people v. ratcliff (1990) 223 cal.app.3d 1401, 1413.) the possession is complete once the intent to possess is perfected by possession. what the ex-felon does with the weapon later is another separate and distinct transaction undertaken with an additional intent which necessarily is something more than the mere intent to possess the id. at p. 1414; see also people v. jones (2002) 103 cal.app.4th 1139, 1147 [passenger who fired shots could be punished for actual or constructive possession of firearm while riding in car].) supported the conviction of session and jones for joint possession of the two firearms found in the car. (see people v. gant (1968) 264 cal.app.2d 420, 423 [defendants may be convicted of joint possession of firearm that is readily accessible to each defendant and in exclusive possession of neither].) there is substantial shooting. who put them there, or who acquired and possessed them beforehand is not material since it is inferable that session and jones had joint constructive possession of the two guns while riding in the car. (see people v. jones, supra, 103 cal.app.4th at p. 1147.) 10 section 654 allows multiple punishment under separate provisions of law for possessing more than one firearm. (people v. sanders (2012) 55 cthe holding of sanders to separate violations of the same statute is unavailing, as the court in that case explained the defendant could be punished for violations of two separate statutory provisionsformer sections 12021, subdivision (a)(1) (felon in possession) and 12021.1, subdivision (a) (violent felon in possession)based on his simultaneous possession of two firearms. (sanders, at p. 734.) court precedent does not require that we consider carrying and possessing multiple firearms to be an indivisible course of conduct incident to the same objective. in people v. jones (2012) 54 possessicourt overruled in re hayes (1969) 70 cal.2d 604, which had held that the single act of driving in violation of two different criminal statutes may be punished twice. (jones, at pp. 355358.) at the same time, however, the court quoted with approval chief justice separate acts of possession. (id. at p. 358, citing hayes, at p. 613 (dis. opn. of traynor, c. j.).) by this logic, carrying, and thus possessing, two firearms results in two punishable acts of possession, rather than in a single act or indivisible course of conduct. since session and jones committed multiple criminal acts, rather than a single act that violates multiple statutes, separate punishments on counts 10 (carrying a loaded firearm), 11 (felon in possession as to session) and 13 (violent felon in possession as to jones) were proper. 11 b. possession of ammunition respondent concedes that the sentence for possession of ammunition on counts 12 (session) and 14 (jones) must be stayed. punishment for possession of both a firearm and ammunition. (people v. lopez (2004) 119 cal.app.4th 132, 138.) here, the prosecution relied on a technicality to argue that possession of ammunition was divisible from the firearm possession. officer rood, who discovered the two pistols in they had no live ammunition inside the magazine or in the gun, in which the smaller of the two had the magazine inserted still into it, and the larger black steel had the magazine just inside of a magazine is included in the statutory definition of ammunition. ( 30305, subd. (a); 16150, subd. (b).) in its sentencing memorandum, the prosecution argued that [p]ossession of each weapon is a divisible act as is the possession of each magazine, particularly since one was apart from its magazines was not completely inserted into its corresponding weapon when found, other evidence indicates the gun had been fired during the shooting, which means the magazine at one point was completely loaded into the gun. thus, the evidence does not indicate the magazine was possessed separately from its corresponding firearm. people v. lopez, supra, 119 cal.app.4th 132 cannot be read to exclude from section 654 loosely loaded ammunition. we shall order the concurrent 5-year term on count 12 12 as to session and the consecutive term of 2 years, 8 months on count 14 as to jones stayed under section 654. ii session and jones argue the sentence for carrying a loaded firearm (count 10) may not be enhanced under section 186.22, subdivision (b)(1) because the firearm offense was elevated from a misdemeanor to a felony based on a finding of active gang participation under section 186.22, subdivision (a). they rely on cases declining to apply two gang-related penalty provisions to the same crime. we find those cases distinguishable. in people v. arroyas (2002) 96 cal.app.4th 1439, 1445 (arroyas), the court of appeal held that section 186.22, subdivision (d), which allows a misdemeanor committed for the benefit of a gang to be punished as a felony, may not be used to subdivision (b)(1) of that statute, which subjects a felony committed for the benefit of a gang to additional punishment. two years later, in people v. briceno (2004) 34 cal.4th 451, 465 (briceno), the supreme court held that section 1192.7, subdivision (c)(28), which defines a felony committed to benefit a gang as a serious felony, may not be used into section 186.22, subdivision (b)(1)(b), which subjects a serious felony committed for the benefit of a gang to increased punishment. the court noted it would be same gang-additional punishment. (briceno, at p. 465.) similarly, in lopez v. superior court (2008) 160 cal.app.4th 824, 832 (lopez), the court concluded that section 186.22, subdivision (d) may not be used to elevate contempt of court ( 166, subd. (a)(4)) to a felony based on violation of an i-13 injunction and the proof of a gang connection for the enhancing the provisions at issue in those cases (186.22, subd. (d) and  1192.7, subd. (c)(28)) had been enacted pursuant to the same voter initiative (prop. 21, as approved by voters, primary elec. (mar. 7, 2000)), and the courts concluded that in approving the initiative the voters had not intended to offenses committed for the benefit of a gang. (briceno, supra, 34 cal.4th at p. 465, quoting arroyas, supra, 96 cal.app.4th at p. 1445; see also lopez, supra, 160 cal.app.4th at p. 830.) in contrast, in people v. jones (2009) 47 cal.4th 566, 568569, the court found no problem in the application of both section 186.22, subdivision (b)(4), which subjects certain felonies committed for the benefit of a gang to life imprisonment, and section 12022.53, which imposes an enhancement for personally discharging a firearm in the commission of a felony punishable by life imprisonment. ( 12022.53, subds. (a)(17) & (c).) the court distinguished briceno, supra, 34 cal.4th 451 and arroyas, supra, 96 cal.app.4th 1439 because in those cases the courts considered penalties for committing a crime to benefit a criminal street gang, and each concluded that the california electorate, which enacted those provisions through an initiative measure, did not intend to jones, at p. 575.) in contrast, the provisions at issue in jones [ed] in separate provisions at issuesection 186.22[, subdivision] (b)(4)pertain[ed] jones, at p. 575.) 14 one of the provisions at issue in this case, section 25850, subdivision (c)(3), elevates carrying a loaded firearm to a felony on proof of all the elements of the crime of active gang participation in section 186.22, subdivision (a). (people v. robles (2000) 23 cal.4th 1106, 1115 (robles) [interpreting former  12031, subd. (a)(2)(c)]; people v. velasquez (2012) 211 cal.app.4th 1170, 1172 & fn. 2 [ 12031 was renumbered  25850].) section 25850, subdivision (c)(3) appears in a separate statutory scheme. while it punishes the offense of carrying a loaded firearm ( 25850, subd. (a)) as a felony by reference to a provision in the gang statute (186.22, subd. (a)), there is no evidence of legislative intent precluding application of subdivision (b)(1) of the same statute, which enhances the punishment for a felony committed for the benefit of a gang. (186.22, subd. (b)(1).) that is because section 186.22, subdivisions (a) and (b) use different language, have different elements, and punish different conduct. in summary, the crime of carrying a loaded firearm may become a felony by reason of conduct giving rise to another felony, which need not be gang related. (see people v. lamas (2007) 42 cal.4th 516, 524 (lamas); see also people v. albillar (2010) 51 cal.4th 47, 59 (albillar).) on the other hand, the crime of carrying a loaded firearm may be deemed gang related based on the conduct that gave rise to the crime itself, rather than to another crime. (see albillar, at p. 66.) thus, there is no necessary overlap between the conduct that elevates carrying a loaded firearm to felony status and that which subjects the resulting felony to additional punishment under the gang enhancement. more specifically, carrying a loaded firearm becomes a felony under section 25850, subdivision (c)(3) on proof of a violation of 15 section 186.22, subdivision (a), which prohibits active participation in a criminal street and willful promotion, furtherance or assistance criminal conduct by members of that g 186.22[,(robles, supra, 23 cal.4th at p. 1115.) misdemeanor conductbeing a gang member who carries a loaded firearm in publicfelonious conduct, and then be used to elevate the otherwise lamas, supra, 42 cal.4th at p. 524.) rather, carrying a loaded firearm becomes a felony only if completely satisfied by conduct distinct from the otherwise misdemeanor conduct of carrying a loaded weapon . . . . (lamas, at p. 524; see also people v. infante be established independently of  186.22, subd. (a) and former  12031].) thus, carrying a loaded firearm becomes a felony under section 25850, subdivision (c)(3) only because of the defendant participation in a separate felony. the jury in this case was instructed that felonious criminal conduct means ith a semiautomatic firearm or shooting at an inhabited dwelling, which comprised the conduct during the drive-by shooting that formed the basis for counts 1 through 9. the jury convicted appellants of shooting at an inhabited dwelling and three counts of assault with a semiautomatic firearm, and the conduct underlying those convictions elevated carrying a loaded firearm to felony status. felonious conduct may satisfy section 186.22, subdivision (a) even if it is not gang related under subdivision (b)(1). (albillar, supra, 51 cal.4th at p. 59.) therefore, there was no requirement 16 that the felonies committed during the drive-by shooting be gang related in order to elevate carrying a loaded firearm to a felony. section 186.22, subdivision (b)(1), on the other hand, requires that a felony be gang related in order to be subject to an additional enhancement. (albillar, at p. 60.) to be gang related, a felony association with any criminal street gang, with the specific intent to promote, further, or assist in any criminal conduct by gang but the conduct in question under subdivision (b)(1) criminal conduct underlying the offense . . . sought to be (albillar, at p. 66.) hence, the crime of carrying a loaded firearm may be deemed gang related without reference to any other criminal conduct. here, there was evidence that appellantstwo members and one associate of the pacoima piru bloods gangcarried loaded firearms in a vehicle into rival gang territory. the gang expert testified that appellants acted disrespect, and to assert and reestablish their dominance over a rival gang. that would have been sufficient to bring felony carrying a loaded firearm within section 186.22, subdivision (b)(1). (see, e.g., people v. leon (2008) 161 cal.app.4th 149, 155, 163 [evidence sufficient under  186.22, subd. (b)(1) to enhance carrying loaded firearm as active gang participant where defendant and his fellow gang member carried loaded firearm in rival gang territory]; in re frank s. (2006) 141 cal.app.4th 1192, did not present any evidence that the minor was in gang territory, had gang members with him, or had any reason to expect to use [a] knife in a gang- 17 the hypothetical posed to the expert was based on the entire incident, including the drive-by shooting and the presence , because gang enhancement allegations were attached to all counts. even so, the fact that the jury found all crimes to have been gang related does not mean the felonious conduct used to satisfy section 186.22, subdivisions (a) was a necessary element of the gang enhancement attached to the carrying a loaded firearm count under subdivision (b)(1). section 186.22, subdivisions (a) and (b)(1) overlap to the extent they reference the definition of criminal street gang under subdivision (f). the jury was instructed that all of crimes could be used to establish the pattern of criminal gang activity that defines a criminal street gang. but independent evidence of crimes committed by other members of the pacoima piru bloods was introduced to establish the required minimum of two predicate offenses under section 186.22, subdivision (e). thus, e drive-by shooting was not necessarily used to find that the pacoima piru bloods were a criminal street gang for purposes of the gang enhancement. appellants argue that, under people v. nguyen (2015) 61 cal.4th 1015, active gang participation may not be additionally punished under the gang enhancement in that case, the court accepted street terrorism under section 186.22, subdivision (a) is not itself subject to a sentence enhancement under subdivision (b)(1), since that enhancement attaches to the underlying felonious conduct, on which such a conviction is based. (nguyen, at p. 1068.) because appellants were not charged with a violation of section 186.22, subdivision (a), nguyen is inapposite. 18 session cites people v. flores (2005) 129 cal.app.4th 174, 184, which held that a defendant could not be convicted of both street terrorism in violation of section 186.22, subdivision (a), and carrying a loaded firearm as an active gang participant in violation of former section 12031, subdivision (a)(2)(c) because he could not have committed the latter offense without necessarily committing the former. the application of flores to this case is questionable since, in that case, the court accepted the attorney . (cf. people v. schoppe-rico (2006) 140 cal.app.4th 1370, 1383 street gang firearm statutes do not include a gang connection elementthe california supreme court has clarified that a sentencing enhancement or penalty provision is not an element of the substantive offense under california law, and the statutory elements test, rather than the accusatory pleading test, determines if a crime is a lesser included offense. (see people v. anderson (2009) 47 cal.4th 92, 119; people v. reed (2006) 38 cal.4th 1224, 1229.) carrying a loaded firearm in public is a crime under section 25850, subdivision (a). subdivision (c)(3) is one of several penalty offense is committed under specified circumstances. (robert l. v. superior court (2003) 30 cal.4th 894, 899 [interpreting  186.22, subd. (d) as a penalty provision].) a is separate from the underlying offense and does not set forth elements of the (ibid.) thus, active gang participation cannot be characterized as an element or a lesser included offense of the crime of carrying a loaded firearm. attaching a gang enhancement to the latter crime does not necessarily punish a defendant for the former. 19 because section 186.22, subdivisions (a) and (b) do not necessarily apply to the same conduct, application of the gang enhancement in subdivision (b) to count 10 was proper.2 iii johnson argues the evidence fails to support her conviction of carrying a loaded firearm in a vehicle or the life sentence imposed pursuant to section 186.22, subdivision (b)(4)(b). we review these arguments under the substantial evidence test. as we have explained, that test requires us to view the record and draw reasonable inferences in favor of the judgment. (people v. zamudio, supra, 43 cal.4th at p. 357.) a. constructive possession people v. sifuentes (2011) 195 cal.app.4th 1410 is misplaced. in that case, a gun was found under the mattress in a motel room the defendant occupied with another gang member and two women. the other gang member was kneeling close to where the gun was hidden, while the defendant was lying on another bed. (id. at p. 14131414.) there was no evidence that the defendant controlled the gun, and the court found insufficient evidence to support an inference that the gun was a jointly possessed . (id. at pp. 1417, 1419.) rent because she was the driver of the car in which weapons were discovered immediately after a drive-by shooting. there was evidence that shots had been fired of that car, and that the car had run a red light in a high-speed chase by one of the victims of the drive-by shooting. carrying a firearm in a vehicle may be 2 appellants do not argue that the sentence imposed on count 10 should have been stayed under section 654, and we express no view on the matter. 20 supported by circumstantial evidence of constructive possession. (people v. taylor (1984) 151 cal.app.3d 432, 436.) an inference of dominion and control arises when a firearm is carried in a vehicle driven by the defendant, particularly where the driver takes evasive action.
