(people v. kelly (2006) 40 cal.4th 106, 110, 124 (kelly).) in 2007, dajuan malcolm jackson repeatedly stabbed his girlfriend with a knife and was convicted of mayhem, assault with a deadly weapon, and inflicting corporal injury on a cohabitant. because he had prior strike convictions (related to shooting three victims), jackson was sentenced under three strikes law to a term of 34 years to life. following passage of proposition 36 (a statewide initiative approved on nov. 6, 2012 violent), jackson filed a petition seeking resentencing. the trial court denied the petition, because his current convictions are for violent felonies, which makes him ineligible for resentencing under penal code section 1170.126. -appointed counsel filed an opening brief requesting that this court independently review the record to determine whether there are any arguable issues on appeal. (wende, supra, 25 cal.3d at pp. 441442.) on september 14, 2015, we directed appointed counsel to immediately send the record on appeal and a copy of the opening brief to jackson and notified jackson that within 30 days from the date of the notice he could submit by letter or brief any ground of appeal, contention or argument he wishes us to consider. to date, we have received no response. we have examined the record in accordance with our obligations under wende, supra, 25 cal.3d at pages 436, 441. we are satisfied that jackson received adequate and effective appellate review of the judgment in this action, that his counsel fully complied with his responsibilities, and that no arguable issues exist.
