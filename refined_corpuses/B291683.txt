(b)). defendant did not appeal his sentence. on june 1, 2018, defendant filed a motion to modify his sentence. specifically, he asked the trial court to strike the three-year enhancement under section 11370.2 because senate 1 all further statutory references are to the health and safety code unless otherwise indicated. 2 defendant had sustained two prior drug convictionsa 2004 conviction for possessing a controlled substance for sale ( 11378) and a 2005 conviction for transporting a controlled substance ( 11379). however, it is unclear from the record which of the two prior convictions the court used as the basis for the enhancement. for purposes of this appeal, it does not matter. 3 bill 180 had amended section 11370.2 in a way that made it inapplicable to either of his prior drug convictions. conviction was final and because senate bill 180 was retroactively applicable to, at most, nonfinal convictions. defendant filed this timely appeal. discussion ecame final on december 15, 2014, which is the date on which his time to petition the united states supreme court for certiorari expired. (people v. grzymski (2018) 28 cal.app.5th 799, 805, review granted feb. 13, 2019, s252911.) senate bill 180 became law on october 11, 2017 (stats. 2017, ch. 677,  1), and became effective on january 1, 2018 (ibid.). as a 180 came about. conviction. intent that new penal laws apply only prospectively, not retroactively. (in re chavez (2004) 114 cal.app.4th 989, 993 (chavez) [so noting].) of course, this presumption regarding a legislative intent favoring prospective application of new penal laws may be rebutted. our legislature can expressly declare that a new law is retroactive, but it did not do so with respect to senate bill 180. (see people v. gray (2014) 58 cal.4th 901, 906 our supreme court has also crafted a relevant -namely, that our legislature presumptively intends to apply any mitigate[s] the penalty for a particular 4 nonfinal people v. brown (2012) 54 cal.4th 314, 324, italics added; in re estrada (1965) 63 cal.2d 740, 744-745.) but this counter-presumption does not aid defendant because his conviction was final by the time senate bill 180 was enacted and took effect. defendant offers two sets of arguments in response. first, he argues that our legislature evinced an intent to apply senate bill 180 retroactively because (1) senate bill 180 was aimed at reducing the prison population, and it would be more effective at doing so if applied retroactively to both nonfinal and final convictions, (2) making senate bill 180 fully retroactive to final convictions is permissible under the federal and california constitutions and by the above -chavez, supra, 114 cal.app.4th 989 supports making senate bill 180 applicable to final convictions. we reject these arguments. senate bill 180 advances our reduces sentences imposed after its effective date as well as to previously imposed sentences that are not yet final. (e.g., california teachers assn. v. governing bd. of rialto unified school dist. way that might maximipeople v. morales (2016) 63 cal.4th 399, 408), particularly where, as discussed below, there are countervailing reasons not to make senate bill 180 fully retroactive. what is more, the fact that our legislature could have made senate bill 180 fully retroactive does not shed light on whether it did. and chavez is inapt. chavez ruled that a 1993 amendment to a 1977 statute was retroactive to final 5 convictions because it was meant to fix a mistake in a 1983 amendment to the statute (chavez, at p. 998); chavez does not stand for the much broader proposition that all further amendments to statutes must be construed to be fully retroactive to final convictions. second, defendant argues that equal protection principles dictate that he receives the benefit of senate bill 180 to avoid being treated differently than defendants whose convictions are not yet final (or who have yet to be prosecuted). any reasonably conceivable state of facts that could provide a rational basis for the classification. people v. turnage (2012) 55 cal.4th 62, 74-75, quoting people v. wilkinson (2004) 33 cal.4th 821, 836 (wilkinson).) our supreme court has recognized that our legislature has a rational reason for refusing to make new laws that reduce criminal sentences fully retroactiveaws will maintain their desired deterrent effect by carrying out the original in re kapperman (1974) 11 [a] reduction of sentences only prospectively from the date a new sentencing statute takes effect people v. floyd (2003) 31 retroactivity cannot withstand strict scrutiny and cites people v. olivas (1976) 17 cal.3d 236, but our supreme court in wilkinson expressly clipped olivaswings and rejected the proposition that olivas . . . require[s] the courts to subject all criminal wilkinson, at p. 838.) 6 disposition the order is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. ________________________, j. hoffstadt we concur: ___________________________, p.j. lui ___________________________, j. chavez
