(b)(i); 1170.12) and sentenced defendant to a term of 25 years to life for the heroin possession offense. in january 2013, defendant filed his petition to recall his 1998 third strike sentence pursuant to proposition 36. 1 all further unspecified statutory references are to the penal code. 3 discussion i. proposition 47 the lower court, california voters passed proposition 47, which changed specified narcotics and theft-related offenses from felony offenses to misdemeanors.2 defendant contends the trial court abused its discretion in failing to apply its analysis of his proposition 36 petition. he further contends his counsel was ineffective for not making this argument to the court. a. background in november 2012, california voters passed proposition 36, which modified the three strikes law to permit 25-year-to-life sentences in most cases only when the third or subsequent felony conviction is for a serious or violent felony. the proposition permits defendants previously sentenced to 25 years to life for a nonserious, nonviolent third felony conviction to petition for recall of their sentences. an eligible defendant is entitled to resentencing [defendant] would pose an ( 1170.126, subd. (f).) proposition 36 does not provide a further definition of court, in exercising its discretion, may considehistory, his disciplinary and rehabilitation record while incarcerated and any other relevant evidence. ( 1170.126, subd. (g).) in november 2014, california voters passed proposition 47 which changed specified narcotics and theft-related offenses from felony offenses to 2 possession of heroin in state prison in violation of section 4573.6 is not one of those offenses. 4 misdemeanors. that proposition also provides that an eligible defendant is resentencing the [defendant] would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to ( 1170.18, subd. (b).) proposition 47, however, specifies that means an unreasonable risk that the petitioner will commit a new violent felony within the meaning of clause (iv) of subparagraph (c) of paragraph (2) ( 1170.18, subd. (c).) soon after the passage of proposition 47, courts began considering unreasonable risk of danger to public the california supreme court. (people v. chaney (2014) 231 cal.app.4th 1391, review granted feb. 18, 2015, s223676; people v. valencia (2014) 232 cal.app.4th 514, review granted feb. 18, 2015, s223825.) b. analysis filed under proposition 36. (see people v. esparza (2015) 242 cal.app.4th 726, 736-737 (esparza), abrogated by people v. cordova (2016) 248 cal.app.4th 543, 552, fn. 8, review granted aug. 31, 2016, s236179.) as the court in esparza matter of however, such a literal construction is not to be adopted if it conflicts with the voters intent shown in the official ballot pamphlet. [citations.] nothing in the official ballot pamphlet for proposition 47 hints at any impact on the procedure for resentencing three strike 5 esparza, supra, 242 cal.app.4th at p. 736.) defendant has not shown such an intent. with an intent to apply its definition of risk to proposition 36. proposition 36 gave defendants two years from its enactment to file their petitions for resentencing.3 ( 1170.126, subd. (b).) proposition 47 was enacted two days before that deadline. ( 1170.18.) nearly all proposition 36 petitions would have been filed, and many adjudicated by the time proposition 47 passed. it is unlikely that any rational voter would have intended to change the rules for proposition 36 at such a late date. ii. ineffective assistance of counsel chaney and valencia. there is nothing to indicate that counsel argued for such an application at the june 2015 suitability hearing. risk applied to proposition 36 did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel. in order to establish such a claim, defendant must show that his counsels performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness, and that, but for counsels error, a different result would have been reasonably probable. (strickland v. washington (1984) 466 u.s. 668, 687-688, 694; people v. ledesma (1987) 43 cal.3d 171, 216-218.) 3 petitions may be filed after two years, but only upon a showing of good cause. ( 1170,126. subd. (b).) 6 apply to proposition 36 petitions. a defense counsel is not required to make people v. ochoa (1998) 19 cal.4th 353, 432 [counsel is not deficient for failing to make a meritless motion to exclude].) clearly, there is no reasonable probability of a different outcome if counsel makes such an unmeritorious argument. iii. sition 36 petition definition of risk, the trial court abused its discretion in finding that he posed a serious risk of danger to public safety. defendant asserts the trial court did a. law esparza, supra, 242 cal.app.4th at p. 735.) the proposition specifies that, in determining if a defendant poses an s criminal conviction history, including the type of crimes committed, the extent of injury to victims, the length of prior prison commitments, and the remoteness of the crimes; [] (2) the petitioners disciplinary record and record of rehabilitation while incarcerated; and [] (3) any other evidence the court, within its discretion, determines to be relevant in deciding whether a new sentence would result in an unreasonable risk of danger to public ).) reasonable doubt to a jury. (people v. superior court (kaulick) (2013) 215 7 cal.app.4th 1279, 1303.) the proper standard of proof is a preponderance of the evidence. (id. at p. 1305.) defendant demonarbitrary, capricious or patently absurd manner that resulted in a manifest people v. rodrigues (1994) 8 cal.4th 1060, 1124-1125.) b. ruling the trial court issued a 15-page memorandum of decision explaining its lengthy criminal history, which dates back to 1978, behavior while in prison for the commitment offense. the court also abuse prevention, vocational, school or work programs; and his inadequate post-release plans. in addition, the court considered a number of mitigating factor defendant was convicted of possession of a controlled substance in 1978 or 1979, 1980 and 1983. in 1986, he was convicted of robbery; a co-perpetrator in the robbery had a firearm. he was committed to the california rehabilitation center and ultimately discharged in 1992. that same year, he was again convicted of possession of a controlled substance. in 1993, while on probation, he was convicted of second degree burglary of a school. he was released on parole and violated his parole several times. in 1995, while on parole, defendant was convicted of three counts of robbery, being a felon in possession of a firearm and evading a peace officer. while in prison in 1998, he was convicted of the current offense of possession of heroin 8 which defendant swallowed. prison officials were required to obtain a court order for a laxative to force defendant to pass the balloons. defendant received nine disciplinary serious rules violations (rvr) possession, one for possession of drug paraphernalia and one for distribution of drugs. the 2006 rvr for distributioswallowing seven balloons of heroin weighing 13.5 grams. four additional weapon on a fellow inmate. ral lack of preparation for his post-release life. defendant did not have any satisfactory or better performance in work, school or vocational training. he did not provide the court with any post-release plans. the court recognized that defendant had a drug addiction, but also in a controlled environment with programs available to assist him with his pointed out that defendant had not engaged in any self-help or programming while in prison to overcome his drug addiction. the court found defendant had not shown that he had learned to control his drug addiction. turning to mitigating factors, the court recognized that defendant 9 had not provided the court with any supporting evidence concerning his specific medical conditions. thus, this was a weak mitigating factor at best. the court also noted that defendant entered prison with a classification score of 90, which increased to 126 by 2007 and declined to 106 by may 2012. the lack of . it would have declined more rapidly if he had achieved satisfactory ratings in work, school or vocational training. the court found that rehabilitative programming, lack of re-entry plans, and other relevant factors support a finding that resentencing [defendant], at this time, would pose an unreason c. analysis according to defendant, the trial court failed to consider that the entire sentencing landscape has altered dramatically since defendant received his third strike sentence and so erroneously relied on an outdated definition of risk which included property crimes. he further contends the court cited inapplicable and inappropriate parole cases. 1. definition of risk defendant maintains that proposition 36 requires a risk of danger to cal safety, not merely of danger to property. he claims the not contemplate merely the absence of violent acts, it also includes the absence of property crimes. (see people v. nasalga (1996) 12 cal.4th 784, 790 10 enhance the penalties for the crimes of vehicle theft and receiving stolen 4 california law recognizes a wide variety of property crimes, ranging from petty theft and shoplifting to robbery and carjacking. some property crimes such as robbery, carjacking, and residential burglary carry the risk of violence. even after the sentencing reforms of the past decade, robbery remains a violent felony which as a third strike conviction triggers a 25-year-to-life sentence. ( 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(c), 667.5. subd.(c)(9).) thus, the armed robberies committed by defendant in the past are a far cry from snatching a slice of pizza. nasalga acknowledgement that defendant was not likely to be violent if released. we do nasalga and property crimes as being a prediction that defendant would commit only nonviolent property convictions involved the use of a firearm and his burglary involved extensive property damage to a school. thus, the fact of his prior convictions do show that defendant was willing to use violence to obtain property, even if he did not ultimately inflict violence. 2. parole defendant contends the trial court relied inappropriately on parole review cases in deciding his petition. some reference to parole review cases is appropriate in proposition 36 s decision to refuse to resentence a prisoner, based on a finding of dangerousness, is somewhat akin to a decision denying an inmate 4 the court is quoting from in re pedro t. (1994) 8 cal.4th 1041, a case which considered a temporary increase in punishment for vehicle-related theft. (people v. nasalga, supra, 12 cal.4th at p. 790.) 11 parolekaulick, supra, 215 cal.app.4th at p. 1306, fn. 29.) thus, parole decision under proposition 36. (see esparza, supra, 242 cal.app.4th at pp. 745-746 [discussing in re shaputis (2008) 44 cal.4th 1241 and in re lawrence (2008) 44 cal.4th 1181, both parole cases].) defendant complains generally that parole decisions apply a different standard of proof and require a more deferential standard of review than do proposition 36 resentencing decisions. the trial court clearly set out the appropriate standard of proof and standard of review for proposition 36 decisions in its memorandum of decision. he points to nothing suggesting that the trial court incorrectly applied the lower and less deferential standards for parole hearings to its proposition 36 decision. defendant complains of only two specific cases cited by the trial court, in re rozzo (2009) 172 cal.app.4th 40 and in re bettencourt (2007) 156 simply a small-time robber. the court cited those cases for the general -breaking and are general rule 5 5 the specific danger to public safety posed by an inmate does depend on the natucrimes and rules violations. nothing in the record remotely suggests the trial court viewed defendant as the equivalent of a dangerous murderer. 12 3. nexus defendant characterizes himself as an aging addict and contends there is no rational nexus between his past crimes and what he is likely to do if released pursuant to proposition 36. he contends the trial court abused its discretion in finding there is such a nexus. the court correctly recognized that a history of recidivism and even an inability to refrain from re-offending while in the community or incarcerated were not sufficient, standing alone, to prove current dangerousness. the trial court found, however, that his lack of participation in substance abuse programs or any vocational programs while in prison, together with his inadequate plans for re-entry into society, provided a link between his criminal past and current dangerousness. defendant has a long history of drug abuse and addiction and has been unable or unwilling to control or overcome his addiction, which was so severe that on two occasions he swallowed a large quantity of heroin with no regard for his own safety. as the trial court found, even assuming that defendant had refrained from using drugs since his last drug-related rvr in 2006, more arn to avoid the triggers that lead to relapse and avoid situations and behaviors substance abuse programs while in prison, there is no basis to conclude that he has learned appropriate behaviors. he remains at risk for a relapse into drug abuse if released, a risk that is heightened by his lack of post-release plans. a relapse would increase his risk of theft-related crimes to pay for his drugs. the trial court correctly considered all the evidence relevant to a 13 as age and health. the court did not abuse its discretion in finding that defendant would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety if resentenced under proposition 36. disposition not to be published in the official reports. goodman, j.* we concur: ashmann-gerst, acting p.j. hoffstadt, j. * retired judge of the los angeles superior court assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
