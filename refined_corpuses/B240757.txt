(a)). appellant was sentenced to the agreed upon term of nine years in state prison. the trial court imposed a $40 court operations assessment (pen. code  1465.8, subd. (a)), a restitution fine (pen. code  1202.4, subd. (b)), a parole revocation fine ( 1202.45), a $30 criminal conviction assessment ( 70373), and a $20 dna fine ( 76104.7). appellant filed a timely appeal. discussion appellant contends the trial court erred in imposing the $20 dna fine under section 76104.7 because that fine may be imposed only if the trial court also imposed a dna fine under section 76104.6. (people v. valencia (2008) 166 cal.app.4th 1392, 1395.) the people admit the trial court did not impose a dna fine under section 76104.6, and concede the record cannot support the imposition of such a fine on appeal. the people request this court strike the fine. accordingly, we will remand with instructions to strike the $20 dna fine. 1 all further statutory citations are to the government code, unless otherwise indicated. 3 disposition the order directing defendant to pay a $20 dna fine pursuant to government code section 76104.7 is stricken. as modified, the judgment is affirmed. the clerk of the superior court is directed to prepare and forward a corrected abstract of judgment to the department of corrections and rehabilitation. not to be published in the official reports. manella, j. we concur: willhite, acting p. j. suzukawa, j.
