(a)(1)(c), count 9).5 shortly after the amended information was filed, calderon requested substitution of counsel pursuant to people v. marsden (1970) 2 cal.3d 118. at a hearing conducted outside the d her efforts to develop a defense in the case.6 counsel explained she had 3 we discuss the idetail post. 4 all further undesignated statutory references are to the penal code. 5 pursuant to section 995, to dismiss count 8, aggravated sexual assault. 6 because calderon asserts an ineffective assistance claim, for purposes of this appeal the attorney-client privilege does not apply with respect to the facts he has placed at issue. (people v. ledesma (2006) 39 cal.4th 641, 691692; people v. dennis (1986) 177 cal.app.3d 863, 873; in re gray (1981) 123 cal.app.3d 614, 4 and had gone over it with him. she had consulted an expert, who reviewed an audiotape of the confession and concluded the confession was voluntary. she consulted with an attorney at the conversations with him, she concluded it was unlikely the confession would be excluded based on a miranda violation. nonetheless, counsel intended to litigate the validity of the confession vigorously. counsel also stated that a defense investigator had interviewed the victim and concluded she was trial counsel described, at the marsden hearing and at a subsequent appearance, the progress of plea negotiations in the case. the people had initially made offers of 18 and 19 years, similar cases, the people typically offered between 33 and 40 years. just before trial, calderon informed trial counsel that he wanted to accept the 18-year offer. the deputy district attorney the jury was coming supervisor, the deputy district attorney successfully restored the prior offer, with the provision ed the deal. after being advised of and waiving his rights ancounts, continuous sexual abuse of a child ( 288.5, subd.

(a)(1)(c)), in exchange for an 18-year term. 3. new trial motion 7 motion counsel argued that trial counsel had provided ineffective assistance by failing to move to suppress calderonprior to his plea, and by failing to tell calderon that there was a had calderon known his confession could be excluded at trial, he would not have pled guilty. as discussed post, in support of the motion calderon offered his own declaration, as well as declarations from motion counsel and a spanish language interpreter. the trial court denied the motion to withdraw the plea, finding it was not supported by good cause. the court found calderon had failed to establish the prejudice component of his ineffective assistance claim. it reasoned that, based upon the calderon had been facing 120 years to life, but trial counsel negotiated an 18-year term, which the court found to be a 8 7 for ease of reference, we hereinafter sometimes refer to the attorney who represented calderon through the plea proceedings 8 e court did not explicitly or impliedly hold that a suppression motion would have had merit. it based its denial of the motion to 6 4. sentencing the trial court sentenced calderon, in accordance with the negotiated disposition, to a term of 18 years in prison. it imposed a restitution fine, a suspended parole revocation restitution fine, a court security fee, and a criminal conviction fee. it dismissed the remaining counts. calderon obtained a certificate of probable cause and timely appealed. discussion calderon contends the trial court abused its discretion by denying his motion to withdraw his plea. he urges that his trial counsel failed to investigate the admissibility of his interview statements and did not advise him that the statements could have been suppressed. had he been aware of this circumstance, he would not have pled guilty. therefore, he contends, his plea was based on mistake and ignorance and was involuntary, and he should have been permitted to withdraw it. 1. forfeiture calderon has forfeited his right to argue the confession was involuntary or the interview violated miranda. the people rely on the principle that after entering a plea, a defendant may not attack the sufficiency or admissibility of the evidence. (see people v. thurman (2007) 157 cal.app.4th 36, 43 [a guilty plea concedes that the prosecution possesses legally admissible withdraw the plea on the fact calderon failed to establish the prejudice component of his ineffective assistance claim. (see strickland v. washington (1984) 466 u.s. 668, 697 [if it is easier to dispose of an ineffective assistance claim on the ground of lack of prejudice, that course should be followed]; in re cox (2003) 30 cal.4th 974, 10191020.) 7 evidence sufficient to prove guilt, and waives any right to challenge sufficiency or admissibility of the evidence].) in support of their forfeiture claim, the people point to, inter alia, people v. devaughn (1977) 18 cal.3d 889. there, the defendants pled guilty after the trial court denied motions to suppress their confessions. the trial court issued a certificate of probable cause purporting to preserve the denial of the suppression motions as an issue cognizable on appeal. (id. at p. 893.) however, appellate review of the ruling was waived by the guilty plea, and could not be restored by a certificate of probable cause, even though the confessions should have been suppressed. (ibid.; see people v. shults (1984) 151 cal.app.3d 714, 720.) devaughn explained: plea, an extrajudicial statement relating to his guilt of a charged crime does not, by reason of a claim that it was involuntarily or improperly induced, raise an issue on appeal based on legalidevaughn, at that the plea as distinguished from an extrajudicial statement was improperly induced would challenge the legality of the proceedings resulting in the plea and would thus be cognizable on ibid.) the defendants therefore could not claim on appeal that their confessions were involuntary, but could argue their pleas were improperly induced. (ibid.) here, the he is not challenging a pre-plea ruling on a motion to suppress; indeed, his complaint is that no such motion was ever made. he does not contend the plea is invalid because it was unsupported 8 by legally admissible evidence. instead, his theory is that the purportedly deficient performance, that the confession could have been excluded. this is the sort of contention that devaughn found was not forfeited by a plea. 2. calderon has failed to establish that his counsel provided ineffective assistance or that his plea was based on mistake or ignorance (a) applicable legal principles ( 1018.) exercise of free judgment is good cause for withdrawal of a guilty justic people v. patterson (2017) 2 cal.5th 885, 894; people v. alexander (2015) 233 cal.app.4th 313, 318.) a defendant who wishes to withdraw his plea has the burden to show, by clear and convincing evidence, that there is good cause for withdrawal. (ibid; people v. breslin (2012) 205 cal.app.4th 1409, 14151416.) a plea may not be withdrawn simply because the defendant has changed his or her mind. (people v. breslin, at p. 1416; people v. archer ng on a motion to withdraw a plea under section 1018 is reviewed for abuse of discretion. (people v. patterson, at p. 894; people v. hunt factual findings if supported by substantial evidence. (people v. fairbank (1997) 16 cal.4th 1223, 1254; people v. archer, at 9 p. 702.) guilty pleas should not be set aside lightly. (people v. archer, at p. 702; people v. hunt, at p. 103.) a defendant is entitled to the effective assistance of counsel during plea negotiations. (lafler v. cooper (2012) 566 u.s. 156, 165; in re alvernaz (1992) 2 cal.4th 924, 933; in re vargas (2000) 83 cal.app.4th 1125, 1133.) defense counsel is obliged to investigate the legal and factual bases for potential defenses, and make appropriate motions where a diligent and conscientious advocate would do so. (in re vargas, at p. 1133; people v. maguire (1998) 67 cal.app.4th 1022, 1028; people v. gonzalez (1998) 64 cal.app.4th 432, 437.) where ineffective assistance an opportunity to withdraw his plea. (in re vargas, at p. 1134; people v. maguire, at p. 1028.) people v. acosta (2018) 28 cal.app.5th 701, 706.) performance was deficient, and that he or she suffered prejudice as a result. (people v. mikel (2016) 2 cal.5th 181, 198; strickland v. washington, supra, 466 u.s. at p. 687; people v. acosta, at p. 706.) if the defendant makes an insufficient showing on either one of these components, the claim fails. (people v. holt (1997) 15 cal.4th 619, 703.) to establish prejudice in regard to a plea, the defendant must establish not only incompetent performance by incompetence, he or she would not have pled and would have insisted on proceeding to trial. (in re alvernaz, supra, 2 cal.4th at p. 934; people v. dillard (2017) 8 cal.app.5th 657, 668; people v. breslin, supra, 205 cal.app.4th at pp. 1416, 1418.) 10 (b) was deficient, or that he was unaware suppression was an issue key premises: first, trial counsel failed to sufficiently investigate the possibility his confession could be suppressed; second, the confession was clearly excludable; and third, had he known the confession could be excluded, he would not have pled. cabecause none of these premises is borne out by the record. 1. counsel diligently investigated the record does not demonstrate that defense counsel failed to investigate either the facts or the law in the manner required of a reasonably competent attorney. the record shows that counsel identified the miranda issue and took pains to evaluate it thoroughly. according to her statements at the marsden hearing, counsel went over the transcript of the confession with appellant, reviewed it herself multiple times, consulted with a confessions expert, consulted with an appellate based on these efforts, she concluded suppression was unlikely, but nonetheless intended to vigorously advocate for suppression prior to trial through motions in limine. although the expert concluded the confession was voluntary, counsel was considering calling him at trial to testify to the reasons people make false confessions. thus, the record does not 11 with the confession. to the contrary simply ignore the record.9 2. calderon was aware of the suppression issue nor does the record suggest calderon was in the dark about the possibility of suppression. calderon was present at the marsden hearing when trial counsel detailed her investigation into, and efforts regarding, the possibility of suppression. he therefore woalso at the marsden hearing, the court inquired whether trial your miranda violation as [the basis for] a possible [evidence code section] 402, have. . . . the court then asked calderon: has done to try to get ready in this case. she said that she has told you those things. is she mistaken? did you not know about calderon did not reply. and, in his declaration filed was advised by [trial counsel] that she had an expert on confessions who reviewed the interview with the detective . . . . clearly, calderon was aware of the suppression issue. 9 in support of his motion to withdraw the plea below, calderon offered a declaration from motion counsel, stating that memoranda on the subject, or a draft motion to suppress. but marsden hearing demonstrated her familiarity with the issues and efforts to pursue suppression. the absence of written notes or memoranda on the subject does not demonstrate otherwise. 12 3. trial counsel did not err by concluding suppression was unlikely incorrectly led him to believe suppression was unlikely, we discern no deficient performance. miranda and involuntariness claims are not as strong as he suggests. calderon complains that the confession should have been suppressed for four reasons: (1) it was involuntary because it was induced by false promises of leniency; (2) the miranda advisements provided were defective because detective valasi,10 who interviewed calderon, mispronounced some spanish words, rendering some of the warnings unclear; (3) valasi failed to honor (4) valasi failed to adequately advise calderon he was entitled to an attorney free of cost when he expressed confusion about the issue. (i) voluntariness when interviewing calderon, detective valasi stated that had investigated similar cases for ten years, and had spoken to they are ve , but she did not believe calderon was such a person. calderon valasi reiterated that she knew when a person was telling the truth or lying. m. had told valasi what happened, and valasi believed her, because m. had no reason to lie. valasi said: 10 13 se you are very important to her mother . . . and family a place to stay when they did not have one. valasi said calderon denied forcefully touching m. valasi said she wanted the truth, because god is perfect; and many people make mistakes. after calderon made an equivocal reference to counsel (discussed post), valasi said she wanted to give calderon the chance or opportunity to tell her what happened. make mist that she did not want him to be that charges we are not persuaded. whether express or implied, is involuntary and therefore inadmissible, but merely advising a suspect that it would be better to tell the truth, when unaccompanied by either a threat or (people v. davis (2009) 46 cal.4th 539, 600; people v. tully (2012) 54 cal.4th 952, 993; people v. holloway (2004) 33 cal.4th 96, 115.) strained. the detective made no explicit promises of lenience. 14 we have reviewed the interview transcript and conclude that no reasonable person would infer an implied promise, either. nothing about the challenged statements remotely suggested calderon might go home, have charges dropped, or receive any other benefit if he admitted the molestation. (see people v. carrington (2009) 47 cal.4th 145, 174 [statements that officer that full cooperation might be beneficial in some unspecified way, were not coercive]; people v. falaniko (2016) 1 cal.app.5th 1234, 1250 [officers may freely encourage honesty]; people v. holloway, supra, 33 cal.4th at p. 116 [suggestion that, if killings were accidental, this circumstance could make a lot of difference, fell declaration offered in support of his motion stated he believed the obliged to credit this self-serving statement. (see people v. dillard, supra, 8 cal.app.4th at p. 665 [in ruling on motion to credibility and his interest in the outcome of the proceedings].) (ii) adequacy of the miranda advisements calderon contends his confession was inadmissible because detective valasi failed to advise him of his rights as required by miranda. a custodial interrogation must be preceded by miranda waiver of them. (florida v. powell (2010) 559 u.s. 50, 59; people v. elizalde (2015) 61 cal.4th 523, 530; people v. dykes (2009) 46 cal.4th 731, 751.) miranda prescribed the following four now-familiar warnings: [] . . . any questioning [1] that he has the right to remain silent, [2] that 15 anything he says can be used against him in a court of law, [3] that he has the right to the presence of an attorney, and [4] that if he cannot afford an attorney one will be appointed for him prior to any questioninflorida v. powell, at pp. 5960; miranda, supra, 384 u.s. at p. 479.) a miranda rights -in-chief. (people v. jackson (2016) 1 cal.5th 269, 339; people v. peevy (1998) 17 cal.4th 1184, 1196.) here, detective valasi initially gave all four required warnings. according to the translated transcript of the r calderon argues that two of the advisements were inadequate because valasi failed to use the precise language of miranda, i.e., that anything he said could be used against him in a court of law, and that if he could not afford an attorney, one would be appointed for him prior to questioning. in his motion below, calderon presented declarations signed under penalty of perjury from nancy moyna, a licensed and court certified spanish language interpreter, who listened to the audio recording of the interview. pronunciation of some of the words, regarding the 16 urt give you one before miranda people v. wash (1993) 6 cal.4th 215, 236; california v. prysock (1981) 453 u.s. 355, 359.) miranda protected by the constitution but [are] instead measures to insure that the right against compulsory self-incrimination [is] examine miranda warnings as if construing a will or defining the terms of an easement. the inquiry is simply whether the required by miranda.duckworth v. eagan (1989) 492 u.s. 195, 203; florida v. powell, supra, 559 u.s. at p. 60; people v. wash, at pp. 236237.) mirandathe key points, as described by moynathat whatever calderon said might be used against him in court, and that the court would were at least arguably sufficient. as defense counsel reasonably concluded, the (see people v. marquez (1992) 1 cal.4th 553, 570571.) furthermore, at the outset of the interview, valasi advised that understand let me 17 yet calderon never asked for clarification or suggested he did not understand her words. moreover, much of the uncertainty regarding what valasi actually said appears to arise from the fact that portions of the recording were unintelligible. had counsel brought a suppression motion, valasi might have testified, leaving open the possibility that she might have explained that her words more closely matched the miranda language. united states v. botello-rosales (9th cir. 2013) 728 f.3d 865, is unavailing. there, a detective advised you have the right. one, wh(id. at p. 867.) this warning was insufficient, the ninth circuit ibid.) the phrasing suggested the right to appointed counsel was contingent on the ibid.) witness, you one before we tal this more clearly conveyed the right to appointed counsel than did the language at issue in botello-rosales. (iii) invocation of the right to counsel calderon next argues that he requested an attorney during the interview and detective valasi failed to honor his request. after valasi told calderon that she believed m., that she wanted calderon to tell her the truth, and that people make mistakes, the following exchange transpired: sk you for a favor? 18 whether i have the right to have an attorney here with me, want an attorney to? [overlapping voices] i an attorney here when we talk mhm. you can have an attorney here. because as i said: there are two stories, her story and your story. i, we know that something did happen, i know that. i want to give you that, uh, the chance, what do you call it? do you know what a chance is? yes, yes. a chance. a, yes. eron]: an opportunity. 19 an opportunity to tell me what happened withwhat happened. okay, so, we can talk or we can talk to aif you want an attorney, you can have an attorney. what do you want to do? k. yes. do you remember i read you those . . . deron]: no. . . . your rights? do you remember i read your rights and all the stuff? [overlapping voices, unintelligible] so do you want to talk to me? what happened? no miranda violation occurred here, because calderon did waives his right to counsel after receiving miranda warnings, police officers are free to question him. [citation.] if, postwaiver, a defendant requests counsel, the officers must cease further questioning until a lawyer has been made available or the defendant reinitiates. [citation.] however, the request for clearly that a reasonable police officer in the circumstances would biguous 20 circumstances would have understood only that the suspect might be invoking the right to counsel, [precedent does] not people v. shamblin (2015) 236 cal.app.4th 1, 19; davis v. united states (1994) 512 u.s. 452, 459; people v. cunningham (2015) 61 cal.4th 609, 646; people v. bacon (2010) 50 cal.4th 1082, interrupt an interrogation to ask clarifying questions following a (people v. cunningham, at p. 646; people v. williams (2010) 49 cal.4th 405, 427.) rts have found references to requests for attorneys to be objectively equivocal where a defendant uses conditional people v. shamblin, supra, 236 cal.app.4th at p. 19.) among the statements courts have found too equivocal to constitute an unambiguous request for counsel are the following: . . . i can tell you everything that i know and everything that i need to people v. sauceda-contreras (2012 should change my mind about the lawyer now. i, i need advice need some people v. shamblinthink it(people v. bacon, supra, 50 people v. cunningham, supra, 61 cal.4th at pp. 645647 davis v. united states, supra, 512 u.s. at pp. 455, 462.) 21 have an attorney here with me, were ambiguous. in light of this ambiguity, valasi clearly informed calderon he could have an attorney present, and repeatedly attempted to clarify per. (see people v. sauceda-contreras, supra, 55 cal.4th at pp. 219220.) in response to nted an attorney. instead, he repeatedly stated that he and the detective could talk. calderon argues that the detective dropped her friendly and encouraging demeanor when he initially mentioned an in his declaration, certainly, the detective cannot be faulted for moving to end the interview upon the mention of an attorney; in fact, this is what calderon contends the detective should have done. the record reflects nothing suggesting the detective displayed anger or any emotion amounting to coerciveness. (iv) failure to clarify the right to appointed counsel calderon further argues that when he said he could not afford an attorney, valasi should have confirmed one would be appointed for him without charge. he contends his statements demonstrated he misunderstood the initial advisements, and counsel was manipulative. 22 the translation of the recorded interview shows that when calderon stated he could not afford an attorney, valasi immediately reminded him of the rights she had previously read to him. the transcript indicates the immediately following portion of the conversation was unintelligible, and valasi and calderon were talking over each other. thus, it is unclear how, did not simply ignore it. trial counsel could reasonably have been concerned that, if a suppression motion was litigated, valasi his declaration that she did not tell him an attorney would be provided at no cost. (c) counsel had a reasonable tactical basis for declining to move for suppression prior to the plea in light of the foregoing, the record demonstrates that defense counsel had legitimate tactical reasons for failing to move to suppress prior to trial. conviction based on ineffective assistance of counsel on direct people v. mickel (2016) 2 cal.5th 181, 198; people v. woodruff (2018) 5 decisions and presume his or her actions can be explained as a matter of sound trial strategy. (people v. mai (2013) 57 cal.4th 986, 1009; people v. brown (2014) 59 cal.4th 86, 109; people v. gonzalez (1998) 64 cal.app.4th 432, 437be cases . . . where for tactical reasons counsel [forgoes] making a 23 defense counsel was faced with the following situation. the success of a suppression motion was uncertain at best. as explained, the involuntariness and invocation of the right to counsel claims were not meritorious. the other two claimsthat the wording of the miranda advisements was flawed and that valasi did not adequately reiterate the right to an appointed attorneyeven if meritorious, might well have been undercut if valasi testified in opposition to the motion, explaining the portions of the transcript that were unintelligible. moreover, the confession, while doubtless powerful evidence, was not the only the victim would testify, just as she did at the preliminary hearing. counsel was aware, through her investigator, that the victim was believable and that her testimony was likely to be credited by the jury. thus, even if counsel successfully moved to suppress the confession, the people were likely to present strong evidence of guilt. had calderon exercised his right not to testify, account. had calderon opted to testify and denied the accusations, his confession would likely have been admissible to impeach him, despite any miranda violation. (see people v. nguyen (2015) 61 cal.4th 1015, 1075; people v. peevy, supra, 17 cal.4th at p. 1188 [statements obtained in violation of miranda, harris v. new york (1971) 401 u.s. 222, 224226; people v. case (2018) 5 cal.5th 1, 24; people v. bradford (1997) 14 cal.4th 1005, 1039 [failure to give miranda warnings does not in and of itself constitute coercion].) counsel managed to obtain a favorable plea offer. calderon was facing a potential sentence of 120 years to life in prison. in 24 approximately 3340 years. yet counsel managed to obtain an 18-year offer, which the trial court characterized as a counsel unsuccessfully moved to suppress the confession, a determination that it was admissible would have lessened the interest in cementing a plea deal. (see people v. gonzalez (1993) obtained a pretrial determination concerning admissibility [of and that determination was admissiblethen, prosecution risks having been reduced, in sum, counsel did not provide substandard performance by failing to move to suppress, or by failing to inaccurately tell calderon that his confession was surely inadmissible. (see people v. saldana (1984) 157 cal.app.3d 443, 459 [no ineffective assistance when failure to make a pretrial motion is an informed tactical decision].) (d) calderon has failed to establish prejudice for the same reasons, calderon has failed to establish prejudice, i.e., that he would have declined to plead absent defendant, with effective assistance, would have accepted [or rejected] the plea offer, pertinent factors to be considered include: whether counsel actually and accurately communicated the offer to the defendant; the advice, if any, given by counsel; the disparity between the terms of the proposed plea bargain and the probable consequences of proceeding to trial, as viewed at the time of the offer; and whether the defendant indicated he or she 25 was amenable to negotiating a plea bargain. in this context, a -serving statement . . . [regarding whether] with competent advice he or she would [or would not] have accepted a proffered plea bargain, is insufficient in and of itself to sustain corroborated independently by objective evidence. a contrary holding would lead to an unchecked flow of easily fabricated people v. breslin, supra, 205 cal.app.4th at p. 1421, citing in re alvernaz, supra, 2 cal.4th at p. 938.) as we have explained, calderon faced 120 years to life in prison, but pled to an agreement that required only an 18-year term. had he proceeded to trial, the likelihood of conviction was very strong, even if the confession had been excluded from the -in-chief. calderon has therefore failed to establish prejudice, i.e., purported incompetence, he would not have pled and would have insisted on proceeding to trial. (see people v. breslin, supra, 205 cal.app.4th at pp. 1416, 1418; people v. archer, supra, 230 cal.app.4th at p. 706.) that he would not have pled had he known the confession was excludable fails to establish prejudice for two reasons: first, the trial court was not obliged to credit his self-serving assertions. (people v. breslin, supra, 205 cal.app.4th at p. 1421.) and second, for the reasons we have explained, it is not clear that a suppression motion would have succeeded. ruling on the motion was not an abuse of discretion. 26 disposition is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports edmon, p. j. we concur: egerton, j. dhanidina, j.
