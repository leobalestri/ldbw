(a), 664). the information specially alleged committing both offenses ( 12022, subd. (b)(1)). quintanilla pleaded not guilty and denied the special allegation. 2. the offenses according to the evidence at troom when quintanilla entered the home. barragan was on a ladder unable to see chest. ramos lay on the floor with blood pouring out of him. quintanilla then attacked barragan and tried jabbing him with the knife through the rungs of the ladder before fleeing. ramos was 79 years old. he died from a single stab wound that penetrated his heart and severed his coronary artery. 3. found at the scene, huntington park police officers asked quintanilla whether he would agree to an interview at the police station. 1 statutory references are to the penal code. 3 quintanilla was told at the outset he was not under arrest, he did not have to speak with the officers and he could leave any time he wanted. quintanilla said he understood and wanted to cooperate. at some point during the interview, after quintanilla had repeatedly denied being interview along with detective gabriel alpizar, took a break and then returned with sergeant john navarette. navarette said he believed quintanilla was involved in the murder and told him he was going to be arrested. quintanilla was immediately advised of his right to remain silent, to the presence of an attorney, and, if indigent, to appointed counsel. (miranda v. arizona (1966) 384 u.s. 436 [86 s.ct. 1602, 16 l.ed.2d 694] (miranda).) quintanilla responded he understood his rights and wished to continue to talk to the detectives and navarette. ou want to say anything, you have for murder. and if you want to talk [to] us and tell us the truth, you have to come to us. you have to go to the jailer and then you have to ask for detective navia or detective alpizar, okay? the two detecti nilla said he did not, but wanted to know certain things, like where he would be stationed and what the charges would be. after he was informed the charge was murder, he would be held in custody at the jail and there would be no bail in a murder case, he 4 alpizar repprobably on asked want to the interview resumed shortly thereafter without sergeant navarette. before ready to take you over to the jail area, you were asking a bunch of questions . . . about . . .quintanilla confirmed he had requested to speak to the detectives about the case without an attorney present. the detectives then readvised quintanilla of his rights under miranda, and quintanilla agreed to speak to them about the case. quintanilla hired people to work handyman jobs for him. he said hello to ramos in spanish after he walked in, and ramos suddenly advanced on him with a knife in his hand. quintanilla grabbed the knife from ramos and stabbed him in the chest believing ramos was going to attack him. he denied trying to stab barragan. quintanilla said he panicked as soon as he realized he had stabbed ramos. he fled the scene and threw the knife away. 4. quintanill quintanilla filed a pretrial motion to suppress his statements to the detectives, contending they were the result of an interrogation that had improperly continued after he invoked his right to counsel in violation of his fifth and fourteenth amendment rights. 5 request for counsel by discontinuing the interrogation and their brief responses to lawyer did not amount to the functional equivalent of interrogation. the court also ruled the statements were not involuntary. 5. , verdict and sentence at trial the evidence focused on whether ramos or quintanilla had been the aghad not been home the morning of the murder, ramos routinely used a large, distinctive knife to cut a papaya every morning; he always left the knife on the kitchen counter or in the sink when he was finished; and the knife had been missing since the murder. police at the scene testified that a half-cut papaya was on the kitchen counter when they arrived, but the papaya knife could not be found. quintanilla testified on his own behalf, reiterating his statements to police that ramos had advanced on him with a knife in his hand. he reacted to protect himself, inadvertently stabbing ramos in the ensuing struggle. a clinical psychologist testified on that a young man would have felt threatened when confronted by a person with a knife in such close psychologist also opined the acts of discarding the weapon and failing to report the incident were consistent with someone experiencing acute stress disorder. the jury was instructed as to first degree premeditated murder and second degree murder, lesser included offenses of voluntary and involuntary manslaughter, imperfect self defense and justifiable homicide. the jury found quintanilla guilty of both murder and attempted murder, determined the murder was willful, deliberate and premeditated, 6 and found the special weapon-use allegation true as to both offenses. the court sentenced quintanilla to an aggregate state prison term of 34 years to life.2 discussion 1. the trial court did nstatements to police a. governing law and standard of review miranda admonitions (advising a suspect of his or her right to remain silent, to the presence of an attorney and, if indigent, to appointed counsel) must be given and an individual in custody must knowingly and intelligently waive those rights before being rhode island v. innis (1980) 446 u.s. 291, 300-301 [100 s.ct. 1682, 64 l.ed.2d 297]; people v. ray (1996) 13 cal.4th 313, 336.) . . the police should know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from the people v. enraca (2012) 53 cal.4th 735, 752 (enraca); accord, people v. dement (2011) 53 cal.4th 1, 26; see davis v. united states (1994) 512 u.s. 452, 458 [114 s.ct. 2350, 129 l.ed.2d 362]; edwards v. arizona (1981) 451 u.s. 477, 485-486 [101 s.ct. 1880, 68 l.ed.2d 378]; rhode island v. innis, supra, 446 u.s. at p. 301.)3 determining whether the words or actions of the police were likely to lead to an incriminating response focuses on the perception of the suspect, rather than the intent of the officers involved.

(enraca, supra, 53 cal.4th at p. 756.) the court expressly rejected the argument that quintanilla makes here, that the officer coerced the 9 he would have to wait, possibly several days, for an attorney to be appointed for him: could consult with appointed counsel immediately. defendant was correctly informed that he could acquire his own counsel or, if he was eligible, counsel would be appointed when he was armiranda enraca, supra, 53 cal.4th at p. 756; see also people v. smith, supra, 40 cal.4th at p. 483 [was appropriate because the authorities are not required to have an attorney on call for the purpose of custodial interrogation].) the other statements quintanilla challenges also fall short of constituting improper interrogation. for instance, after invoking his right to counsel, quintanilla asked in custody, and what the charge was going to be. sergeant navarette told him the charge was murder; and detective navia, interpreting the question as relating to the availability of bail, commented there would be no bail in a murder case. the detectives also told quintanilla they could not answer any more questions because he had invoked his right to counsel. we agree with quintanilla that his questions about the charges and where he would be housed while in custody did not reinitiate discussions of the investigation so as to constitute a waiver of his miranda rights and permit further questioning about the case. (see people v. gamache, supra, 48 cal.4th at p. 385; people v. san nicolas, supra, 34 cal.4th at p. not amount to interrogation in violation of miranda. (see people v. dement, supra, 53 constitutes interrogation. the police may speak to a suspect in custody as long as the people v. clark (1993) 5 cal.4th 950, 985, disapproved on another ground in people v. 10 doolin (2009) 45 cal.4th 390, 421, fn. 22 [same]; see also people v. huggins, supra, 38 cal.4th at p. investigation was not reasonably likely to elicit incriminating response and, therefore, was not interrogation in violation of miranda]; clarkinvocation of right to counsel did not constitute improper interrogation].) people v. neal (2003) 31 cal.4th 63, on which quintanilla relies, is inapposite. in neal the interrogating officer continued to question the defendant about the case after the defendant had invoked his right to counsel because, even though the officer knew the interrogation violated miranda, impeach him should he choose to testify. (neal, at p. 74; see people v. depriest (2007) 42 cal.4th 1, 32 [voluntary confession obtained in violation of miranda admissible for obtained in violation of miranda, chief, but also were involuntary, and thus not admissible at all. the court emphasized miranda during the course of the interrogation custody, silence and to counsel would not be honored until he confessed. (neal, at p. 83.) people v. esqueda (1993) 17 cal.app.4th 1450 is similarly misplaced. there, the defendant maintained his inculpatory statements should have been suppressed because they were elicited without the benefit of miranda rights. the people argued the defendant was not in custody at the time he made the statements. the court of appeal disagreed, finding a lack of evidence the defendant had willingly agreed to go with police to the station and would have reasonably believed he was free to leave. in addition to finding the interrogation was custodial and thus subject to the protections of miranda, the court of appeal also concluded the confession was involuntary under the totality of the circumstances: police engaged in interrogation for 11 more than eight hours, in which the defendant received no food and little, if any, respite esqueda, at p. 1485.) in addition, the officers used lies and promises of more lenient treatment to obtain a confession, effectively telling the defendant he would not have to go to prison if he told them the emotions and minimal education to overcome his resistance and induce an involuntary confession. (id. at pp. 1484; see id. at pp. 1486-1487.) here, in contrast, there was no evidence of any oppressive conditions of interrogation.4 quintanilla was neither deceived by false promises nor coerced by oppressive conditions into waiving his miranda rights. (see people v. clark, supra, 5 cal.4th at p. suggestion that if defendant confessed he would receive more favorable treatment, or that if he did not conneither the product of unlawful interrogation nor involuntary. 2. substantial evidence supmurder quintanilla contends there is insufficient evidence to support his conviction of first degree murder on a premeditation theory.

(id. at pp. 26-27; accord, people v. steele (2002) 27 cal.4th 1230, 1249.) the list was not intended to be exhaustive or require that the identified factors appear in any specific combination or be afforded any particular weight.
