(a)(2)),1 one count of criminal threats ( 422, subd. (a)), and one count of battery ( 243, subd. (a)). on appeal he contends insufficient evidence supports his pandering conviction, and his third strike sentence of 25-years-to-life for criminal threats is unauthorized under section 1170.12. we affirm. background on june 26, 2012, appellant grabbed 18-year-old s.v. by her arm when she was walking up her apartment building stairs. he held her arm, so she could not break free, told her ,said ershim, meaning lankershim avenue in los angeles. appellant then put his hand inside s.v.s shirt and touched her breast. appellant said he knew which apartment she lived in and stated if she did not work for him he would kill her. after s.v. reported the incident to the police, los angeles police officer tara munjekovich of the vice unit initiated an undercover operation. munjekovich arranged a meeting with appellant at which she told appellant she had been working as a prostitute and appellant told her she could make about a thousand dollars a night on lankershim, and offered to when she asked how much money she could keep, he told her he did not let his girls keep any money, so she would have to give him all the cash she made. when she asked about competition from other girls, appellant told munjekovich he ran the showand would he also said take care of all her needs, pay her bills, and pay for her to get her hair and nails done. appellant then asked munjekovich to go out and make $400 that night as an fee for his s prove her loyalty to him. he assured her she w he instructed her to go buy some condoms and call him once she made the money so he could collect it. appellant was arrested at the scene and taken into custody. 1 all statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise noted. 3 appellant was tried by jury and found guilty of two counts of pandering by encouraging s.v. and officer munjekovich to become prostitutes ( 266i, subd. (a)(2)), making criminal threats against s.v. ( 422, subd. (a)), and simple battery of s.v. ( 243, subd. (a)). the trial court sentenced appellant to 41-years-to-life in state prison. discussion a. there is substantial evidence that appellant encouraged munjekovich to become a prostitute appellant contends insufficient evidence supported his pandering conviction in regards to officer munjekovich. we disagree. in reviewing for sufficiency of the evidence, we consider hole record in the light most favorable to the judgment below to determine whether a reasonable trier of fact could find the (people v. jones (2013) 57 cal.4th 899, 960; people v. smith (2005) 37 cal.4th 733, 738-739.) testimony of a single witness, unless physically impossible or inherently improbable, is sufficient to support a conviction. (evid. code,  411; people v. young (2005) 34 cal.4th 1149, 1181.) section 266i, subdivision (a), provides: son who does any of the following is guilty of pandering . . . [] (1) procures another person for the purpose of prostitution. [] (2) by promises, threats, violence, or by any device or scheme, causes, induces, persuades, or encourages another person to encourage (people v. hashimoto (1976) 54 cal.app.3d 862, 867.) encouragement evidence is sufficient to support a pandering conviction when a defendant identifies himself as a pimp, asks a target to turn over her earnings to him, and (people v. zambia (2011) 51 cal.4th 965, 981.) appellant argues evidence supporting a pandering conviction must show that a defendant initiated the conversation about prostitution and actively pursued the target. he claims the evidence here was insufficient because officer munjekovich approached him and asked about working as a prostitute. 4 this argument is without merit because a defendant may be guilty of pandering, (people v. zambia, supra, 51 cal.4th at p. 977; people v. bradshaw (1973) 31 cal.app.3d 421.) a defendant encourages a person t when he offers to her if she turns over her earnings to him. (people v. zambia, supra, 51 cal.4th at p. 977.) here, officer munjekovich inquired about working as a prostitute in los angeles and appellant encouraged her to work under his aegis. appellant asked munjekovich to for his wshe could make about a thousand dollars a night working as keep any money, so she would have to give him all the cash she made. in return he promised to take care of all her needs, including paying all her bills and ensuring that her hair and nails were always done. appellant told munjekovich he ran the show and would describe a pimp. a reasonable trier of fact could conclude from this evidence that ( 266i, subd. (a).) b. third strike sentence was proper appellant contends his third strike sentence of 25-years-to-life for criminal threats was unauthorized. we disagree. section 1170.12, as amended by proposition 36 in 2012, provides that a recidivist offender with two or more prior qualifying strikes is subject to an indeterminate life sentence if convicted of a serious or violent felony. subdivision (b)(1) of section 1170.12 defines serious felony as section 1192.7. section 1192.7 identifelony. ( 1192.7, subd. (c)(1).) 5 appellant argues section 1170.12 exempts a conviction under section 266 for a sex offense, such as pandering, from third strike sentencing. gument rests on the false premise that the third strike was imposed for his pandering conviction under section 266. that is not the case. acriminal threats conviction makes him subject to an indeterminate life sentence under section 1170.12. his 25-years-to-life sentence was imposed for this count. appellant does not contest the sentence as applied to his criminal threats conviction. therefore, his sentence was proper. disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published. chaney, j. we concur: rothschild, acting p. j. johnson, j.
