slapping anyone. soto, ying, chu and reicheun continued to drink from the pitcher. sanchez also remained in the parking lot to finish his cigarette and tried to ignore appellant who was hostile towards him. a couple of minutes later, sanchez saw ying come out of the bar to the parking lot. ying and appellant approached one another and engaged in a verbal confrontation. the confrontation escalated and ying and appellant began wrestling. sanchez attempted to break up the fight. soto, who arrived in the parking lot as appellant and ying were rising from the ground, approached appellant and yelled at him. a few seconds later, soto, punched soto in the faappellant approached soto from behind and struck him on the head with the glass beer pitcher, causing it to shatter into pieces. soto touched the back of his head and found that it was bleeding. appellant and his friend who had punched soto in the face left together in the same car. san gabriel police officer vy van responded to a call regarding a fight at bar in the early hours of february 18, 2010. officer van noticed that soto had a three-inch laceration on the top of his head and blood was coming down the left side and back of his head. as a result of the attack, soto suffered a concussion and was 4 treated at the hospital where he received 14 staples to close the head wound. soto suffered memory loss and had headaches for four to five months after the attack. san gabriel police officer andy texeira also responded to the scene. as part of his investigation he went to the san gabriel valley medical center which was located texeira obwere sliced open and blood was seeping through a towel that appellant had wrapped around his hand. on february 23, 2010, detective allen sam of the san gabriel police department met with soto and showed him a photographic six-pack. soto identified appellant as the person he saw holding the glass pitcher. chu was shown a photographic lineup and h the defense case appellant testified on his own behalf. he drank three or four beers at home and . while there he drank a few more beers and bought a pitcher of beer for a friend from high school. when his friend left he took the pitcher with the remaining beer and went outside to smoke a cigarette. a group of four or five men approached him in the parking lot. an argument started but he cannot remember how it was initiated because he was intoxicated. appellant remembered that the group of men left and then returned a few moments later. he was drinking from the pitcher and smoking a cigarette as the group of men approached him. at least three people were close to him and one grabbed his shirt as he was being pushed towards the street. appellant remembered being hit a few times as he was pushed around and struggled to keep his balance. as he tried to get away from the men he swung his right hand holding the pitcher. he felt a sharp pain in his right hand and saw that there was blood coming from it. at that point he testified that he 5 eone because he was in shock and wanted to move towards the bar to get away from the group of men. appellant recognized someone that he had seen playing pool earlier and asked for help. that person gave appellant a shirt to wrap his bloody hand and drove him to the hospital. at the hospital, he told officer texeira he had been at a bar earlier but did not tell him that he sustained the injury when he had been surrounded by a group of men and accidentally swung and broke a glass pitcher. a week later officer texeira interviewed appellant regarding the incident and appellant said he got into an argument with some men. they pushed and attacked him. in trying to get away from them, he felt a pain in his hand and realized he had broken the glass pitcher. appellant testified that he did not use the pitcher as a weapon or in self- rebuttal officer texeira testified that when he contacted appellant at the hospital and inquired as to how he sustained the hand injury, appellant told him that he had been at a bar and felt a sharp pain in his hand. appellant saw that his hand was bleeding and believed he got it caught in a door. when officer texeira followed up on this explanation, appel discusssion i. the failure to request a jury instruction on accident did not violate a. contention appellant contends that trial counsel provided ineffective representation in failing to request a jury instruction on the defense of accident in accordance with judicial council of california criminal jury instructions, calcrim no. 3404.3 appellant 3 calcrim no. 3404 provides in part as follows (as to general or specific intent [the defendant is not guilty of __________ <insert crime[s]> if (he/she) acted 6 contends instruction on the accident defense was

ground of lack of sufficient prejudice, which we expect will often be so, that course should be strickland v. washington, supra, 466 u.s. at p. 697.) does not require a specific intent to injure the victim or a subjective awareness of the risk that an injury might occur. (people v. williams (2001) 26 cal.4th 779, 788, 790.) capable of committing crimes except those belonging to the following classes: [] . . . [] fivepersons who committed the act or made the omission charged through misfortune [or failed to act] without the intent required for that crime, but acted instead accidentally. you may not find the defendant guilty of __________ <insert crime[s]> unless you are 7 or by accident, when it appears that there was no evil design, intention, or culpable people v. anderson (2011) 51 cal.4th 989, 996.) c. analysis events was that he was attacked by several men and in the process of trying to get away, the pitcher in his hand accidentally broke and he sustained injuries to his hand. witnesses sanchez and chu testified that he swung the pitcher and hit soto in the head with it. the primary dispute was whether appellant acted intentionally or accidentally, and the resolution of this dispute was based on credibility, a determination for the jury to make. the jury was instructed pursuant to calcrim no. 875 on the elements of the charged offense. to find appellant guilty of assault with a deadly weapon, the people were required to prove beyond a readeadly weapon other than a firearm that by its nature would directly and probably result in the application of force to a person; [] 2. [appellant] did that act willfully; [] 3. when [appellant] acted, he was aware of facts that would lead a reasonable person to realize that his act by its nature would directly and probably result in the application of force to someone; [] and [] 4. when [appellant] acted, he had the present ability to apply does it willingly or on purpose. it is not required that he or she intend to break the law, hurt someone else, or gain any advantage. [] the terms application of force and apply force mean to touch in a harmful or offensive manner. the slightest touching can be enough if it is done in a rude or angry way. making contact with another person, including through his or her clothing, is enough. the touching does not have to cause pain or injury of any kind. [] the touching can be done indirectly by causing an object to touch the other person. [] the people are not required to prove that [appellant] actually touched someone. [] the people are not required to prove that [appellant] actually intended to use force against someone when he acted. [] no one needs to 8 consider that fact, along with all the other evidence, in deciding whether [appellant] committed an assault, and if so, what kind of assault it was. [] voluntary intoxication is pursuant to calcrim no. 250, the jury was instructed that the crimes charged find a person guilty of the crime of assault with a deadly weapon . . . that person must not only commit the prohibited act, but must do so with wrongful intent. a person acts with wrongful intent when he or she intentionally does a prohibited act; however, it is not calcrim no. 200 to consider all of the instructions together. events, it could not have found him guilty of assault with a deadly weapon. the jury acted willfully. adversely to appellant under other proper instructions, the failure to give the instruction was harmless. (people v. sedeno (1974) 10 cal.3d 703, 721.) it is not reasonably probable that the result would have been any different had the instruction been given (people v. watson (1956) 46 cal.2d 818, 836). we are also satisfied that the failure to give the accident instruction did not contribute to the verdict (chapman v. california (1967) 386 u.s. 18, 24.) performance fell below the standard of reasonable effective assistance. (strickland v. washington, supra, 466 u.s. at p. 697.) 9 ii. motion to dismiss his prior strike a. contention appellant contends that the trial court abused its discretion by refusing to dismiss his prior strike because it was not a crime of violence and it fell outside the spirit of the three strikes law. b. relevant authority in romero, the california supreme court held that a trial court may strike an allegation under the three strikes law that a defendant has previously been convicted of a 1385, subdivision (a). (people v. williams (1998) 17 cal.4th 148, 159 (williams).) the the interests of society represented by the people, in determining whether there should be people v. superior court (romero), supra, 13 cal.4th at p. 530.) in deciding whether to strike a prior consider whether, in light of the nature and circumstances of his present felonies and prior serious and/or violent felony convictions, and the particulars of his background, whole or in part, and hence should be treated as though he had not previously been convicted of one or more serious and/or vwilliams, supra, at p. 161.) strike a prior conviction allegation under section 1385 people v. carmony (2004) 33 cal.4th 367, 375 (carmonyfailing to strike a prior felony conviction allegation in limited circumstances. for ation], or where the court considered impermissible factors in strikes id. at p. 378.) 10 sentencing decision was irrational or arbitrary. [citation.] in the absence of such a showing, the trial court is presumed to have acted to achieve the legitimate sentencing objectives, and its discretionary determination to impose a particular sentence will not be nor warranted in substituting its judgment for the judgment of the trial jud[citations.] taken together, these precepts establish that a trial court does not abuse its discretion unless its decision is so irrational or arbitrary that no reasonable person could carmony, supra, 33 cal.4th at pp. 376377.) c. analysis there is no showing that the trial court was either unaware of its discretion or considered impermissible factors. we cannot say that its ruling was irrational or ts, as well a sentence of one year. appellant contends that the key fact which convinced the court to refuse to strike the strike was the violent felony. but that oversimplifies and misstates the analysis conducted by the trial court suspected that it that appellant took a firearm from the residence. furthermore, it appears from the record stated the specific facts of the prior burglary are not clear from the record here but we 11 does not require multiple violent felony offenses to come within the statutory scheme. williams[, supracareer must consist entirely or principally of violent or serious felonies to bring a defendant within the spirit of the three strikes law.people v. strong (2001) 87 cal.app.4th 328, 340, second italics added.) prior burglary constituted a strike, it was far from irrational for the court to refuse to treat appellant as if he had not previously suffered a strike. accordingly, we find no abuse of disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. _____________________, j. doi todd we concur: ____________________________, p. j. boren ____________________________, j. chavez
