[] it [was] also alleged that he ha[d] three 3] would apply the trial court explained to thomas that, should he go to trial and a jury were to find him guilty of the alleged offenses, he would face up to five years in state prison for the robbery, up to three years in prison for the burglary, and if he were convicted of the robbery, he would face an additional -year priors, meaning that each of these robberies, from 1997, from 1987 [and from] 1994 . . . [would] add[] an additional five [thomas had] four prior strbut what they are also offering you is almost equally important[.] [b]esides the number of years in reduction from the possible sentence, is the fact that they are offering to let you plead to a commercial burglary, which is not considered a strike. [] so if in the future you were to pick up a new case, it would make a big difference to any judge who prior strike convictions that are old and a new strike. that would certainly increase the you in that if you were to plead to the robbery charge, you would have to serve 3 penal cpunishable in different ways by different provisions of law shall be punished under the provision that provides for the longest potential term of imprisonment, but in no case shall the act or omission be punished under more than one provision. an acquittal or conviction and sentence under any one bars a prosecution for the same act or omission 5 85 percent. but if you plead to the burglary charge, you would serve only 80 percent because you are admitting to the [prior] strike. so there is a substantial difference in the amount of time that you would be facing between having a jury trial and being found and if you are found guilty, if the strikes are proven, if the five-year priors are proven, it not bound by this offer of nine years, four months on these two cases, and will do what i deem appr after conferring with counsel, thomas asked the trial court if it would be possible o happen before your trial because that things, be required to place on the record its reasons for striking a strike. the court e] in effect willing to offer [thomas] the granting of a romero[4- thomas indicated he had one more question for the court. he . . .

[] . . . [] however, given your plea here today, you would be pleading to count 2, which is a violation of penal code section 459, which is commonly known as second degree commercial burglary [from] the e high term of three years. that would be doubled given your 1994 prior conviction, which results [in] six years[] state prison. plus you would be admitting . . . your two prior one-year priors under penal code section 667.5[, subdivision] (b), which would then calculate to a total 7 thomas had agreed to be sentenced with regard to his prior admission that he had violated penal code section 666, subdivision (a), petty theft with priors as committed against the target store. as to that matter, he was to be sentenced to the low term of 16 months in prison. in total, thomas was to be sentenced to nine years four months in prison for the two cases. after the prosecutor explained the consequences of the plea and he waived his right to a jury trial, his right to remain silent, his right to confront and cross-examine the witnesses against him, his right to use the subpoena power of the court and his right to present a defense, thomas pled no contest to count 2 of felony information no. on march 28, 1994, he had been convicted of bank robbery in case no. la16457, that on september 3, 2002, he had been convicted of possession of a controlled substance in violation of health and safety code section 11350, subdivision (a) in case no. ba226287 and that on september 14, 2005, he had been convicted of penal code section 666, petty theft with priors, in case no. ma032632. the trial court indicated that in case no. ba381214, thomas had admitted to a me[d] that the . . trial court then indicated that it could impose the agreed upon 16 months in prison. the admission to the strike prior [in] pursuant to the plea agreement, in case no. ba382542, the trial court sentenced thomas to the high term of three years in state prison, doubled the term pursuant to penal imposed a consecutive term of one year pursuant to penal code section 667.5, 8 thomas was awarded presentence custody credit for 90 days actually served and 44 days of good time/work time, for a total of 134 days. with regard to case no. ba381214, a violation of penal code section 666, subdivision (a), the trial court sentenced thomas to the low term of 16 months, the term to run consecutive to the sentence imposed in case no. ba382542. for this case, the trial court awarded thomas presentence custody credit for 10 days actually served and 4 days motion that all remaining counts and allegations be dismissed pursuant to section 1385.5 as to both cases, thomas was ordered to pay a $200 restitution fine (pen. code,  1202.4, subd. (b)), a $40 court security charge (pen code,  1465.8, subd. (a)(1)), a $30 criminal conviction assessment (gov. code,  70373) and a $200 suspended parole revocation restitution fine (pen. code,  1202.45). thomas was remanded to the custody of the sheriff for transportation to the department of corrections. the trial court recommended that he receive drug counseling. on july 6, 2011, thomas filed timely notices of appeal from both case nos. ba382542 and ba381214. contentions after examination of the record, counsel filed an opening brief which raised no issues and requested this court to conduct an independent review of the record. by notice filed march 16, 2012, the clerk of this court advised thomas to submit within 30 days any contentions, grounds of appeal or arguments he wished this court to consider. on april 2, 2012, thomas filed a letter brief in which he raised a number of issues. initially, he asserted the record failed to show that he knowingly and intelligently 5 penal comay, either of his or her own motion or upon the application of the prosecuting attorney, 9 waived his boykin/tahl6 rights before entering his plea of no contest to second degree commercial burglary. however, a review of the transcript of the proceedings indicates otherwise. before entering the plea, thomas was advised of and waived his right to a jury trial, his right to remain silent, his right to confront and cross-examine the witnesses against him, his right to use the subpoena power of the court and his right to present a defense. thomas next contends that his counsel had been ineffective for failing to carefully review the files of convictions that were alleged as priors. the contention is without merit. although an indigent defendant has the right to the effective assistance of counsel in re spears his counsel failed to adequately review the alleged priors is unsupported by any facts indicating any of the priors was improper. under these circumstances, it cannot be said that counsel failed to investigate the prior convictions or to determine their legitimacy. thomas asserts that prior felony convictions obtained by a plea (see pen. code,  1192.7, subd. ((b)) may not be used for purposes of plea bargaining (see pen. code,  1170.12, subd. (e)) unless the prosecution has proved the prior convictions. however convictions. he admitted them. the same is the prosecutor did not adequately show that his priors amounted to serious or violent felonies. thomas admitted as such. in his fifth contention, thomas appears to be asserting that the prosecution erred by failing to hold a proper hearing before striking his prior convictions pursuant to people v. superior court (romero), supra, 13 cal.4th 497. the trial court noted, romero 6 boykin v. alabama (1969) 395 u.s. 238; in re tahl (1969) 1 cal.3d 122. 10 -actions and he should not now complain about the procedures followed. in his finabecause of some factual or legal misrepresentationhowever, does not indicate what that misrepresentation was. review on appeal we have examined the entire record and are satisfied counsel has complied fully smith v. robbins (2000) 528 u.s. 259, 278-284; people v. wende (1979) 25 cal.3d 436, 443.) disposition the judgments are affirmed. not to be published in the official reports kitching, j. we concur: klein, p. j. croskey, j.
