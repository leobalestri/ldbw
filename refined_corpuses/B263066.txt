(a)(1)) (count 1); assault upon a peace officer with a deadly weapon (pen. code,  245, subd. (c)) (count 2); and evading an officer with willful and wanton disregard (veh. code,  2800.2, subd. (a)) (count 3). the jury deadlocked on counts 1 and 2, and the trial court declared a mistrial on those counts, which were later dismissed after the prosecution indicated it was unable to proceed on them. the jury found appellant guilty on count 3, which the court later summary probation for three years on condition that she serve 180 days in jail. appellant contends on count 3 and asks us to conduct an independent review under pitchess v. superior court (1974) 11 cal.3d 531 (pitchess). we find no pitchess error. however, we find that the prosecution did not prove all of the elements of count 3 because there was no evidence the front. we therefore reverse the judgment on count 3. facts prosecution case on october 6, 2012, shortly after 7:00 p.m., the monterey park police department began receiving calls about a fight with shots fired and a man down at the parlor on atlantic boulevard. officers jeffrey sanchez, timothy wisniewski, and rudy contreras responded to the scene. the parking lot was chaotic, with people running and screaming. officer sanchez saw four hispanic men fighting in the parking lot. when he approached and ordered them to lie on the ground, two of the men ignored him and started walking away. seconds later, appellant, who was driving a black honda civic, stopped the car between officer sanchez and the two men. boyfriend, got i dozen times. but appellant drove quickly through the parking lot. officer sanchez lost sight of the car. 3 officer wisniewski then saw officer contreras in the parking lot. officer contreras was in uniform and in a marked black and white police vehicle. officer wisniewski ran up to him and pointed out the fleeing honda. officer contreras immediately turned on his emergency lights and siren and pursued appellant through the parking lot to atlantic boulevard. when appellant drove onto atlantic boulevard, squealed. officer contreras followed the honda in his police vehicle. appellant did not come to a stop until officer wisniewski, who was standing in the road facing the honda, fired a defense case on the day of the incident, appellant attended a series of football games with her games. a chaotic fight broke out. everyone was scared, yelling and running toward their cars. appellant went outside and found her son. she got into the honda that belonged to her appellant was at the wheel and her sister was in the backseat holding , who was crying continuously. his shirt near his waist, as if holding something. the father of her son, ran toward the man. appellant was scared. then her boyfriend ran back toward her and got in the car. when appellant turned onto atlantic boulevard, her tires did not squeal. appellant did not hear any sirens and did not know the police were behind her; she never looked in her rearview mirror. a few seconds later, an officer in a dark uniform ran out of the parking lot with a shotgun. without pausing in the street, the officer fired the shotgun at car. appellant stopped abruptly. when the man yelle realized he was a police officer. she never saw police officers at various points around the parking lot. 4 discussion i. pitchess motion prior to trial, appellant moved for discovery of the police personnel records of officers sanchez, wisniewski, and contreras. of moral turpitude, and prior instances of complaints of excessive use of force in order to the trial court granted the motion truth, veracity, fabrication, for the five- on february 11, 2014, the trial court conducted an in camera review. following the review, the court s no discoverable information other than this particular incident in question, so it would be [app a second in camera hearing took place on april 30, 2014, after which the trial court gave two documents to defense counsel. appellant now transcripts of the in camera hearings to determine whether any relevant police personnel records were withheld. the people have no objection. (see people v. mooc (2001) 26 cal.4th 1216, 1229determination of whether all relevant police personnel records were disclosed in response to a pitchess ng on motions people v. samayoa (1997) 15 cal.4th 795, 827.) we have reviewed the sealed transcripts of the in camera hearings pitchess motion. we find no abuse of discretion by the trial court. ii. substantial evidence initially, we note that to prevail on a sufficiency of the evidence argument, appellant must present her case to us consistent with the substantial evidence standard of review. this means she must set forth in her opening brief all of the material evidence on the disputed elements of the crime in the light most favorable to the people, and then must persuade us that this evidence cannot reasonably support the jurys verdict. (see 5 people v. dougherty (1982) 138 cal.app.3d 278, 282; people v. sanghera (2006) 139 cal.app.4th 1567, 1574.) appellant has failed to meet her required burden on appeal. her rendition of the facts is incomplete and wholly one-sided in her favor. indeed, in ls to even mention that she was driving the honda. we are sorely tempted to find that appellant has forfeited her substantial evidence challenge. we nevertheless address the merits because we agree with appellant that the prosecution failed to prove all of the elements of count 3. count 3 charged appellant with violating vehicle code section 2800.2, which makes it a crime to flee from or attempt to elude a peace officer, as described in vehicle code section 2800.1, while driving in a willful or wanton disregard for the safety of persons or property. while operating a motor vehicle and with the intent to evade, willfully flees or otherwise vehicle, is guilty . . . if all of the following conditions exist: one lighted red lamp visible from the front and the person either sees or reasonably should have seen the lamp. [] (2) as may be reasonably necessary. distinctively marked. officer, . . . and that peace off lighted red lamp visible from the front. the testimony presented was simply that he the people argue that contreras testified that he activated his lights and siren, it was inferable as a matter of the -the people do not tell us, however, that this argument was made in people v. oliver (2006) 124 cal.app.4th 624, 631, and that our supreme court specifically rejected it by ordering people v. oliver depublished and then dismissing the appeal in light of people v. hudson (2006) 38 cal.4th 1002.) the hudson court found that because vehicle code section if all of the following conditions exist, the statute requires 6 four distinct elements, each of which must be present: (1) a red light, (2) a siren, (3) a distinctively marked vehicle, and (4) a peace officer in a distinctive uniform.people v. hudson, supra, at pp. 10071008.) indeed, prior cases specifically found that the evidence must establish the color of the lights. (see people v. acevedo (2003) 105 cal.app.4th 195, 198200; people v. brown (1989) 216 cal.app.3d 596, 599600.) because the prosecutor failed to prove the required element that the activated lights were red, the conviction on vehicle code section 2800.2 cannot stand. disposition the judgment of conviction on count 3 for violating vehicle code section 2800.2 is reversed. not to be published in the official reports. __________________________, j. ashmann-gerst we concur: _____________________________, p. j. boren ____________________________, j. chavez
