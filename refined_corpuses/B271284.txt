filed 6/7/17 p. v. ellis ca2/7 not to be published in the official reports california rules of court, rule 8.1115(a), prohibits courts and parties from citing or relying on opinions not certified for publication or ordered published, except as specified by rule 8.1115(b). this opinion has not been certified for publication or ordered published for purposes of rule 8.1115. in the court of appeal of the state of california second appellate district division seven the people, plaintiff and respondent, v. matthew ellis, defendant and appellant. b271284 (los angeles county super. ct. no. ka110467) appeal from a judgment of the superior court of los angeles county, robert m. martinez, judge. reversed and remanded. lisa holder, under appointment by the court of appeal, for defendant and appellant. kathleen a. kenealy, acting attorney general, gerald a. engler, chief assistant attorney general, lance e. winters, senior assistant attorney general, margaret e. maxwell, supervising deputy attorney general, and tasha g. timbadia, deputy attorney general, for plaintiff and respondent. 2 introduction this case turns on whether deputy gilbert lozano detained matthew ellis or knew he was on parole before ellis dropped a knife that ultimately led to his conviction for carrying a concealed dirk or dagger. the trial court concluded deputy lozano and ellis engaged in a consensual encounter before ellis parole. we conclude that deputy lozano detained ellis without reasonable suspicion, and did not have advance knowledge ellis was on parole, before ellis dropped the knife. therefore, because law enforcement obtained the knife as a result of an illegal detention, we reverse the judgment and remand to the trial court knife. factual and procedural background a. ellis drops a knife during an encounter with police on the afternoon of august 19, 2015 ellis and another man sat on a curb outside the entrance to a bar in pomona. deputy lozano drove by while conducting patrol checks in the area for local transients that hang out and loiter. deputy lozano targeted the area for its high narcotics activity. he stated that a lot of local transients go [to the bar] when they buy their meth. deputy lozano knew ellis as a transient in the area who frequented the area near the bar. deputy lozano observed ellis for less than five minutes while traveling in his patrol car. during that time ellis did not stand or stumbl[e] around. after passing ellis, deputy lozano 3 made a u-turn. the deputy parked his patrol car right next to ellis, within a foot or two, and may have turned on his lights and siren. deputy lozano asked ellis and the other man if they were doing any business at the bar or a liquor store next door to the bar, and the men told him they were not. deputy lozano then directed the mens attention to a no loitering sign less than two feet from them. the deputy went ahead and told [ellis] its a violation of loitering and that weve gotten numerous complaints from the [bar] of transients just loitering in front of the business. what happened next is not clear from the record. deputy lozano originally testified that ellis told him he had nowhere else to go and was on parole. but deputy lozano also testified that he first asked ellis to approach the front hood of the patrol car, after which ellis told him he was on parole. in yet another description of their encounter, deputy lozano said ellis did not volunteer that he was on parole until after deputy lozano had asked ellis to put his hands on the hood of the patrol car and ellis had complied. at some point deputy lozano heard something drop to the ground. deputy lozano handcuffed ellis, conducted a pat search, and put ellis in the backseat of his patrol car. deputy lozano walked over to where ellis had been standing and found a knife inside a black sheath. back in the patrol car, deputy lozano confirmed that ellis was on parole. b. the o suppress the people charged ellis with one count of carrying a concealed dirk or dagger in violation of penal code section 213101 and alleged he suffered two prior serious or violent convictions. 1 undesignated statutory references are to the penal code. 4 ellis pleaded not guilty and filed a motion to suppress evidence of the knife found by deputy lozano. at a hearing on the motion to suppress, deputy lozano testified that on the day he detained ellis he was not responding to a call from anyone at the bar. he said he knew of ellis from one or more previous encounters five to six months earlier when he saw ellis collecting recyclables from a dumpster in an alley near the bar. at that time, deputy lozano said he had reason to believe ellis may have been on probation or parole, but he wasnt too sure. counsel for ellis asked deputy lozano to clarify his testimony: q: so on that day -- you knew in the past he had been on probation or parole; but on this day, you didnt know if he was on probation or parole, currently? a: correct, maam. q: so you were actually not detaining him for that but detaining him because there was a no loitering sign? a: yes, maam. q: correct? a: yes, maam. q: so thats why you initially parked, ordered him [to the car], because he was sitting under the no loitering sign, correct? a: yes, maam. q: and it was after you had detained him that you found out -- or confirmed that he was on parole, correct? a: yes, maam. counsel for ellis asked deputy lozano several additional questions about whether the deputys request that ellis move toward the patrol car was a command. for example, she twice 5 asked deputy lozano whether he ordered ellis to come to you or come here. deputy lozano responded affirmatively. deputy lozano also testified that he detained ellis for loitering in violation of los angeles county code section 13.56.010, one of two code provisions identified on the no loitering sign that hung near where ellis had been sitting. at the conclusion of testimony, counsel for ellis argued that the initial detention happened at the time that the officer pulled up to the curb [and] ordered [ellis] to come to him. she argued deputy lozano lacked reasonable suspicion to detain ellis at that time because the deputy merely observed ellis sitting on a curb. deputy lozano did not see ellis attempt to buy or sell drugs, nor did he observe any drug activity in the area at the time. counsel for lozano further argued that the loitering provision deputy lozano identified in his police report did not justify elliss detention because that provision applied only to minors, and deputy lozano testified he knew ellis was not a minor. the other code section identified on the no loitering sign, section 647, subdivision (e), applied only to a person who lodges in a building, structure, vehicle or place . . . without the permission of the owner or person entitled to possession or in control of it, and ellis was neither lodging in the bar or the nearby liquor store, nor did deputy lozano testify that anyone from the bar or store had called to complain about ellis. finally, counsel for ellis argued that, because deputy lozano did not know ellis was on parole until after he had detained ellis, elliss parole status did not validate the suspicionless search. 6 the trial court denied elliss motion to suppress. the court identified the critical issue as whether the officers request that [ellis] approach constitutes a detention. the court reasoned it was not because there was no show of force and the officer indicated he asked [ellis] to approach, as opposed to commanding him to do so. the court found that, simultaneouslyasking ellis to approachthere was a sound, his statement verifying his parole status; and the officer was entitled at that point for his own security to pat down and detain the defendant to find out what was happening there. with regard to the loitering statute and its application to minors only, the trial court ruled that deputy lozanos mistake was negated by his good faith belief the statute applied. during the subsequent trial, deputy lozano testified he had done more than simply ask ellis to approach him. he said he had in fact told or ordered ellis to put his hands on the hood of the patrol car. counsel for ellis renewed the motion to suppress, and the trial court denied it again. c. ellis is convicted and sentenced a jury convicted ellis of violating section 21310, as charged. in a separate hearing, the court found true the allegation that ellis suffered two prior serious or violent convictions under the three strikes law ( 667, subds. (b)-(j); 1170.12). the court sentenced ellis to the middle term of two years, doubled under the three strikes law, for a total prison term of four years. ellis timely appealed. 7 discussion a. standard of review and applicable law in ruling on a motion to suppress, the trial court must find the historical facts, select the rule of law, and apply it to the facts in order to determine whether the law as applied has been violated. (people v. brendlin (2008) 45 cal.4th 262, 268; see people v. linn (2015) 241 cal.app.4th 46, 56.) as the finder of fact in a proceeding to suppress evidence [citation], the superior court is vested with the power to judge the credibility of the witnesses, resolve any conflicts in the testimony, weigh the evidence and draw factual inferences in deciding whether a search is constitutionally unreasonable. [citation.] the trial court also has the duty to decide whether, on the facts found, the search was unreasonable within the meaning of the constitution. (linn, at p. 56, quoting people v. woods (1999) 21 cal.4th 668, 673.) we review the courts resolution of the factual inquiry under the deferential substantial evidence standard. the ruling on whether the applicable law applies to the facts is a mixed question of law and fact that is subject to independent review. (brendlin, supra, 45 cal.4th at p. 268; see linn, supra, 241 cal.app.4th at p. 56 [reviewing court has the ultimate responsibility to measure the facts, as found by the trier, against the constitutional standard of reasonableness].) [w]hile we defer to the superior courts express and implied factual findings if they are supported by substantial evidence, we exercise our independent judgment in determining the legality of a search on the facts so found. (linn, at pp. 56-57.) 8 a seizure of the person occurs whenever a police officer by means of physical force or show of authority restrains the liberty of a person to walk away.(people v. douglas (2015) 240 cal.app.4th 855, 860, quoting people v. celis (2004) 33 cal.4th 667, 673; see people v. brown (2015) 61 cal.4th 968, 976-977.) there are two different bases for detaining an individual short of having probable cause to arrest: (1) reasonable suspicion to believe the individual is involved in criminal activity [citation]; and (2) advance knowledge that the individual is on searchable probation or parole(douglas, at p. 860; see people v. schmitz (2012) 55 cal.4th 909, 916.) ellis contends neither basis existed prior to his detention, and, because the deputy discovered the knife as a result of that detention, the trial court should have suppressed it. in a challenge to the lawfulness of a warrantless search or seizure, the people have the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the search or seizure fell within one of the recognized exceptions to the warrant requirement. (douglas, supra, 240 cal.app.4th at p. 860; see schmitz, supra, 55 cal.4th at p. 915, fn. 4 is burden to justify a warrantless search; people v. rios (2011) 193 cal.app.4th 584, 590 [where lack[] a warrant, the people [have] the burden of establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, an exception to the warrant requirement.) b. deputy lozano detained ellis by accusing him of violating loitering laws and asking him to approach the patrol car police contacts with individuals may be placed into three broad categories ranging from the least to the most intrusive: 9 consensual encounters that result in no restraint of liberty whatsoever; detentions, which are seizures of an individual that are strictly limited in duration, scope, and purpose; and formal arrests or comparable restraints on an individuals liberty. [citations.] . . . consensual encounters do not trigger fourth amendment scrutiny. [citation.] unlike detentions, they require no articulable suspicion that the person has committed or is about to commit a crime. [citation.] an officer may approach a person in a public place and ask if the person is willing to answer questions. if the person voluntarily answers, those responses, and the officers observations, are admissible in a criminal prosecution. [citations.] a detention, on the other hand, is a seizure, albeit a limited one, for which reasonable suspicion is required. (linn, supra, 241 cal.app.4th at p. 57.) a detention occurs when an officer intentionally applies physical restraint or initiates a show of authority to which an objectively reasonable person innocent of wrongdoing would feel compelled to submit, and to which such a person in fact submits. (linn, supra, 241 cal.app.4th at p. 57; see florida v. bostick (1991) 501 u.s. 429, 434, 437-438.) in situations involving a show of authority, a person is seized if in view of all of the circumstances surrounding the incident, a reasonable person would have believed that he was not free to leave, or otherwise terminate the encounter [citation] and if the person actually submits to the show of authority. (linn, at pp. 57-58; see brendlin v. california (2007) 551 u.s. 249, 255; brown, supra, 61 cal.4th at p. 974.) the test for the existence of a show of authority is an objective one and thus, [n]either the officers uncommunicated state of mind nor the subjective belief of the individual citizen is relevant to the determination of whether a 10 police contact is a detention. (linn, at p. 58; see people v. zamudio (2008) 43 cal.4th 327, 341 objective,the intent of the police as objectively manifested to the person confronted.) circumstances indicating a detention, even where a person does not attempt to leave an encounter with law enforcement, include the threatening presence of several officers, the display of a weapon by an officer, the physical distance between an officer and the person, and the use of language or a tone of voice indicating that compliance with the offiis required. (see u.s. v. washington (9th cir. 2007) 490 f.3d 765, 771-772; linn, supra, 241 cal.app.4th at pp. 58, 65.) other relevant factors include the time and place of the encounter, whether the police indicated the defendant was suspected of a crime, whether ths documents, whether the police exhibited other threatening behavior, and whether the police informed the person of his or her right to terminate the encounter. (washington at pp. 771-772; see linn at p. 58.) in particular, [q]uestions by an officer of a sufficiently accusatory be cause to view an encounter as a nonconsensual (linn, at p. 58; see in re j.g. (2014) 228 cal.app.4th degree of suspicion expressed by the police is an important factor in determining whether a consensual encounter people v. lopez (1989) 212 cal.app.3d 289, 292.) the same is true for commands or directions issued in the course of an encounter.linn, at p. 58; see in re j.gfinding [the suspect] was under the kind of restraint associated with a fopeople v. verin (1990) 11 police officer from addressing questions to people on the street constitutes a detention because the citizen is no longer free to .) was consensual until some time after ellis volunteered he was on parole. we agree with the people that the police may question a person even when the police have no basis for suspecting the question whether ellis had any business at the bar or nearby liquor store was part of a consensual encounter, particularly if deputy lozano and siren (which is unclear from the evidence). (see bostick, supra, 501 u.s. at pp. 434-suspecting a particular individual, they may generally ask questions of that indi people v. rivera (2007) 41 cal.4th 304, 309 may approach someone on the street or in another public place .) as the people acknowledge, the fourth amendment requires only that police united states v. drayton (2002) 536 u.s. 194, 201.) the consensual encounter, however, ripened into detention when deputy lozano implicated ellis in illegal activity and asked/told/ordered ellis to put his hands on the patrol car. the circumstances here are similar to those in people v. linn, supra, 241 cal.app.4th 46, where the court held that a detention occurred when a police officer implicated the driver of a car in her of the 12 window of the car)2 and then cigarette and put down her can of soda. (id. at pp. 64-65; see people v. foranyic w]hile the officer was certainly free to approach [the defendant] and speak to him, once he ordered him to lay down his bike and step away from it, he clearly conveyed the impression [the defendant] was submitted to this show ; cf. people v. leath (2013) 217 cal.app.4th 344, 353 [the accuse defendant of any illegal activity when they first addressed people v. bouser (1994) 26 cal.app.4th 1280, 1287 ; lopez, supra, 212 cal.app.3d at p. 293 [the most importantly, did ) when deputy lozano accused ellis of violating a particular law and asked or instructed him to put his hands on the hood of the patrol car, a reasonable person would not have felt free to terminate the encounter. at that point, ellis was detained. the may not have been a formal command does not mandate a different conclusion. even accepting deputy lozano merely ellis to approach the patrol car, a reasonable person under the circumstances would have felt compelled to do so. indeed, deputy lozano already had implicated ellis in criminal loitering, and he asked not only that ellis approach him but also 2 reason for my contact was because . . . the passenger . . . was linn, supra, 241 cal.app.4th at p. 51.) 13 that ellis put his hands on the hood of the patrol car. ellis to oblige did not negate the coercive nature of the request. (see linn, supradefendant] to put out her cigarette and put down her soda can, it has been found under similar circumstances that an officer doing people v. garry of the question or request made by the authorities, but rather the manner or mode in which it is put to the citizen that guides us in u.s. v. beauchamp (6th cir. 2011) 659 f.3d 560, 569 [simply be.) in addition to accusing ellis of violating the law and asking him to put his hands on the hood of the patrol car, deputy lozano parked his patrol car very close to ellisonly one or two feet away. the positioning of the patrol car, combined with deputy question about whether ellis had any business in the area, objectively reasonable person on alert that [deputy lozano] might be investigating [ellis] specifically for a possible violation of the law and, therefore, linn, supra, 241 cal.app.4th at p. 65.) finally, there is no evidence deputy lozano informed ellis he was free to end their conversation. thus, although it is undisputed deputy lozano did not use or threaten to use physical force to detain ellis, under the totality of the circumstances a reasonable 14 have felt free to terminate the encounter with deputy lozano after the deputy accused ellis of violating loitering laws and asked him to put his hands on the patrol car. (see washington, supra, 490 f.3d at pp. 771-772.) c. deputy lozano had no reasonable suspicion to detain ellis when the detaining officer can point to specific articulable facts that, considered in light of the totality of the circumstances, provide some objective manifestation that the person detained people v. casares (2016) 62 cal.4th 808, 837-838; see people v. souza (1994) 9 cal.4th 224, factors unrelated to the defendant, such as criminal activity in casares, at p. 838; see illinois v. wardlow (2000) 528 criminal activity does not support reasonable suspicion of criminal activity]; people v. pitts (2004) 117 cal.app.4th 881, 887 individual].) people v. perrusquia (2007) 150 cal.app.4th 228, 233.) without reasonable suspicion, a person may not be detained even momentarily. (washington, supra, 490 f.3d at p. 774, quoting florida v. royer (1983) 460 u.s. 491, 498.) the people argue deputy lozano had reasonable suspicion to detain ellis because ellis was in violation of various loitering statutes and because the deputy had a vague sense that ellis 15 neither argument has merit. 1. the loitering statutes deputy lozano testified he detained ellis because he had reasonable suspicion ellis was loitering in violation of los angeles county code section 13.56.010 (section 13.56.010). minor under the age o . . . between the hours of 10:00 p.m. on any given day and deputy lozano admitted he knew ellis was not under the age of 18 (ellis was almost 40 at the time of the offense) and he encountered ellis at 4:52 p.m., well before 10:00 p.m. thus, section 13.26.010 did not apply to ellis. the scope of section 647, subdivision (e), which also was posted on , or perhaps section 647, subdivision (h). section 647, subdivision (e), provides that a lodges in any building, structure, vehicle, or place, whether public or private, without the permission of the owner or person enmisdemeanor. section 647, subdivision (h), makes it a the private property of another, at any time, without visible or lawful business with the ownelatter lawful purpose for being on the property and for the purpose of committing a crime as opportunity may be discovered 16 neither of these provisions could have provided deputy lozano with reasonable suspicion that ellis was involved in criminal activity. the bar, nor did the prosecutor attempt to show he was. an briefly sitting. cases under section 647, subdivision (e), or its predecessor, involve defendants who were camping or sleeping on private or public property without permission. (see, e.g., people v. lyons (1971) 18 cal.app.3d 760, 773 [defendant found sleeping on a cot in stone v. agnos (9th cir. 1992) 960 f.2d 893, 895 [defendant arrested for sleeping in a public plaza]; joyce v. city and county of san francisco (n.d.cal. 1994) 846 f.supp. 843, 862-863 [predecessor of section 647, subdivision (e), was not unconstitutionally vague as applied to camping on public or private property without permission].) in joyce v. city and county of san francisco, supra, 846 f.supp. 843 the court noted that san francisco police officers had even been advised not to enforce the prohibition in section 647, subdivision (e), against , but to apply it only to persons who had constructed temporary shelters. (id. at p. 863.) deputy lozano could not have had reasonable suspicion that ellis after merely observing him sit there for less than five minutes. section 647, subdivision (h), also could not provide a basis for reasonable suspicion that ellis was involved in criminal activity. that provision applies only where a person is loitering for deputy lozano to detain ellis under this provision, he had to have had a reasonable suspicion ellis intended to commit a crime. (see in re joshua m. (2001) 91 cal.app.4th 743, 747 [a person violates section 647, 17 property of another with the spec; see also in re gary h. (2016) 244 cal.app.4th 1463, 1476 [violation of section 653b, which prohibits loitering near a school, for a violation of section 647, subdivision (h), the defendant also must have this element is not met where ; it requires a more persistent, unwanted presence. (see people v. frazier (1970) 11 cal.app.3d 174, 183-184 [school repeatedly warned the defendant, who was not a student, to leave]; edgerly v. city and county of san francisco (9th cir. 2010) 599 f.3d 946, 954-955 [officers had no probable cause to arrest a non-resident of a housing cooperative for violating section 647, subdivision (h), where officers knew only that the defendant was not a resident and they had observed the defendant on the property for five minutes].) deputy lozano did not articulate any suspicion that ellis intended to commit a crime, and there is no evidence that ellis in front of the bar or was ever asked to leave and declined or returned. (see, e.g., in re gary h., supra, 244 cal.app.4th at p. 1478 [loitering with intent to engage in a fight evidenced by the frazier, supra, 11 cal.app.3d at pp. 183-184 [evidence sufficient to show the defendant loitered for the purpose of committing a crime where the defendant had frequented a school without apparent business there, repeatedly refused to leave after warnings, on one occasion 18 was under the influence of alcohol and present while others were gambling, and was parked illegally].) the people argue that, even if deputy lozano mistakenly believed ellis was subject to section 13.56.010 or some other loitering law, the evidence obtained was admissible under the so-rule and the fourth amendment, however, reasonable mistakes, and those mistakeswhether of fact or of lawmust be objectively reasonableheien v. north carolina (2014) __ u.s. , [135 s.ct. 530, 539]; see people v. campuzano (2015) 237 cal.app.4th supp. 14, 16 of law can give rise to a reasonable suspicion under the fourth ; united states v. longoria (n.d.fla. 2016) 183 f.supp.3d 1164, 1182 an unreasonable mistake of law cannot help form the basis of reasonable suspicion) an objectively reasonable mistake of law may occur where courts have not provided guidance on the scope or meaning of a particular law (see heienlaw is as reasonable a cause of seizure as a doubt respecting the ]) or where a statute is declared unconstitutional after a predicated on that statute (see id., at p. 538). the statutes at issue here are neither vague nor unconstitutional. an objectively reasonable officer could not construe section 13.26.010 to apply to a 40-year-old man during broad daylight, construe section 647, subdivision (e), to apply to someone sitting on a curb as opposed to sleeping there, or construe section 647, subdivision (h), to apply to a person who merely sat on a curb in a high crime area. (see heien, supra, ___ u.s. at p. [135 s.ct. at pp. 539-an officer can gain no 19 fourth amendment advantage through a sloppy study of the laws he is duty-bound to enforce under these circumstances, , even if well meaning, and the objectively reasonable. (see heien, supra, ___ u.s. at p. ___ [135 s.ct. (conc. opn. of kagan, j.).) 2. other the people argue that, even if the loitering statutes do not apply, deputy lozano had reasonable suspicion to believe ellis could be involved in other illegal activity. they point to the facts that deputy lozano found frequented the areas around the [bar] (where there were numerous recent complaints of individuals loitering) and [a motel], where methamphetamine was purchased criminal activity as a factor relevant to determining whether, under the totality of the circumstances, an officer had reasonable suspicion to detain a person, that fact alone is not sufficient. (see souza, supra, 9 cal.4th at p. 239; pitts, supra, 117 cal.app.4th at p. 887.) the people do not identify anything that distinguished him from everyone else in the high crime neighborhood where he apparently lived. (see pitts, supra, 117 cal.app.4th at p. 887 appellants activity was no different from the activity of other pedestrians in that neighborhood].) courts in similar circumstances have found facts like those advanced by the people here insufficient to constitute reasonable suspicion of 20 criminal activity. (see, e.g., casares, supra, 62 cal.4th at pp. 837-838 [awareness of prior robberies at a convenience store and that robbers had exited the parking lot on the north side of the building, without more, did not raise a reasonable suspicion that the defendant was engaged in criminal activity when he parked his van on that side of the building in a less well-lit part of the parking lot]; perrusquia, supra, 150 cal.app.4th at p. 233 ven recent, specific crimes, without additional factors specific to the defendant, are not sufficientsuspicion]; see also in re tony c.

(casares, at p. 838; see people v. wells (2006) 38 cal.4th 1078, 1083.) d. deputy lozano did not have advance knowledge of elliss status as a parolee suspicionless searches of parolees are lawful so long as they are not arbitrary, capricious, or harassing. (samson v. california (2006) 547 u.s. 843, 856-857; douglas, supra, 240 cal.app.4th at p. 861; see people v. schmitz, supra, 55 cal.4th at . . . are 21 and the search is not arbitrary, capricpeople v. reyes (1998) 19 cal.4th 743, 753-a parole search could become if made too often, or at an unreasonable hour, or if unreasonably prolonged or for other reasons establishing arbitrary or oppressive conduct by the searching officer].) suspicionless parole searches are justified douglas, at p. 861; accord, schmitz, at p. 921.) because a search condition is statutorily mandated for all parolees [citations], the officer need only know that the individual is on parole.douglas, supra, 240 cal.app.4th at p. 862.) the officer, however, must know the individual was on parole before conducting the search. (ibid.; see samson, supra, 547 u.s. at p. 856, fn. 5; people v. sanders (2003) 31 cal.4th 318, 333; people v. middleton (2005) 131 cal.app.4th 732, 73without such advance knowledge, a search cannot rightly be justified as a [parole search], for the officer does not act pursuant to the search condition.douglas, at p. 862; see sanders, at p. 333; middleton, at p. 738.) permitting the police to use a parole search condition to justify a search when an officer is status would encourage unlawful police conduct, especially in neighborhoods where a higher than average number of persons are on probation or parole. (see sanders, at p. 336; people v. robles (2000) 23 cal.4th 789, 800.) a search founded on neither reasonable suspicion of criminal activity nor advance knowledge of parole status is arbitrary.
