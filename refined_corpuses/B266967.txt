(see people v. wilson (b102159; filed on april 25, 1997 [nonpub. opn.].) in december 2012, wilson filed a petition for resentencing under proposition 36. he argued that he was eligible and resentencing would not pose an unreasonable risk of danger to 1 all further statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise stated. 3 public safety. the people opposed the motion, arguing that resentencing wilson would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety based on his violent criminal history, prison misconduct, and lack of rehabilitative programming. wilson filed a reply arguing that based on his age (55 years old), the remoteness of his criminal offenses, his substantially compliant behavior in prison over the past 20 years, and his post-release plans, he did not pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. on june 2, 2015, the court held a hearing and heard evidence and argument regarding the petition. the people record while incarcerated. the trial court denied the petition after finding that resentencing petitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. in support of this finding, the court cited to misconduct in prison, and lack of meaningful self-help wilson timely appealed. contentions dangerousness determinations under proposition 36, and the trial court erred in not considering his petition under this definition.2 2 in the reply, for the first time, wilson raises the argument it is well-settfirst time in a reply brief will ordinarily not be considered, because such consideration would deprive the respondent of an reichardt v. 4 discussion 1. statutory interpretation the issues raised by wilson require us to interpret proposition 36 and proposition 47. initiative . . . we apply the same principles that govern statutory the statutory language must also be construed in the context of the statute as a whole and the overall statutory scheme [in light particularly the analyses and arguments contained in the official [citation.] primary purpose is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the people v. briceno (2004) 34 cal.4th 451, 459.) when the language is not ambiguous, the plain meaning of the statutory language controls, unless it would lead to absurd results the electorate could not have intended. (people v. birkett (1999) 21 cal.4th 226, 231.) furthermore, although courts may not generally rewrite a erroneously used may be subject to judicial correction in order to best carry out the intent of the adopting body. (people v. skinner (1985) 39 cal.3d 765, 775.) hoffman (1997) 52 cal.app.4th 754, 764.) however, we note that people v. garcia (2014) 230 cal.app.4th 763 has persuasively addressed and rejected this argument. 5 2. proposition 36 its amendment by [proposition 36], the three strikes law required that a defendant who had two or more prior convictions of violent or serious felonies receive a third strike sentence of a minimum of 25 years to life for any current felony conviction, even if the current offense was neither serious nor violent. (former  667, subds. (d), (e)(2)(a), 1170.12, subds. (b), (c)(2)(a).) [proposition 36] amended the three strikes law with respect to defendants whose current conviction is for a felony that is neither serious nor violent. in that circumstance, unless an exception applies, the defendant is to receive a second strike sentence of twice the term otherwise provided for the current felony, pursuant to the provisions that apply when a defendant has one prior conviction for a serious or violent felony. people v. johnson (2015) 61 cal.4th 674, 680681, fn. omitted.) proceeding whereby a prisoner who is serving an indeterminate life sentence imposed pursuant to the three strikes law for a crime that is not a serious or violent felony and who is not disqualified, may have his or her sentence recalled and be sentenced as a second strike offender unless the court determines that resentencing would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to people v. yearwood (2013) 213 cal.app.4th 161, 168.) in determining whether the petitioner would pose an consincluding the type of crimes committed, the extent of injury to victims, the length of prior prison commitments, and the 6 record and record of rehabilitation while incarcerated; and [] (3) any other evidence the court, within its discretion, determines to be relevant in deciding whether a new sentence would result in 1170.126, subd.

(see people v. rivera (2015) 233 canonviolent crimes like petty theft and drug possession, unless the defendant has prior convictions for specified violent or serious who is currently serving a sentence for any of the offenses listed thorough review of criminal history and risk assessment of any individuals before resentencing to ensure that they do not pose a 4, 2014) text of prop. 47,  3, subd.

[] (3) any other evidence the court, within its discretion, determines to be relevant in deciding whether a new sentence would result in an unreasonable risk of danger to public s 1170.18, subd. (b).) in contrast to proposition 36, which does not define the means an unreasonable risk that the petitioner will commit a new violent felony within the meaning of [section 667, subd. subd. (c).) section 667, subdivision (e)(2)(c)(iv) lists the following section 288a, sodomy . . . as defined by section 286, or sexual penetration . . . as defined by section 289.

(see, e.g., people v. valencia (2014) 232 cal.app.4th 514, review granted february 18, 2015, s223825; people v. chaney (2014) 231 cal.app.4th 1391, review granted february 18, 2015, s223676; people v. florez (2016) 245 cal.app.4th 1176, review granted june 8, 2016, s234168; people v. myers (2016) 245 cal.app.4th 794, review granted may 25, 2016, s233937; 9 people v. garcia (2016) 244 cal.app.4th 224, review granted april 13, 2016, s232679; people v. lopez (2015) 236 cal.app.4th 518, review granted july 15, 2015, s227028.) we conclude, consistent with the majority of courts to have considered this constitutional construction which mandates that courts, in construing a measure, not undertake to rewrite its unambiguous language. [citation.] that rule is not applied, however, when it appears clear that a word has been erroneously used, and a judicial correction will best carry out the intent of the adopting body. [citation.] . . . . whether the use of [a particular word] is, in fact, a drafting error can only be determined by reference to the purpose of the section and the intent of the electorate in people v. skinner, supra, 39 cal.3d at pp. 775776.) for the reasons that follow, we conclude that the voters subjected to judicial correction. specifically, as we now discuss, we believe the voters intended in section 1170.18, subdivision (c) to refer to proposition 47, not to the entire penal code. we therefore conclude that the passage of proposition 47 did not alter proposition 36 or section 1170.126. first, proposition 4and related sections is intended to diminish or abrogate the finality of judgments in any case not falling within the purview of 10 this acta proposition 36 petition must grant the petition unless it finds an unreasonaunder the restrictive definition provided by section 1170.18, subdivision (c), the finality of the underlying judgment may be purview of [pid.,  1170.18, subd. (n).) likewise, the official title and summary, legal analysis, and arguments for and against proposition 47 nowhere suggest that proposition 47 will have an impact on proposition 36. (voter information guide, supra, pp. 3439.) the ballot materials do not, for example, say that proposition 47 will severely restrict the ability of courts to reject resentencing petitions under proposition 36. rather, the ballot materials emphasize that the resentencing provisions of proposition 47 will affect only those persons serving sentences for specified nonserious, nonviolent property or drug suggests that the initiative will affect resentencing under proposition 36. furthermore, propositions 36 and 47 have different purposes. proposition 36 is designed to reduce penalties for individuals with two or more prior serious or violent felony convictions, whose current conviction is also a felony. by contrast, proposition 47 is intended to reduce penalties for low-guide, supra, p. 35.) the wording of section 1170.18, subdivision (c) is also inconsistent with an intent to apply that subdivision throughout 11 term that is used throughout proposition 47 to refer to persons 18, individuals petitioning under that particular act. (id.,  1170.18, sub. (c).) lastly, the timing of proposition 47 is inconsistent with an intent to affect proposition 36 petitions. proposition 36 required defendants to file petitions within two years from its enactment absent a showing of good cause for a late petition. ( 1170.126, subd. (b).) proposition 47 was enacted with only two days remaining in the two-year period for filing proposition 36 petitions. a rational voter would not have understood proposition 47 to change the rules for proposition 36 petitions when the period for filing such petitions had almost expired. on these grounds, we conclude that section 1170.18, subdivision (c) contains a drafting errorthe use of the word ger 12 disposition the order is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports edmon, p. j. we concur: lavin, j. goswami* * judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
