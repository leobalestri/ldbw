(a)) and admitted serving seven prior prison terms (pen. code,  667.5, subd. (b)), in exchange for dismissal of a felony first degree residential burglary charge (pen. code,  459) and an 11-year prison sentence. a little more than a year later, california voters passed proposition 47 ; pen. code,  1170.18), which reduced certain theft- and drug-related felonies to misdemeanors. defendant petitioned under proposition 47 to recall his sentence and have his felony drug possession conviction reduced to a misdemeanor. the people opposed his petition, contending that resentencing would deny them the benefit of their plea bargain. the trial court in effect denied the petition, finding that if it were to grant the petition, defendant would have to withdraw his plea so as to permit the people to reinstate the dismissed burglary charge. defendant declined to do so and brought this appeal. we reverse. factual and procedural background in april 2013, an information was filed charging defendant with first degree residential burglary (pen. code,  459) and possession of a controlled substance (health & saf. code,  11377, subd. (a)). it was also alleged that defendant had served several prior prison terms, and had suffered convictions for serious and violent felonies, three of -(j), 1170.12.) trial commenced on october 25, 2013. on october 29, 2013, defendant withdrew his guilty plea, entered a no contest plea to the drug possession charge, and admitted seven prior prison terms. on december 5, 2013, defendant was sentenced to a total term of 11 years in prison, consisting of four years for the drug possession and seven years for his prison priors. the burglary charge was dismissed according to the plea agreement. on november 17, 2014, defendant filed a petition for modification of his sentence under proposition 47, seeking to have his felony drug possession conviction reduced to a misdemeanor. on december 22, 2014, the people orally opposed the petition, on the 3 defendant were granted proposition 47 relief, he would have to withdraw his plea, and have the dismissed burglary charge reinstated. the court continued the hearing and proposition 47 relief] and are prepared to retry [defendant] if he wants to withdraw his plea 47 which means the people are also entitled to the benefit of their bargain under the law, which means since he was charged with other counts, he can be at this point in time since the people want to retry the case i will allow him to withdraw his plea, and people can re- court continued the hearing so the parties could file briefs addressing the issue. on march 3, 2015, defendant filed his brief, arguing that plea agreements incorporate future changes in the law, and that there was no basis for withdrawal of the plea. on march 30, 2015, the people filed a motion to vacate the plea, and to reinstate all charges against defendant, in the event the court decided to grant the proposition 47 petition. the people, relying on people v. collins (1978) 21 cal.3d 208 (collins), argued n under proposition 47 would provide defendant with where the people gave up the strike. [] and it seems to me to be something different than the other cases i have seen with prop 47 where there are other counts and the d.a., something like a strike and to avoid a strike. [] and that is where this court is feeling that collins and to allow the defendant, if he still chooses to follow through with the prop 47 petition, to allow him to withdraw the plea. [] . . . [] . . . [i]f [defendant] would like to continue forward his request under prop 47, i would grant him the plea to withdraw his plea, putting both parties in the same position as they were before sentence, and the people would not oppose a later application under proposition 47 to 4 have his conviction reduced to a misdemeanor. defense counsel requested a continuance to consult with defendant. on september 14, 2015, defendant filed a notice of appeal from the august 17, and requested a certificate of probable cause. his request for a certificate of probable cause was denied by the court. discussion i. appealability the people contend this appeal must be dismissed because defendant neither obtained a final ruling on his petition for resentencing, nor obtained a certificate of probable cause. we find no merit in these contentions. a certificate of probable cause is not required to appeal post-plea matters that do not affect the validity of the plea, such as those raised on appeal here. (pen. code,  1237.5; see also cal. rules of court, rule 8.304(b)(4)proposition 47 relief, when it conditioned proposition 47 relief on the withdrawal of on his willingness to withdraw his plea. this was clearly an adverse ruling, preserving (see, e.g., people v. rowland (1992) 4 cal.4th 238, 259.) ii. merits for resentencing under proposition 47. (pen. code,  1170.18, subd. (a).) the question is proposition 47 relief allows the people to withdraw from the plea agreement and reinstate the dismissed charge. there is a split of authority among the courts of appeal on this issue, and it is currently pending before our supreme court. (see, e.g., harris v. superior court (2015) 5 242 cal.app.4th 244, 255, review granted feb. 24, 2016, s231489 [holding that reduction of a plea-bargained felony charge under proposition 47 deprives the people of the benefit of the plea bargain, entitling the people to withdraw from the plea and reinstate the previously dismissed charges]; compare with people v. gonzalez (2016) 244 cal.app.4th 1058, 1067, 1068-1071, review granted apr. 27, 2016, s233219 [finding that plea agreements are subject to changes in the law which may modify or invalidate the terms of a plea agreement, and that in enacting proposition 47, voters intended to affect the sentences of offenders notwithstanding that their convictions were by plea agreement, and that proposition 47 provides no basis for reinstatement of dismissed counts]; accord people v. perry (2016) 244 cal.app.4th 1251, 1258, review granted apr. 27, 2016, s233287 [same]; people v. brown (2016) 244 cal.app.4th 1170, 1179, review granted apr. 27, 2016, s233274 [same].) we find the reasoning in people v. gonzalez, supra, persuasive. plea agreements are deemed to incorporate future changes in the law. compliance with changes in the law made retroactive to them does not violate the terms of the plea agreement . . . .doe v. harris (2013) 57 cal.4th 64, 73-74.) proposition sentence for a conviction, whether by trial or plea . . . pen. code,  1170.18, subd. (a), italics added.) proposition 47 makes resentencing mandatoryrequirements. ( 1170.18, subd. (b).) relief may only be denied if an otherwise eligible id., subd. (b)(3).) nothing in proposition 47 provides a basis for the people to withdraw a plea reliance on collins, supra, is misplaced. in that case, the defendant pled guilty, and before he was sentenced, the legislature decriminalized the crime to which he had entered a plea. nevertheless, the trial court sentenced defendant according to the negotiated plea. the supreme court reversed, finding the conviction was without legal basis, but remanded to allow the people to revive the dismissed charges, finding guilty plea or otherwise succeeds in attacking it, counts dismissed pursuant to a plea 6 collins, supra, 21 cal.3d at pp. 211, 213, 215.) here, defendant did not ask to withdraw his plea, and he has not attacked it; he has availed himself of a voter-approved mechanism for resentencing. moreover, unlike the defendant in collins. for these reasons, we find that the trial court erred in conditioning proposition 47 agreement to withdraw his plea. defendant is eligible for recall of pose an (3).) disposition the order denying the petition is reversed, and the matter is remanded to the trial proposition 47 relief under penal code section 1170.18, subdivision (b)(3). grimes, j. we concur: rubin, acting p. j. flier, j.
