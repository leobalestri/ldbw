(see people v. gonzales (2017) 2 cal.5th 858, 863.) new section 1170.18, added by proposition 47, permits an eligible defendant serving a felony sentence for one of the enumerated theft or drug offenses to petition for recall of sentence and resentencing under the new, more lenient provisions. ( 1170.18, subds. (a), (b).) a person who has already completed a felony sentence for an offense that is now a misdemeanor may apply to have his or her conviction designated a misdemeanor. ( 1170.18, subds. (f), (g); see gonzales, at p. 863.) proposition 47 also added several provisions to the penal code, including section 459.5, which created the crime of shoplifting. section 459.5, subdivision (a), provides, shoplifting is defined as entering a commercial establishment with intent to commit larceny while that establishment is open during regular business hours, where the value of the property that is taken or intended to be taken does not exceed nine hundred fifty dollars ($950). any other entry into a commercial establishment with intent to commit larceny is burglary. shoplifting shall be punished as a misdemeanor . . . 2 burglary conviction as shoplifting, the trial court found the value of the stolen laptop computer was more than $950. mendoza 2 room, . . . store . . . or other building . . . with intent to commit is not of an inhabited dwelling. ( 460.) 4 ed by substantial evidence. mendoza is correct that nothing in the record established the value of the stolen computer. indeed, at the time of was not an element of the offense. because mendoza was also charged with felony grand theft, defined at the time as unlawfully taking money or personal property valued in excess of disposition program report. however, that document is not part of the record on appeal.3 similarly, although mendoza was ordered to pay restitution to the boeing company, the record order reflecting a subsequent award of victim restitution. conevidence that the value of the stolen laptop computer exceeded $950 does not entitle him to proposition 47 relief. it was less, not the peoplethat sum. (people v. romanowski (2017) 2 cal.5th 903, 917.) mendoza failed to carry his burden. the application for reclassification of his burglary conviction consisted of a single 3 after repeated requests to the superior court clerk to augment the record, culminating in this determination that the offense was not subject to s informed by the clerk that the court file for the case could not be located. in containing documents that had not been lost. 5 standardized form on which he checked a series of boxes stating  459 2nd burglary ineligible under section 1170.18 for the requested relief. the application provided no information about the laptop computer, let alone any evidence of its value. court with the information necessary for it to determine his eligibility for reclassification, under the circumstances we do not affirm filed his application for proposition 47 relief in february 2015, it was unclear who had the burden of establishing the value of a stolen item. section 1170.18 is silent on this point. the first published appellate case holding the party seeking relief under proposition 47 had the initial burden of proof as to eligibility was not decided until august 2015. (see people v. sherow (2015) 239 cal.app.4th 875, 879-880.)4 furthermore, the standard form application that mendoza completed did not require him to state a factual basis for the valuation of the laptop computer. accordingly, the appropriate disposition here is to vacate the trial able to do so in good faith, to file an amended application that provides the necessary factual information to establish eligibility for relief under sections 459.5 and 1170.18. (see e.g. people v. sweeney (2016) 4 cal.app.5th 295, 302-303; people v. perkins (2016) 244 cal.app.4th 129, 141; sherow, at p. 881.) specifically, 4 in people v. gonzales, supra, 2 cal.5th at page 875 and more recently in people v. romanowski, supra, 2 cal.5th at page demonstrate his or her eligibility for relief. 6 mendoza must show the value of the stolen laptop computer was $950 or less and it was taken from a commercial establishment that was open during regular business hours at the time of the theft. disposition the april 2, 2015 order denying the application for vacated. the matter is remanded for the trial court to give mendoza leave to file an amended application as directed in this opinion. perluss, p. j. we concur: zelon, j. bensinger, j.* * judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
