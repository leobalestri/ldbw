(see pen. code,  1170.126, subd. (e)(2), 667, subd. (e)(2)(c)(iii).)1 appellant contends that his conviction for possession of a firearm by a felon does not bar him from relief under proposition 36. we disagree and affirm. facts and proceedings below in 1997, a police officer saw appellant, a felon, riding his bicycle. when he made eye contact with the officer, appellant withdrew a handgun and held it in his hands. appellant then dropped the bicycle and ran. while scaling a fence to escape, appellant dropped the weapon. police arrested appellant and charged him with possession of a firearm by a felon, in violation of former section 12021, subdivision (a)(1).2 a jury found appellant guilty and also found that he had two prior strike convictions. the court sentenced him under the three strikesaw to an indeterminate term of 25 years to life.3 in 2012, appellant filed a petition for recall of his sentence under proposition 36, which provides for relief from indeterminate life sentences under the three strikes law for inmates currently serving sentences for nonviolent, nonserious felonies. ( 1170.126.) the people opposed the petition,4 arguing that appellant was ineligible for relief because he was armed during the commission of his offense (see  1170.126, subd. (e)(2)). the trial court agreed and denied the petition. appellant timely appealed. 1 unless otherwise specified, all further statutory references are to the penal code. 2 in 2010, the legislature repealed section 12021 and replaced it with section 29800. 3 people v. campbell (mar. 23, 1999, b119557) [nonpub. opn.].) 4 the people supported the opposition with excerpts of the transcript from 3 discussion appellant argues that his conviction for possession of a firearm by a felon is not a crime excluded from eligibility for resentencing under proposition 36, and thus, the court erred when it deemed him ineligible for resentencing. we disagree. under section 1170.126, an inmate serving an indeterminate life sentence under upon conviction . . . of a felony or felonies that are not defined as serious and/or violent felonies . . . may file a petition for a recall o(id., subd. (b).) subdivision (e)(2) of section 1170.126 creates an exception, providing that an inmate serving a sentence for an offense described in section 667, subdivision (e)(2)(c) is not eligible for resentencing. among the offenses described in ing the commission of the current offense, the defendant used a firearm, was armed with a firearm or deadly weapon, or intended to cause gre ( 667, subd. (e)(2)(c)(iii) (subdivision (iii)).) the trial court found appellant ineligible for resentencing under subdivision (iii) because he was armed with a firearm during the commission of the possession offense. appellant does not deny he possessed a firearm. he contends, however, that possession of a firearm does not preclude him from eligibility for resentencing under proposition 36. arming is an element of the offense; he insists that the arming to the current offense as an addition and not just be an element in addition, appellant asserts that in subdivision (iii), it must be construed to require that the weapon be available for use in furtherance of the commission of the [current] offense that is the subject of the recall (italics omitted.) this, in turn, according to the appellant, requires that the arming of the weapon facilitates the commission of the offense lack merit. aunderlying premisethat ment of his current offense of firearm possessionis wrong. 4 (people v. blakely (2014) 225 cal.app.4th 1042, 1052.) a defendant can constructively possess a firearm dominion and controlwithout actually possessing it. (people v. osuna (2014) 225 cal.app.4th 1020, 1030 (osuna) ut it being people v. elder (2014) 227 cal.app.4th 1308, 1313-1314 (elder) every commitment offense for unlawful possession of a gun necessarily involves being armed with the gun, if the gun is not otherwise available for immediate use in connection with its possession, e.g.s dominion and control in a location not readily accessible to him at the time of its discovery].) in addition, appellate courts have rejected interpretation of subdivision (iii) as requiring a current offense to which the arming or to which it hfacilitative nexus. (see people v. brimmer (2014) 230 cal.app.4th 782, 797 (brimmer); elder, supra, 227 cal.app.4th at pp. 13121314; osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at pp. 1030-1032; people v. white (2014) 223 cal.app.4th 512, 525.) as the court in osuna recognized, this interpretation of subdivision (iii) draws an analogy to the case law construing the section 12022, subdivision (a)(1) sentencing enhancement armed with a firearm in the commission of (osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1032; see brimmer, supra, 230 cal.app.4th at pp. 794-795 [holding that the section 12022 enhancement applies only if the gun has a facilitative nexus with the underlying offense (i.e., it serves some purpose in connection with it)]; accord people v. bland (1995) 10 cal.4th 991, 1001-1003 (bland).) the analogy to the section 12022 sentencing enhancement, however, does not withstand scrutiny. proposition 36 turns on whether the defendant was armed [d]uring ubd. (c)(2)(c)(iii), 667, subd. (e)(2)(c)(iii), 1170.126, subd. (e)(2), italics added)not, as with the in , italics added). is variously defined as 5 t some [citation.] in other words, it requires a temporal nexus between the arming and the underlying felony, osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1029; see also elder, supra, 227 cal.app.4th at pp. 13121313 t provision with proposition 3s ineligibility provision].) as the court in osuna explained, this difference in language is significant.5 thus, the osuna armed with a firearm subdivision for use, either offensively or osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1029.) we agree. in accordance with other appellate courts that have examined this issue, we conclude that the language of subdivision (iii) disqualifies an inmate from resentencing under proposition 36 if he was armedhad a firearm available for use, either offensively or defensivelyat the time he committed the felony of illegal possession of a firearm. appellant both possessed a firearm and had it available for usehe held the firearm in his hands when police first sighted himcommission of the offense for the purposes of proposition 36. consequently, the trial court did not err when it denied recall of his sentence. 5 appellant assails the osuna pointing out that in bland in the commission and during the commission of the application of the section bland is misplaced. in bland, the court analyzed the application of the section 12022 enhancement in the context of a drug possession offense; the analysis did not require the court to parse and compare the meaning of the bland, supra, 10 cal.4th at pp. 1001-1003.) consequently, we discern no significance from the bland simultaneous use of those terms. 6 disposition the order of the trial court is affirmed. not to be published. rothschild, p. j. we concur: chaney, j. lui, j.
