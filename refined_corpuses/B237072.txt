(people v. arriaga (2011) 201 cal.app.4th 429, review granted feb. 12, 2012, s199339.) 2 at the plea hearing, among the rights and consequences that sharma initialed he not a citizen of the united states, i must expect my plea of guilty or no contest will result in my deportation, exclusion from admission or reentry to the united states, and denial of 3 on april 15, 2011, an immigration judge found sharma removable from the united states based upon his burglary conviction, a decision that was later confirmed by the board of immigration appeals. 3] or 4 sharma claimed he had received constitutionally inadequate advice from his retained counsel at the time, and the advisements required by penal code5 section 1016.5 did not precede entry of the plea.6 lawful permanent resident of the united states since 1984. he and his son were living with his parents. the trial court noted sharma had been given the advisements required by section 1016.5 and summarily denied the motion. sharma filed a timely notice of appeal. discussion sharma contends his plea was not knowing and voluntary because the advisements required by that section did not reflect the true immigration consequences and defense counsel failed to advise him of the section 1016.5 immigration consequences of his plea. 3 statutory motion, or otherwise address the basis for any coram nobis relief. we note that coram nobis will not issue to vacate a plea of guilty on the ground it was induced by ineffective assistance of counsel. (people v. gallardo (2000) 77 cal.app.4th 971, 982-983.) 4 the record contains no written opposition filed by the people. 5 all further statutory references are to the penal code, unless otherwise designated. 6 section 1016.5, subdivision (a) requires that, prior to acceptance of a plea of nolo administer the following advisement on the record to the defendant: if you are not a citizen, you are hereby advised that conviction of the offense for which you have been charged may have the consequences of deportation, exclusion from admission to the united states, or denial of naturalization pursuant to the laws of the united states 4 ement about immigration consequences is statutory, not constitutional. (people v. superior court (zamudio) (2000) 23 cal.4th 183, 194.) the underlying purpose of section 1016.5 is to ensure the defendant has actual knowledge of the possible adverse immigration consequences of a guilty or no contest plea and has had an opportunity to make an intelligent choice to plead guilty or no contest. (id. at pp. 193-194; people v. gutierrez (2003) 106 cal.app.4th 169, 173.) section 1016.5, a defendant must establish that (1) he or she was not properly advised of the immigration consequences as provided by the statute; (2) there exists, at the time of the motion, more than a remote possibility that the conviction will have one or more of the specified adverse immigration consequences; and (3) he or she was prejudiced by (people v. castro-vasquez (2007) 148 cal.app.4th 1240, 1244.) we review the denial of a motion to vacate under section 1016.5 for abuse of discretion. (zamudio, supra, 23 cal.4th at p. 192.) on appeal, sharma does not dispute he was advised by the trial court of the immigration consequences as required by section 1016.5. instead, sharma contends, despite this advisement, he did not understand the immigration consequences of his plea and, had he understood, he would have sought a different plea bargain or would have taken the case to trial. sharma asserts he pleaded no contest to an offense that constitutes of the three immigration consequences mentioned in the section 1016.5 advisements, namely deportation, exclusion from admission and denial of naturalization.7 sharma 7 first degree residential burglary constitutes an aggravated felony for immigration convicted of an aggravated felony is conclusively presumed to be removable (8 u.s.c.  1228(c)), is subject to immediate removal (8 u.s.c.  1227(a)(2)(a)(iii)), is permanently inadmissible to the united states (8 u.s.c.  1182(a)(9)(a)(i)), and is permanently barred from establishing good moral character for naturalization purposes (8 u.s.c.  1101(f)(8)). 5 maintains the statute, as currently worded, leads a defendant, who is an alien, to believe that a no contest plea would subject him or her to only one of these immigration that because an alien convicted of an aggravated felony is subject to all three consequences, the section 1016.5 advisement misrepresents the actual immigration consequences of a no contest plea. sharma urges that the statute be amended to read, conviction which constitutes an aggravated felony under the immigration laws of the united states will have the consequences of deportation, exclusion from admission to the aim he did not enter a knowing and voluntary plea because the section 1016.5 advisement did not reflect his true immigration consequences is belied by the record. sharma ignores the fact that the section 1016.5 advisement as orally given by the trial couras stated in the conjunctive. sharma acknowledged both orally and in writing that he understood the section 1016.5 advisement conveyed to him. thus, the section 1016.5 advisement conveyed to sharma went beyond what the statute requires, by making sharma fully aware of the actual immigration consequences of his no contest plea. because sharma was given a proper section 1016.5 advisement, his additional people v. kim (2009) 45 cal.4th 1078, 1107, fn. 20; see people v. chien (2008) 159 cal.app.4th 1283, 1285.) the proper vehicle is a petition for writ of habeas corpus.
