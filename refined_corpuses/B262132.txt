(d)(1)) (count 1); forgery of a vehicle transfer form ( 470, subd. (d)) (count 2); forgery of an application for a duplicate or paperless title ( 470, subd. (d)) (count 3); and false personation ( 529, subd. (a)(2)) (count 4). the d.a. also alleged cardenas had been convicted of a serious felony under section 667, subdivisions (b) through (j) and section 1170.12, and had been incarcerated for five terms within the meaning of section 667.5, subdivision (b). cardenas entered a nolo contendere plea under west, supra, 3 cal.3d 595, to count 2, forgery of a vehicle transfer form. after finding a factual basis for the plea, the court sentenced cardenas to a total of 32 months in state prison. on november 18, 2014, cardenas filed a motion for resentencing under prop 47. of documents related to vehicles, he was ineligible for resentencing. cardenas appealed. 3 discussion on appeal, cardenas contends the record of conviction does not render him ineligible for sentencing. we disagree. a. cardenas bears the burden of proof to demonstrate resentencing eligibility although prop 47 does not allocate the burden of proof to demonstrate resentencing eligibility, appellate courts have placed the burden on the defendant. (people v. sherow (2015) 239 cal.app.4th 875, 878 (sherow); people v. rivas-colon (2015) 241 cal.app.4th 444, 449 (rivas-colon), quoting sherow; people v. ortiz (2016) 243 cal.app.4th 854, 861, citing sherow; people v. perkins (2016) 244 cal.app.4th 129, 136, quoting sherow and citing rivas-colon.) we agree with allocating the burden to the defendant. as the sherow couit is a rational allocation of burdens if the s the burden of showing (sherow, at p. 878.) cardenas acknowledges this precedent, but contends consistent line of cases, such as people v. guerrero (1988) 44 cal.3d 343 (guerrero) and people v. watts (2005) 131 cal.app.4th 589, which hold be for the least offense possible, and here, the least offense possible would create eligibility. cardenas misapplies guerrero and watts. the presumption there is that, in the trikes context, if it cannot be determined from the record that the offense was committed in a way that would make it a strike, an offense is presumed to be the least offense possible. (watts, at p. 596, italics omitted.) by its own terms, that presumption does not apply until after a review of the record. as explained below, the even if potentially applicable in this context, does not apply here. b. cardenas argues that the court is limited to his record of conviction in determining his resentencing eligibility and his west plea limited the record of conviction to the bare that the court 4 is limited to his record of conviction because the record of conviction alone demonstrates cardenas ineligibility for resentencing. 1. west plea does not limit the record of conviction to the bare elements of his forgery offense cardenas tries to limit the record of conviction to the bare elements of his forgery offense because he pleaded nolo contendere, or no contest, to the offense under west, supra, 3 cal.3d 595. when entering a west plea, a defendant agrees to plead guilty to an offense, but does not admit to the alleged factual basis. (in re alvernaz (1992) 2 cal.4th 924, 932.) cardenas argues that when he entered his west plea, he was only the bare elements of a forgery offense do not specify the type of falsified writing. (see pen. code,  470; people v. castellanos (2003) 110 cal.app.4th 1489, 1493, quoting caljic no. 15.00.) under section 470, subdivision (d), forgeries of only certain types of writings create eligibility. ( 470, subd. (d) [forgery of a certificate of ownership or other document does not create eligibility];  473, subd. (b).) cardenas argues, in essence, that the court erred in looking to the information in determining what type of documents cardenas forged because the type of writing is not an element of the crime but rather is a fact, and one to which he did not admit. cardenas, however, failed to cite a single case where a court limited the record of conviction to the bare elements of the offense. in fact, his only cite, guerrero, supra, 44 cal.3d 343, actually supports review of the entire record of conviction. granted, guerrero is not precisely on point because in guerrero the defendant was convicted after a jury trial and the issue on appeal was whether the court, in determining the truth of a prior conviction allegation, could look beyond the prior judgment of conviction to the entire record of conviction. (guerrero at p. 345.) the guerrero court, however, concluded courts may the entire record of the conviction in that context. (id. at p. 355, italics added.) specifically, furthers the evident intent of the people in establishing an enhancement for, 5 what was at issue in guerrero, a term that refers to conduct, not a specified crime. (ibid.) prop 47 likewise identifies types of conduct rather than types of crime because without the propositionforgeries as felonies, all forgeries would be of the same type of crime regardless of the underlying conduct. in adopting prop 47-based categorizations, the people evidently intended the conduct of forging vehicle transfer papers to remain a felony. a plea to simply a forgery, however, would not disclose whether the underlying facts about made the forgery a misdemeanor or a felony because it involved vehicle transfer papers. without intent to distinguish forgeries based on conduct would be subverted. another factor weighs in favor of not limiting the record. prop 47 permits a court, deny a petition and in deciding so may use a number of sources of information, including determines to be relevant. (voter information guide, gen. elec. (nov. 4, 2014) text of prop. 47,  14, p. 74.) although the public danger exception is not applicable here, the nature of this exception speaks to the information necessary to make a proper judgment about whether to resentence an offender. limiting the record of conviction to the bare elements of the defense does not further this goal. 2. the record of conviction includes the accusatory pleading and supports ineligibility the record of conviction includes the accusatory pleading. (people v. washington (2012) 210 cal.app.4th 1042, 1045 (washington), citing people v. abarca (1991) 233 cal.app.3d 1347, 1350.) here, in count 2 of the information, the d.a. specifically alleged cardenas the record of conviction also includes a guilty plea. (washington, supra, 210 cal.app.4th at p. 1045is treated as a guilty plea in subsequent criminal proceedings. (people v. rauen (2011) 201 cal.app.4th 421, 6 425.) although a nolo contendere plea removes the threat of collateral estoppelcivil suit, [t]he legislature did not provide for a similar exclusion of the collateral use of a conviction based on a plea of nolo contendere in criminal actions. the full use of the criminal conviction based on a plea of nolo contendere in later criminal actions was neither prohibited by the legislature nor is it constitutionally compelled(id. at pp. 425426, quoting people v. chagolla (1984) 151 cal.app.3d 1045, 10481049.) cardenas does not dispute his plea, and we therefore give it the full effect of a guilty plea, including any criminal collateral consequences. cardenas was ineligible for resentencing because the information in his record of conviction specified he had forged documents relating to the ownership of a vehicle and he pleaded nolo contendere, which we consider here as guilty, to that charge. disposition the order is affirmed. not to be published. lui, j. we concur: chaney, acting p. j. johnson, j.
