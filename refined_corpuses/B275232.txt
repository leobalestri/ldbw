filed 10/10/17 p. v. hernandez ca2/2 not to be published in the official reports california rules of court, rule 8.1115(a), prohibits courts and parties from citing or relying on opinions not certified for publication or ordered published, except as specified by rule 8.1115(b). this opinion has not been certified for publication or ordered published for purposes of rule 8.1115. in the court of appeal of the state of california second appellate district division two the people, plaintiff and respondent, v. david daniel hernandez, defendant and appellant. b275232 (los angeles county super. ct. no. va131458) appeal from a judgment of the superior court of los angeles county. john a. torribio, judge. affirmed as modified. siri shetty, under appointment by the court of appeal, for defendant and appellant. xavier becerra, attorney general, gerald a. engler, chief assistant attorney general, lance e. winters, assistant attorney general, stacy s. schwartz and tannaz kouhpainezhad, deputy attorneys general, for plaintiff and respondent. _________________________ 2 a jury convicted david daniel hernandez (appellant) of attempted murder (pen. code,  664/187, subd. (a)).1 it found true the allegations that the offense was committed for the benefit of a criminal street gang ( 186.22, subd. (b)(1)), and that appellant personally used a deadly and dangerous weapon ( 12022, subd. (b)(1)). in a separate proceeding, the trial court found true the allegation that appellant suffered two prior serious convictions ( 667, subd. (a)(1)). appellant was sentenced to a state prison term of 45 years to life as follows: 25 years to life, plus 10 years for violation of section 186.22, subdivision (b)(1) in the commission of a violent felony ( 186.22, subd. (b)(1)(c)), and 10 years for the serious felony convictions. the trial court stayed the deadly weapon enhancement. on appeal, appellant challenges his attempted murder conviction on the ground that two undercover deputy sheriffs posed as gang members in his jail cell and coerced his confession by asserting that the authorities had a strong case against appellant, and by implying that they could help him hire a private defense attorney if he told them about the crime. also, appellant contendsand the people concedethat we should reverse his 10-year gang enhancement ( 186.22, subd. (b)(1)(c)) given that he received a life sentence and is therefore subject to a minimum parole eligibility of 15 years ( 186.22, subd. (b)(5)). upon review, we conclude that appelcoerced. we modify the judgment to omit the gang enhancement, and to impose the minimum parole eligibility of 15 years provided by section 186.22, subdivision (b)(5). as modified, the judgment is affirmed. 1 all further statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise indicated. 3 facts background the pico viejo gang has approximately 174 documented members, 28 of whom are active. wagon wheel is a bar within murders, violent assaults, robberies, burglaries, identity theft, possession of guns and weapons, and the sale of drugs. appellant is an admitted member of the pico viejo gang, and is known by the moniker ss. isaac galindo, who goes by the monike is a shot caller, i.e., a veteran gang member who makes decisions for the gang. a ricardo jauregui (jauregui) and jose luis vargas (vargas) are long time patrons of wagon wheel. they are friends with a woman named joann marie lieras (lieras). in the beginning of july 2013, jauregui complained to vargas about people using drugs at wagon wheel. the attempted murder on july 17, 2013, a man with a hoodie approached jauregui, who was sitting at struck his head eight times with a hammer. appellant was arrested for the crime. in august 2013, anthony castro (castro) and dillon navarro (navarro) were deputies with the los angeles county custody division. dressed like gang members, they were placed in the jail cell where appellant was being held. 4 early on, castro told appellant that jail officials could not . . . . . . using the restrooms or anything, so if they shut the water off, he said if the water was for a lawyer? the conversation continued as follows: appellant]: no, i have family. castro]: appellant]: how much does your lawyer cost? castro]: well, ours is paid through our [kitty], like our guy runs that. . . .

[] . . . like we talked about earlier. you know what we talked about. what did we talk about? appellant]: that attempted murder charge[?] male officer]: after the male officer left, appellant, castro and navarro continued talking. castro said the police had appellant on video, they had the hammer and a snitch, and they had witnesses. appellant again asked if castro and navarro could recommend their lawyer. castro re[anything] for free[.]on the heels of that, castro told appellant, the appellant explained that his was, and then to fire his attorney and then to represent himself. he went on to explain that he had represented himself in connection with a prior case. later, castro suggested if appellant hired booker, he might advise appellant to take a deal. castro asked what kind of deal appellant would be willing to take. he said he would take 10 years. 9 navarro was escorted out of the cell. when he returned, he indicated that he spoke to his brother on the phone, and that his brother had called booker. navarro represented that booker said he would visit them in county jail that day or the next. the three men proceeded to talk about a variety of topics such as selling drugs. money . . . fool? heyoh man, if you get me out . . . he said he could come up with $5,000. this prompted castro to say they liked to work with people they could trust. he added that know the rest of your homies the following exchange ensued: castro]: trust. and so youable to help you. . . .

[] . . . [] i bet you anything he could . . . find a , if for us. castro definitely hook you up with our lawyer, and we can help you out . . . [problems] with your case, our to 12 castro said he did not want appellant to lie about his case because it would cost them money and the lawyer could not help when asked by castro, appellant admitted that he burned his clothes and the hammer, and there was no dna. queried whether he they started talking about selling drugs, and appellant ne of . . . between being a hit man and selling drugs. appellant said he preferred to sell drugs because being a hit man came with consequences. . . . appellant g to do for he asked if castro and navarro were going to try and rescue him. castro said he would call booker and have him send an associate. number. appellant recited it. jailhouse statements defense counsel moved to exclude the statements appellant made to castro and navarro on the ground that they had been obtained through coercion or improper psychological force. in particular, defense counsel noted that castro and navarro led appellant to believe they would retain private counsel for him. 13 the trial court pointed out that appellant made incriminating admissions before the alleged coercive conduct began. the motion was denied. evidence appellant was at wagon wheel; evidence he was the assailant the prosecutor played a portion of the transcript of navarro for the jury. lieras testified that she arrived at wagon wheel at about 3:30 or 4:30 p.m. she bought a beer and went to the bathroom. as she exited, she encountered a shirtless young man who was a large his stomach. he said, she told him to get out of the way. later, lieras saw the same man ? put your shirt lydia gonzalez (gonzalez), a bartender at wagon wheel, started work 5:00 p.m. she saw appellant and smiley. appellant told gonzalez he had gotten a job. later that evening, gonzalez patio. appellant sometimes came into the bar to buy beer. at about 8:00 or 8:30 p.m., lieras was sitting on a bar stool with vargas to her left and jauregui to her right. out the window she could see a man wearing a hoodie. based on his height and build, she thought it was the same person she had encountered after leaving the bathroom. right before the attack on jauregui, lieras noticed smiley by the backdoor, and another gang member by the front door. assailant as five-140 pounds, and wearing a hoodie that covered his face. 14 at trial, lieras identified the shirtless man and the man with the hoodie she saw out the window as appellant. detective stephen valenzuela of the los angeles county that the attempted murder of jauregui was committed for the benefit of the pico viejo gang. discussion i. appellantconfession was not coerced. he fourteenth amendment of the federal constitution and article 1, section 15, of the state constitution bar the (people v. massie (1998) 19 cal.4th 550, 576.) before preponderance of the evidence that it was voluntary. (ibid.) a confession is voluntary unless there has been coercive police conduct, i.e., it was obtained through the use of threats, violence, direct or implied promises, or the exertion of improper influence. (people v. benson (1990 ) 52 cal.3d 754, 778.) the whether the confession was voluntary depends upon the totality of the circumstances. [citations.] as to the circumstances surrounding the confession are upheld if to the voluntariness of the confession is subject to independent people v. carrington (2009) 47 cal.4th 145, 169.) 15 when an undercover agent speaks to a suspect, the concerns underlying miranda v. arizona (1966) 384 u.s. 436 are not implicated. (illinois v. perkins (1990) 496 u.s. 292, 296 (illinois) -dominated incarcerated person speaks freely to someone that he believes to be a fellow inmate. coercion is determined from the perspective of the suspect. [citations.] when a suspect considers himself in the company of cellmates and not officers, the coercive atmosphere is lacking. [citation.] there is no empirical basis for the assumption that a suspect speaking to those whom he assumes are not officers will feel compelled to speak by the fear of reprisal for remaining silent or in the hope of more lenient treatment should he confess. according to appellant, we must reverse because castro and navarro secured a confession by conveying a false implied promise that they would help him obtain a private attorney if he told them about the crime. in other words, appellant contends that his confession was involuntary under the totality of the circumstances because his will was overborne by government deception. deception does not make a statement involuntary unless it is of a type reasonably likely to procure an untrue statement. (people v. williams (2010) 49 cal.4th 405, 443 (williams).) the deception used by castro and navarro does not qualify. appellant believed he was talking to fellow cell mates and gang members. as explained by the illinois does not know that he is speaking to a government agent there is no reason to assume the possibility that the suspect might feel illinois, supra, 496 u.s. at p. 299.) moreover, castro 16 and navarro never asked appellant to admit the crime. rather, they merely pressed for assurances that there were no problems with the case. we do not construe that as an implied request for an admission. even if it could be construed that way, an implied promise to help appellant was not likely to procure an untrue statement because appellant said he could raise $5,000 for a private attorney, he had the option of using a public defender, he indicated he had been incarcerated before, and he explained that his ultimate plan was to fire his attorney and represent himself, as he had done in the past. further, because castro and navarro said they wanted to trust appellant and work with him but thought he might not get out of jail if there were problems with his case, appellant had incentive to assure them he was not after appellant had already made inculpatory admissions, and those more overt promises were not likely to lead to an untrue statement. rather, they were likely to lead to statements consistent with what appellant had already said. we therefore do not perceive any likelihood the deception in this case violated constitutional principles. appellant notes that tactics used by undercover agents may, under certain circumstances, amount to coercion. (arizona v. fulminante (1991) 499 u.s. 279, 288 [due to a credible threat of violence against defendant unless he confessed, his confession was coerced by a jailhouse informantexchange for defendant talking about his crime].) he contends that leyra v. denno (1954) 347 u.s. 556 (leyra) provides the light to guide our opinion. 17 in leyra, the police questioned defendant for several days and nights to no avail. because the defendant was suffering from a painful sinus attack, a police captain offered to get a physician to help. the defendant was introduced to a psychiatrist. instead of giving medical le and tof the past days and nights to induce petitioner to admit his guilt. for an hour and a half or more the techniques of a highly trained o get him to say he had murdered his parents. time and time and time again the psychiatrist told petitioner how much he wanted to and could help him, how bad it would be for petitioner if he did not confess, and how much better he would feel, and how much lighter and easier it would be on him if he would just unbosom himself to the doctor. yet the doctor was at that very time the paid representative of the state whose prosecuting officials were listening in on every threat made and every promise of leniency given. [] . . . [] finally, after an hour and a half or longer, petitioner, encouraged by the doctors assurances that he had done no moral wrong and would be let off easily, called for [the captain]. the captain immediately appeared. it was then that the confession was given(leyra, supra, 347 u.s. at pp. 559560.) subsequently, the defendant gave a formal confession after talking to his business partner and two state prosecutors. (id. at p. 560.) a new york state court and a lower federal court concluded that though the first confession was the product of mental coercion, the formal confession was voluntary. the united states supreme court reversed. it reasoned that the first and second rocess. all 18 were extracted in the same place within a period of about five hours as the climax of days and nights of intermittent, [and] intensive police questioning. first, an already physically and emotionally exhausted suspects ability to resist interrogation was broken to almost trance-like submission by use of the arts of a highly skilled psychiatrist. then the confession petitioner began making to the psychiatrist was filled in and perfected by additional statements given in rapid succession to a police officer, leyra, supra, 347 u.s. at p. 561.) here, prior to appellant making his initial admissions, castro and/or navarro said they had a good private lawyer; they warned appellant that lying came with risk; they told appellant that he needed to hire a lawyer; was on the hammer; they suggested that an informant was talking to the police about the attempted murder; they said their attorney helped them defeat murder charges; they talked about the possibility that the crime had been captured on video; they said they would give appellant the number for their attorney; they indicated the police had a picture of the hammer and were talking and laughing about how they had witnesses. an the police did not need to talk to appellant anymore because they had police had appellant on video, and they had the hammer, a was setting him up for a fall; they explained that their lawyer would not represent appellant free; they said their attorney might recommend that appellant take a deal, and they asked him what kind of deal he would accept; they said that their 19 attorney would visit them in county jail that day or the next; they told appellant he could make some money when he got out of jail; they said they liked to work with people they could trust; they expressed concern that witnesses could place appellant at the scene of the crime; and they talked about having witnesses killed, after the foregoing, castro asked if appellant wore a mask. in response, appellant indicated that he had worn a mask, and gave the location of the hammer. when castro asked about he also explained that a camera was no problem because he had been wearing a hoodie. in addition, appellant said he burned everything. anything discussed by castro, navarro and appellant after these initial admissions was simply repetition and clarification of things said earlier. this is not a case in which a confession was extracted by promises of physical relief from pain or promises of leniency. thus, leyra is inapposite. next, appellant suggests that a reversal is dictated by people v. cahill (1994) 22 cal.app.4th 296 statements amounted to a threat if defendant did not confess, and promise of leniency if defendant did confess] and people v. vasila (1995) 38 cal.app.4th 865 [same]. but again, this case does not involve a promise of leniency. nonetheless, appellant suggests that the reasoning in these promise of leniency cases should apply to a case in which an undercover agent promises, or impliedly promises, some type of benefit or reward. there is no case law to support this suggestion, and we decline to create a 20 new rule. we conclude that the williams test is adequate to protect defendants in the deception context.3 ii. the 10-year gang enhancement must be reversed. when a defendant violates section 186.22, subdivision (b)(1) in the commission of a felony punishable by life in prison, the defendant shall not be paroled until a minimum of 15 calendar 186.22, subd. (b)(5).) a three strikes sentence of 25 years to life qualifies as a life sentence under section 186.22, subdivision (b)(5). (people v. williams (2014) 227 cal.app.4th 733, 744.) when a defendant is subject to the minimum parole eligibility provided by section 186.22, subdivision (b)(5), it should be imposed. in that situation, it is error for a trial court to instead impose a 10-year gang enhancement under section 186.22, subdivision (b)(1)(c). (people v. williams, supra, 227 cal.app.4th at p. 745.) thus, as appellant argues, and as the people concede, we must reverse the 10-year gang enhancement and instead impose the minimum parole eligibility of 15 years. 3 appellant raises an ineffective assistance of counsel argument if we conclude his trial attorney waived any objection to the voluntariness of the confession. the people concede nothing was waived. we have addressed the merits and need not reach the ineffective assistance of counsel argument. 21 disposition the judgment is modified to omit the 10-year gang enhancement and to impose the 15-year minimum parole eligibility provided by section 186.22, subdivision (b)(5). in all other respects, the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. _____________________, acting p. j. ashmann-gerst we concur: _____________________, j. hoffstadt _____________________, j.* goodman * retired judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
