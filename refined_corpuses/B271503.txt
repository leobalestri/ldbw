(a); count 1) and one count of slavery ( 181; count 2). defendant pled not guilty. on the third day of jury trial, however, defendant withdrew her not guilty plea and entered an open plea of no contest under section 1203.03 with a five-year maximum sentence. upon completion of the section 1203.03 diagnostic process and after a hearing, the trial court sentenced defendant to five years in state prison. the court selected count 1 ( 236.1, subd. (a)) as the base term and sentenced defendant to the low term of five years. the court imposed the middle term of three years for count 2 ( 181), to run concurrently. the parties submitted detailed briefs on the question of victim restitution. following a contested hearing, the court awarded dayana $93,209.56, which it calculated as follows: 1 all undesignated statutory references are to the penal code. 4 regular wages 3,278 hours @ $8/hour $26,224 ot wages 772 hours @ $12/hour $9,264 meal & rest breaks 964 violations @ $8 each $7,712 (wages paid) (96 pay periods @ $10 each) (-$960) interest on net wages & breaks 10% annual pre-judgment interest $12,828.12 total $55,068.12 liquidated damages 4,050 hours2 @ $8/hour $960 wages paid $31,440 interest on liquidated damages 10% annual pre-judgment interest $6,701.44 total $38,141.44 defendant filed a timely notice of appeal. ( 1237, subd. (b); people v. ford (2015) 61 cal.4th 282, 286 [victim restitution order is a post-rights].) discussion defendant convicted of human trafficking is entitled to criminal california law ( 1202.4, subd. (q).) labor code section 2 since liquidated damages do not apply to overtime or break violations (lab. code,  1194.2, subd. were deemed regular working hours for this purpose. (3,278 regular hours + 772 overtime hours = 4,050 liquidated damages hours.) 5 1194.2 (hereafter section 1194.2) provides that in certain civil actions for unpaid minimum wages, an employee is entitled to recover not only the unpaid wages, but also an equal amount of liquidated damages, plus interest. (lab. code,  1194.2, subd. (a).) the court below under the restitution statute included the liquidated damages available to civil plaintiffs under section 1194.2. defendant contends that section 1194.2 damages are a penalty that does not compensate dayana for her economic losses. as penalties are not a proper subject of criminal restitution, she argues, the liquidated damages portion of the restitution order was unauthorized. (see people v. harvest (2000) 84 cal.app.4th 641, 648 [victim restitution is not punishment compensation to an individual injured by crime the people contend the award was proper. in support of that view, they point us to the federal anti-trafficking statute, which contains restitution language similar to that used in california (18 u.s.c.  1593), and to the liquidated damages provision of the fair labor standards act (29 u.s.c.  216). the people urge us to federal statutes as well as conclusion that liquidated damages are compensatory, and as such, may be imposed here. we hold that because section 1194.2 unambiguously limits liquidated damages to certain enumerated civil actions, those damages cannot be applied in a criminal case. 1. standard of review sis an (people v. prunty (2015) 62 cal.4th 59, 71.) as with any case 6 involving statutory interpretation, our primary goal is to (people v. park (2013) 56 cal.4th 782, 796.) to determine intent, we first examine the statutory language and give the words their ordinary meaning.

[citations.] there is no requirement the (walker v. appellate division (2017) 14 cal.app.5th 651, 656657 (walker).) indeeddoes not preclude the crime victim from pursuing a separate civil action based on the same facts from which the criminal conviction (people v. vasquez (2010) 190 cal.app.4th 1126, 1132.) and california provides trafficking victims with a robust civil remedy. (civ. code,  52.5, subds. (a) [trafficking victim may recover fees, costs], (b) [treble damages for unpaid labor].) the people concede this basic point, but contend that the liquidated damages provided under that statute california law ( 1202.4, subd. (q)). certainly, section 1194.2 is a california lawbut subdivision (q) plainly does not encompass all california law. we therefore turn to the language of section 1194.2. 10 3. liquidated damages are not part of the value of the in any action under [labor code] section 98, 1193.6, 1194, or 1197.1 to recover wages because of the payment of a wage less than the minimum wage , an employee shall be entitled to recover liquidated damages in an amount equal to the wages unlawfully unpaid and interest thereon. nothing in this subdivision shall be construed to authorize the recovery of liquidated damages for failure to pay overtime compensation. subdivision (c) provides that the statute section 1194.2 is clear and unambiguous. by its terms, it (c)) under labor code unpaid minimum wages (subd. (a)). the statute is not self-executing. cannot recover liquidated damages under section 1194.2 unless (martinez, supra, 49 cal.4th at p. 49, fn. 11.) that is, the existence of a civil action is a condition precedent to section 1194.2 remedies. (see people v. durbin (1966) 64 cal.2d 474, 479 the recent opinion in walker is instructive. in that case, our colleagues in division five addressed the relationship between section 1202.4, the criminal restitution statute; business and professions code section 7028, which provides that victims of unlicensed contractors are eligible to receive criminal restitution; and business and professions code section 7031, which allows civil recovery of all compensation paid to an unlicensed 11 contractor. (walker, supra, 14 cal.app.5th 651.) the walker court held that section 1202.4 did not require the unlicensed-contractor defendant to disgorge all payments as criminal restitution: compensating the victim (id. at pp. 656658.) the court the statutory scheme, the civil remedy of refunding all compensation paid is intended to deter unlicensed contractors by depriving them of all monetary benefit [citation]. the restitution statute, in contrast, serves primarily to compensate victims for actual economic losses. unlike [business and professions code] section 7031, section 1202.4 does not provide for a full refund of all payments to an unlicensed contractor. a victim who is made whole for economic losses under section 1202.4 remains able to pursue the civil law remedy of a full refund. (id. at p. 658.) the people nevertheless argue that because the legislature did not explicitly exclude liquidated damages from the restitution provision, they may be awarded here. as there is no california authority interpreting section 1202.4, subdivision (q), the people urge us to follow united states v. sabhnani, a second circuit case in which the court held the victim of a federal trafficking offense was entitled to liquidated damages under the fair labor standards act (flsa).4 (united states v. sabhnani (2d cir. 2010) 599 f.3d 215, 259260 (sabhnani) the value of the victims labor as guaranteed under the minimum wage and overtime guarantees [of flsa], includes the liquidated 4 we note that in the seven years since it was decided, sabhnani has never been citedin any jurisdictionin an opinion in a criminal case. 12 damages mandated by [18 u.s.c.]  216. liquidated damages, the court concluded, rather compensation to the employee occasioned by the delay in flsa. [citation.] (id. at p. 260; cf. martinez, supra, 49 cal.4th at p. 48, fn. are in effect a penalty equal to the amount of unpaid minimum the people urge that the california anti-trafficking statute was based on its federal counterpart, and as such, we should treat our state liquidated damages provision like the federal liquidated damages provision. however, federal wage and overtime statutes differ in important ways from the laws of this state. (martinez, supra, 49 cal.4th at p. language or intent of state and federal labor laws substantially differ, reliance on federal regulations or interpretations to construe state regul]. first, as the people properly concede, liquidated damages are compensatory under federal law only because the flsa provides those damages in lieu of interest. indeed, the supreme court has long warned federal courts that to allow an employee to recover the basic statutory wage and liquidated damages, with interest, would have the effect of giving an employee double compensation for damages arising from delay in the payment of the basic minimum wages. (brooklyn sav. bank v. oneil (1945) 324 u.s. 697, 715716.) awarding both types of compensation, the court concluded, would produce the undesirable result of allowing interest on interest. 13 (ibid.) thus, liquidated damages were compensatory in sabhnani because without them, the victim would not have received any compensation for the wage delay. in this case, on the other hand, dayana received $12,828.12 in interest on the unpaid wages and $31,440 in liquidated damages and $6,701.44 in interest on the liquidated damages. second, sabhnani emphasized that the federal provision is self-executing, which makes the provision look more like compensation and less like a penalty. (sabhnani, supra, 599 f.3d at p. automatically by a violation of [minimum wage laws], so that an shall be liable to the employee or employees affected in the amount of their unpaid minimum wages, or their unpaid overtime compensation the distinction is important, a point the california supreme court stressed in support of its conclusion in murphy that wage and break premiums were wages rather than penalties. in that case, the court noted that an employee is entitled to break premiums miss a immediate entitlement to payment for wages or for overtime. [citation.] by contrast, labor code provisions imposing penalties or labor commissioner must first take some action to enforce them. the right to a penalty, unlike [pay for missed breaks] does not vest until someone has taken action to enforce it. (murphy, supra, 40 cal.4th at p. 1108.) unlike the break premiums at issue in murphy, section 1194.2 only applies if the plaintiff or the labor commissioner 14 brings a civil action. (lab. code,  1194.2, subd. action under section 98, 1193.6, 1194, or 1197.1 to recover wages because of the payment of wage less than the minimum wage an employee shall be entitled to recover (emphasis added)]; martinez, supra, 49 cal.4th at p. 49, fn. 11 ed provision]; accord walker, supra, 14 cal.app.5th at p. 657 [disgorgement of payments to unlicensed contractors requires civil action].) for these reasons, the court erred in awarding dayana liquidated damages as victim restitution. 15 disposition the restitution order is modified as follows. the portion of the restitution award attributable to liquidated damages ($31,440) and interest thereon ($6,701.44) is stricken. defendant is ordered to pay $55,068.12 in victim restitution, consisting of $34,528 in net wages, $7,712 in meal and rest break premiums, and $12,828.12 in interest. as modified, the order is affirmed. upon issuance of our remittitur, the trial court is directed to prepare corrected minute orders consistent with the views expressed in this opinion, amend the abstract of judgment and the victim restitution order to reflect the judgment as modified, and send a certified copy of the amended abstract of judgment to the department of corrections and rehabilitation. not to be published in the official reports lavin, j. we concur: edmon, p. j. dhanidina, j.* * judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
