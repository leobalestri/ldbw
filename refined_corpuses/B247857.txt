[] (1) the defendant has the right to a hearing before a judge to dispute the determination of the amount of restitution. the court may modify the amount, on its own motion or on the motion of the district attorney, the victim or victims, or the defendant. 4 if a motion is made for modification of a restitution order, the victim shall be notified of that motion at least 10 days prior to the proceeding held to decide the motion. [] . . . [] (3) to the extent possible, the restitution order shall be prepared by the sentencing court, shall identify each victim and each loss to which it pertains, and shall be of a dollar amount that is sufficient to fully reimburse the victim or victims for every determined not limited to, all of the following: [] . . .

[] (4)(a) if, as a result of restitution fund has provided assistance to or on behalf of a victim or derivative victim . . . the amount of assistance provided shall be presumed to be the restitu restitution unless it finds compelling and extraordinary reasons for not doing so and states those reasons on the record. . . . [] . . . [] (k) for shall include all of the following: [] . . . [] (3) a person who has sustained economic loss as the result of a crime and who satisfies any of the following conditions: [] (a) at the time of the crime was the p losses of a victim cannot be ascertained at the time of sentencing pursuant to subdivision (f) of section 1202.4, the court shall retain jurisdiction over a person subject to a restitution order for purposes of imposing or modifying restitution until such time as the losses may be determined. nothing in this section shall be construed as prohibiting a victim, the district attorney, or a court on its own motion from requesting correction, at any time, of a sentence when the sentence is invalid due to the omission of a restitution order or fine without a finding of compelling and extraordinary reasons pursuant to section 1202.4. 5 c. proceedings below restitution fine pursuant to section 1204.4, subdivision (b) in the amount of $200.00. a parole restitution fine in the same amount was imposed under section 1202.45, subdivision (a). prior to taking the plea, the court stated it was willing to approve the plea with the understanding that defendant was willing to give up his constitutional rights and that he understood all of the consequences associated with the plea. these were all explained on the plea form. defendant confirmed that his initials conveyed that he had reviewed the contents of the plea form and fully understood the consequences of his plea. no mention of victim restitution was mentioned by the court, the prosecutor, or the defense. will order me to pay between $200 and $10,000 to the victim restitution fund, and if d. analysis a sentence that omits a restitution order is invalid. (see people v. brown (2007) 147 cal.app.4th 1213, 1225-1226 (brown).) in people v. moreno (2003) 108 cal.app.4th 1, 10 (moreno), the court held that, when a sentence is invalid due to the lack of a restitution order or a finding that there were compelling and extraordinary the issue in moreno was whether the trial court may order a defendant to judgment was entered and affirmed on appeal. (moreno, supra, 108 cal.app.4th at p. 3.) the original sentence ibid.) the court concluded that the court may order such restitution based on section 1202.46. (moreno, at p. 3.) like defendant here, moreno was serving his prison sentence when the state first requested reimbursement. (ibidmention victim restitution at sentencing despite the requirement to make provision for 6 such restitution. (id. at p. 4.) the court did not retain jurisdiction to make a restitution order in the future, nor did it find there were compelling reasons for not ordering full restitution. (ibid.) we agree with moreno. under section 1202.46, the people may request correction of the sentence to include a restitution award at any time if the sentence is invalid due to the omission of a restitution order without a finding of compelling and extraordinary reasons. (moreno, supra, 108 cal.app.4th at p. 10; brown, supra, 147 cal.app.4th at p. 1225, fn. 7.) the victim may also request restitution, or the trial court can act on its own moreno, at p. 10.) the holding of people v. tillman (2000) 22 cal.4th 300, on which defendant relies, is inapposite. tillman determined that the people forfeited the right to seek the imposition of a restitution fine, which is paid into a state fund, by failing to timely raise the issue in the trial court. (see id. at p. 303.) this holding is not dispositive when the mandatory restitution award to the victim renders the original sentence invalid. likewise, we do not read tillman as the victim restitution issue at the sentencing defendant contends the sentencing court lost jurisdiction when defendant began serving his prison sentence. he asserts that none of the exceptions applied to his case. defendant cites the following exceptions to the rule that the trial court loses jurisdiction when a defendant begins serving a prison sentence: (1) the trial court may recall the sentence on its own motion within 120 days; (2) a trial court may correct a clerical error, but not a judicial error, at any time; and (3) an unauthorized sentence may be corrected at any time. 7 b. analysis once again, moreno is dispositive. the moreno court held that, notwithstanding [italics added] to impose or modify a restitution order, the second part of section 1202.46 permits the prosecutor, at any time, to request correction of a sentence that is invalid because . . . the court at the initial moreno, supra, 108 cal.app.4th at p. 10.) the court also concluded that section 1202.46 was not limited to circumstances in which the loss could not be ascertained at sentencing. (moreno, at p. 10.) it pointed out that there is no provision of section 1202.46 contained language indicating it is not limited by the first sentence. (moreno, at p. 10.) ry restitution resulted in an invalid sentence. the language indicating that the trial court to formally retain jurisdiction on the record. accordingly, section 1202.46 authorizes the delayed entry of a victim restitution order in defenda iii. estoppel defendant argues that it was a violation of due process to permit the people to correct their error after several years of delay. defendant asserts that he justly feels unfairly treated and frustrated in his desire to move on. as a party to the agreement in this case, the people must be equitably estopped from obtaining the late restitution order. b. relevant authority ne when [he or she has] notice of the amount of the restitution claimed . . . , and . . . has an 8 opportunity to challenge the figures . . . at the sentencing hearipeople v. prosser (2007) 157 cal.app.4th 682, 692; see also people v. thygesen (1999) 69 cal.app.4th 988, 993; people v. cain (2000) 82 cal.app.4th 81, 86.) [citation], but only people v. castillo (2010) 49 cal.4th 145, 156, fn. 12.) must be present . . . : (1) the party to be estopped must be apprised of the facts; (2) he must intend that his conduct shall be acted upon, or must so act that the party asserting the estoppel had a right to believe it was so intended; (3) the other party must be ignorant of the true state of facts; and (4) he robinson v. fair employment & housing com. (1992) 2 cal.4th 226, 244-founded on concepts of equity and fair dealing. it provides that a person may not deny the existence of a state of facts if he intentionally led another to believe a particular people v. castillo, supra, 49 cal.4th at p. 155, fn. 10.) right require it, the doctrine is inapplicable if it would result in the nullification of a strong rule of policy adopted for the benefit of the strong v. county of santa cruz (1975) 15 cal.3d 720, 725, citing city of long beach v. mansell (1970) 3 cal.3d 462, 493.) c. analysis restitution award are satisfied if he is given notice of the amount of restitution sought and a hearing at which he has an opportunity to challenge the request. (people v. thygesen, supra, 69 cal.app.4th 988, 993.) here, defendant received notice of the amount sought and had the opportunity to be heard on the issue at the february 28, 2013 hearing, and he did not claim otherwise in those proceedings. 9 we need not discuss whether the elements of an estoppel are established in this case, since the doctrine cannot be applied against a governmental entity when to do so would defeat the effective operation of a policy adopted by the legislature to protect the public. (strong v. county of santa cruz, supra, 15 cal.3d at p. 725; city of long beach v. mansell, supraornia has adopted a comprehensive constitutional and legislative scheme for providing restitution for crime victims. article people of the state of california that all persons who suffer losses as a result of criminal activity shall have the right to restitution from the persons convicted of the crimes for (a)(1).) in addition to direct restitution payments to the victim from the offender, the legislature has over time, beginning first in 1965, developed a statutory scheme providing for indemnity for crime victims by the state board of control. [citations.] the statutory scheme providing for the operation of the restitution fund is extensive and wide-people v. hong (1998) 64 cal.app.4th 1071, 1078.) restitution order. there is unsubd. (b)[(13)(a)]people v. fulton examining the restitution every victim who suffers a loss shall have the right to restitution from those convicted of the crime giving people v. keichler (2005) 129 cal.app.4th 1039, 1046.) the legislative intent is to ensure that victims are made whole. (people v. bernal (2002) 101 cal.app.4th 155, 168.) estoppel argument against the people is without merit, and he suffered no violation of due process. 10 iv. restitution and plea agreement plea agreement, it constitutes a violation of that agreement, and he is entitled to performance of his bargain. he argues that the only effective remedy would be to strike the restitution order as not having been a term of the bargain. b. relevant authority due process requires that, when a guilty plea is entered in exchange for an agreed punishment, both parties must abide by the terms of the agreement and [t]he punishment may not significantly exceed that which the parties agreed upon. (people v. walker (1991) 54 cal.3d 1013, 1024 (walker), disapproved on another point in people v. villalobos (2012) 54 cal.4th 177, 183.) c. analysis the fact that the prosecutor did not mention a possible restitution award at the plea-bargaining or sentencing stages did not result in forfeiture of victim restitution in this cictim restitution may not be bargained away by the people. the legislature left no discretion or authority with the trial court or the prosecution to bargain away the victims constitutional and statutory right to restitution. as such, it cannot properly be the subject of plea negotiations. (brown, supra, 147 cal.app.4th at p. 1226.) brown distinguished walkerdiscretion available to the court in setting the restitution fine and its lack of discretion in setting victim restitution explains why the amount of the restitution fine (between the statutory minimum and maximum) is an appropriate issue for plea negotiations but the amount of victim restitution is not. (compare walker, supra, 54 cal.3d at p. 1030 people v. valdez [1994] 24 cal.app.4th [1194] at p. 1203 [victim [] the court in walker was able to effect substantial specific performance of the plea bargain because such an outcomereducing the restitution fine to the statutory minimumwas within 11 discretion here to award less than full victim restitution without a statement of extraordinary and compelling reasons for the limitation. therefore, specific performance brown, supra, 147 cal.app.4th at p. 1228.) because it violated his plea agreement must be rejected. disposition the order appealed from is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. boren, p.j. we concur: chavez, j. ferns, j.* _______________________________________________________________ * judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
