(a)-(d), 667, subd. (b), 667.5). west was also charged with misdemeanor sexual battery ( 243.4, subd. (e)(1), count 7). the trial and testified in his own defense. the jury convicted defendants of all counts, and the trial aggregate term of 30 years to life in prison, consisting of 25 years to life under the three strikes law on count 1, and a five-year serious felony enhancement. he received the same sentence for the other counts, to run concurrently with count 1. west was sentenced to an aggregate prison term of eight years and six months, consisting of the midterm of three years on count 1, with consecutive one-year terms for counts 2 through 6 (consisting of one-third the midterm of three years), with a consecutive six-month sentence on the sexual battery count. on appeal, smith contends the trial court failed to instruct the jury, sua sponte, to testimony with caution; abused its discretion when it denied his motion to romero2 when it refused to strike one of his prior strike convictions. defendant west contends the instruction on or analysis. finding no merit in any of the above contentions, we affirm. facts on january 1, 2011, at 2:30 a.m., irving romero, spencer mcgee, beatriz dealba, k.m., and mynor palencia were on 39th place in los angeles, walking to 1 all undesignated statutory references are to the penal code. 2 people v. superior court (romero) (1996) 13 cal.4th 497 (romero). 3 smith and west walked up to them, and smith told the group they were being robbed. smith told the partygoers to give him everything in their pockets or he would shoot them. he did not brandish a gun, but kept one hand in his pocket, positioned as if he held a gun. romero gave his cell phone and a whistle to smith. he saw west take items from the other victims. palencia gave $9 and two subway receipts to smith. palencia gave k.m.which he was holding for her, to west. he saw one of the defendants take the money and the other take the phones. mcgee gave smith $58, his cell phone, and a salvadoran coin. west took items from other group members as smith was yelling that they were being robbed. also, smith handed property he had taken to west. k.m. told defendants that she did not have anything, because her pants did not have pockets. smith told her to give him her earrings. she gave one of her earrings to smith. west walked toward her, and she tried to give him her other earring. west tapped something in her ear. west dropped k.m. dealba gave her cell phone to smith. smith allowed the group to leave, one by one. romero walwhere he had parked his car before the party, and called police. he saw defendants jump over a nearby fence. police arrived 15 minutes later. defendants approached another group of partiers on 39th place at approximately 2:30 a.m. smith told them to give him their wallets and jewelry and said he had a gun. jairo ayon handed his wallet to west. west checked the wallet and returned it to ayon because it held no money. ayon handed his watch to smith. defendants started to walk away, but turned around and ran towards ayon and his group. defendants crossed the street to a gate that led to an apartment building and banged and screamed at the gate. 4 los angeles police officers matthew casalicchio and danny monterroso were patrolling near 39th place when they were flagged down by a third group, who told them defendants had tried to rob them. they described defendants and pointed to where they were last seen. the officers saw defendants standing next to a gate on 39th place. the them. whistle, k.m.cell phones belonging to mcgee, k.m., and romero, and an additional white cell phone. the items were returned to their owners. that she had a party at her apartment from 6:30 p.m. to 2:30 a.m. on the night of the robberies. smith was there most of the night and appeared to be drunk. as the party was coming to an end, brown went outside and saw smith in a police car. west also attended the party. brown told a defense investigator that west was her cousin, but admitted at trial that she was not related to west. before. the white cell phone police recovered belonged to him. he denied possessing the other cell phones, and believed he was wrongfully identified. defendants were found guilty on all counts. during sentencing, the trial court romero motion to dismiss one of his prior strike convictions for sentencing purposes. defendants filed timely appeals. discussion 1. accomplice testimony smith contends the trial court should have instructed the jury, sua sponte, to view 334 and caljic no. 3.18. a trial court should give calcrim no. 334 or caljic no. 3.18 when an accomplice 5 testifies, and that testimony tends to incriminate the defendant. (people v. howard (2008) 42 cal.4th 1000, 1021-1022; people v. guiuan (1998) 18 cal.4th 558, 569.) the and testimony may inunder oath in a court proceeding and all out-of-court statements of accomplices and coconspirators used as substantive evidence of guilt which are made under suspect people v. williams (1997) 16 cal.4th 153, 245; see also people v. lawley (2002) 27 cal.4th 102, 160.) from this testimony that smith served time in custody, but this testimony did not incriminate smith in the commission of the charged crimes. (people v. howard, supra, 42 cal.4th at pp. 1021-1022.) -examination of -examination ta-examining -examining officer monterroso, west repeatedly asked whether the victims told him that there was only one person who robbed them. however, the questions asked of witnesses by counsel or self-represented parties are not testimonial, and therefore are not accomplice testimony. (see people v. samayoa (1997) 15 cal.4th 795, 844; people v. barajas (1983) 145 cal.app.3d 804, 809.) the the attorneys say is evidence. . . answers 6 the jury was insevidence, and because no accomplice testified in a way that tended to incriminate smith, we conclude the trial court had no obligation to give an accomplice testimony instruction. (see people v. samayoa, at p. 844; see also rufo v. simpson (2001) 86 cal.app.4th 573, 598-599 [the jury is presumed to have followed instructions].) any claim of error in failing to give the accomplice instruction was necessarily harmless. witnesses that smith robbed the victims. the police recovered property taken from all of the victims from smith, and the victims identified smith at trial as one of the people that robbed them. quite simply, there is no reasonable possibility that if the trial court had given these instructions, the jury would have reached a different verdict. (people v. lewis (2001) 26 cal.4th 334, 370, 371.) 2. severance next, smith contends he was denied a fair trial because the court denied his people v. lewis (2008) 43 cal.4th 415, 452; people v. boyde (1988) 46 offense, whether felony or misdemeanor, they must be tried jointly, unless the court 1098.) joint trials are preferred because they promote economy and efficiency and because they serve the interests of justice by avoiding possibly inconsistent verdicts. (people v. coffman (2004) 34 cal.4th 1, 40.) a joint trial is proper where multiple defendants are charged with common crimes involving common events and victims. (people v. lewis, supra, at pp. 452-453.) on the other hand, the trial the face of an incriminating confession, prejudicial association with codefendants, likely confusion resulting from evidence on multiple counts, conflicting defenses, or the 7 (people v. massie (1967) 66 cal.2d 899, 917, fns. omitted; people v. coffman, supra, at p. 40.) based on the facts as they appeared when the court ruled on the motion. (people v. hardy required only if it is reasonably probable that the defendant would have obtained a more people v. lewis, supra, 43 cal.4th at p. 452; see also people v. coffman, supra, proper when it was made, we may reverse a judgment only on a showing that the joinder people v. mendoza (2000) 24 cal.4th 130, 162.) -examination of witnesses was antagonistic; west disagree. as discussed above, west did nothing to incriminate smith. although he attempted to elicit testimony that smith may have acted alone, the witnesses all testified that both smith and west acted together. therefore, we cannot conclude that west defendants been tried separately. (people v. souza (2012) 54 cal.4th 90, 112.) in issues raised in co-to no facts or law whidiscretion or grossly unfair (people v. stanley (1995) 10 cal.4th 764, 793), and for the reasons discussed above as to smith, we can find no error. 3. romero smith also complains that the trial court abused its discretion when it denied his motion to dismiss one of his prior strike convictions. he contends he does not fall within 8 the spirit of the three strikes law, because his strikes were remote, as they both arose from a 1999 case; and because he did not hurt his victims in the current offenses, was intoxicated, and did not actually possess a gun. we disagree, and find no abuse of discretion. trial courts have discretion under section 1385 to dismiss three strikes allegations in the furtheabuse of discretion standard of review. (romero, supra, 13 cal.4th at pp. 529-530; people v. carrasco (2008) 163 cal.app.4th 978, 992-993.) the burden is on the party attacking the sentence to show the sentencing decision was an abuse of discretion. in the absence of such a showing, the trial court is presumed to have acted appropriately, and a sentence will not be set aside. (people v. carmony (2004) 33 cal.4th 367, 376-377.) an abuse of discretion occurs only when the trial court was not aware of its discretion to dismiss, where the court considered impermissible factors, or where the defendant clearly falls outside the spirit of the three strikes law. (people v. scott (2009) 179 cal.app.4th 920, 926.) the analysis is whether, in light of the nature and circumstances of the present prospects, he may be deemed outside the spirit of the three strikes law and should therefore be treated as if he had not previously been convicted of the qualifying felony. (carrasco, at p. 993.) car keys. at the time of the crimes, smith was nearly 19 years old. smith was sentenced to 12 years in prison. at the time of the instant offenses, he was on parole, and had only recently been released from prison. in his romero motion, smith asked the court to dismiss one of his strike offenses, . . . [t]here was no gun ever found was quite young when he was sente 9 engaged in . . . [the] late 1990 the trial court understood the scope of its discretion and decided not to dismiss previous incarceration, as he re-offended soon after being released from prison while he was still on parole. the trial court did not err in finding defendant is within the spirit of the three strikes law. (see people v. williams (1998) 17 cal.4th 148, 163.) 4. place of temporary safety west contends the trial court erred by instructing the jury with the standard calcrim no. 1603 aiding and abetting robbery instruction. although the instruction properly emphasized safety may be fleeting or momentary. west contends that, somehow, this failure prevented the jury from finding that he only received stolen property after the robberies did not intend to aid and abet the robbery of the first group of partygoers because he was focused on his sexual battery upon k.m. while smith was taking and carrying away their property. west argues the jury may have found he was unaware that robberies had respondent argues that this issue was forfeited, because west did not object to the written instruction at trial. west replies that because his substantial rights are affected, this court may review the error without an objection. west also contends that because the challenged instruction was not correct in law, he did not have to object at trial. (see people v. ramos (2008) 163 cal.app.4th 1082, 1087.) we are not persuaded either that law. 10 in considering a claim of instructional error we must first ascertain what the relevant law provides, and then determine what meaning the instruction given conveys. the test is whether there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury understood the instruction in a we consider the specific language under challenge and, if necessary, the instructions as a people v. andrade (2000) 85 cal.app.4th 579, 585; people v. castillo (1997) 16 centire charge of the court, not from a consideration of parts of an instruction or from a in the possession of another, from his person or immediate presence, and against his will, accomplished by means of a robbery continues people v. cooper (1991) 53 cal.3d 1158, 1165 & fn. 8 (cooper).) aider and abettor liability attaches if the intent to aid in the robbery is formed before or during the carrying away of the property to a place of temporary safety. (id. at pp. 1164-1165.) a place of temporary safety may be reached momentarily; the defendant need not permanently escape with the loot. (see people v. boss (1930) 210 cal. 245, 250-251.) however, a defendant has not reached a place of temporary safety with the loot if he is present at the scene of the crime, or while fleeing from the scene of the crime. (people v. haynes (1998) 61 cal.app.4th 1282, 1296-1297; people v. salas (1972) 7 cal.3d 812, 821-823.) here, the trial court instructed the jury with the standard calcrim no. 1603 instruction: formed the intent to aid and abet the commission of the robbery before or while a perpetrator carried away the property to a place of temporary safety. [] a perpetrator has reached a place of temporary safety with the property if he or she has successfully escaped from the scene, is no longer being pursued, and has unchallenged possession of that defendant chakel west is guilty of a crime based on aiding and abetting that crime, 11 the people must prove that: [] 1. the perpetrator committed the crime; [] 2. the defendant knew that the perpetrator intended to commit the crime; [] 3. before or during the commission of the crime, the defendant intended to aid and abet the aids and abets intends to, and does in fact, aid, facilitate, promote, encourage, or instigate the calcrim no. 1603 is a correct statement of the law. the instruction provides the intent to aid and abet a robbery must be formed before the perpetrator has carried the property away to a place of temporary safety. (cooper, supra, 53 cal.3d at p. 1165.) the instruction specifically states tadditional words in the instruction to the effect that temporary safety may be only momentary. we find no merit to on the elements of robbery on an aiding and abetting theory. 5. abstracts of judgment additional fines and fees. during its oral pronouncement of judgment, the trial court imposed a $10 crime prevention fine ( 1202.5) for each of the seven counts of which west was convicted. the abstract of judgment, however, only imposed one crime prevention fine. we find no error in the abstract of judgment, because the court may only impose one crime prevention fine case in which a defendant is convicted of any . . 1202.5, subd. (a), italics added; people v. crittle (2007) 154 calthe crime prevention fine can be imposed only 12 includes six crime prevention fines, should be amended to only include one. respondent also contends that other required penalties were not assessed against defendants smith and west. because both defendants were assessed crime prevention fines under section 1202.5, subdivision (a), the court was required to assess other penalties. (see  1202.5, subd. (a) [$10 fine]; 1464, subd. (a)(1) [$10 state penalty]; 1465.7, subd. (a) [$2 surcharge]; gov. code,  76000, subd. (a)(1) [$7 county penalty]; 70372, subd. (a)(1) [$5 court construction penalty]; 76000.5, subd. (a)(1) [$2 penalty]; 76104.7, subd. (a), stats. 2009-2010, ch. 3,  1 [$3 penalty];  76104.6, subd. (a)(1) [$1 additional penalties. disposition the judgment is affirmed as modified. the abstracts of judgment for smith and also amended to include only one $10 fine under section 1202.5, subdivision (a). the superior court is directed to prepare amended abstracts of judgment and shall forward certified copies of the same to the department of corrections. not to be published in the official reports grimes, j. we concur: bigelow, p. j. rubin, j.
