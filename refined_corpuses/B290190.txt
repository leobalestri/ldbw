(a)(2)). grijalva did not pursue an appeal. representing himself, grijalva on april 13, 2018 filed a petition for consideration of resentencing, requesting the superior court to exercise its newly created discretion under senate bill no. 620 to strike or dismiss the section 12022.53, subdivision (c), firearm-use enhancements. the superior court denied the petition on april 24, 2018, ruling that senate bill no. 620 did not on may 21, 2018 grijalva filed a notice of appeal in which he marked the preprinted box othernd stated he was appealing the denial of his petition for resentencing. concurrently with his notice of appeal grijalva filed a request for certification of probable cause. the superior court did not rule on that request. 3 discussion we appointed counsel to represent grijalva on appeal. after examination of the record, counsel filed an opening brief in which no issues were raised. on july 18, 2018 we advised grijalva that he had 30 days within which to submit any contentions or issues he wished us to consider. we have received no response. we have examined the record and are satisfied grijalvaappellate attorney has fully complied with her responsibilities as counsel and no arguable issue exits. (see smith v. robbins (2000) 528 u.s. 259, 277-284 [120 s.ct. 746, 145 l.ed.2d 756]; people v. kelly (2006) 40 cal.4th 106, 118-119; people v. wende (1979) 25 cal.3d 436, 441-442.) utory motion for resentencing section 12022.53, subdivision (h), were properly before the trial court, a somewhat doubtful proposition, his claim lacks merit. a criminal defendant who appeals following a plea of no contest or guilty without a certificate of probable cause can only challenge the denial of a motion to suppress evidence or raise grounds arising after the entry of the plea that do not affect the plea's validity. (cal. rules of court, rule 8.304(b)(4); see people v. johnson (2009) 47 cal.4th 668, 678.) grijalva is, in effect, challenging the validity of his plea without a certificate of probable cause by seeking modification of the sentence imposed as part of his plea agreement. in any event, as the superior court ruled, the judgment in this case was final prior to january 1, 2018. senate bill no. 620amendment to penal code section 12022.53, subdivision (h), applies retroactively only to cases not yet final on appeal on its 4 effective date. (people v. harris (2018) 22 cal.app.5th 657, 659; see people v. hurlic (2018) 25 cal.app.5th 50, 56.) does not qualify for relief. disposition the order is affirmed. perluss, p. j. we concur: zelon, j. feuer, j.
