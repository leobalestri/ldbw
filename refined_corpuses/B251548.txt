(nov. 6, 2012), effective nov. 7, 2012). in his petition, billings represented that he is serving a third-strike sentence for a 1999 conviction for second degree robbery under section 211. on july 26, 2013, the trial court denied the petition with prejudice because billingss third-strike offense of second degree robbery is a violent felony conviction, which renders him ineligible for resentencing under section 1170.126. billings filed a notice of appeal.2 we appointed counsel to represent billings in the matter. after examining the record, counsel filed a wende brief raising no issues on appeal and requesting that we independently review the record. (people v. wende (1979) 25 cal.3d 436.) on december 6, 2013, we directed appointed counsel to immediately send the record on this appeal and a copy of the opening brief to billings and notified billings that within 30 days from the date of the notice he could submit by letter or brief any ground of appeal, contention or argument he wished us to consider. we did not receive a response from him. we have examined the entire record and determined that, because billingss third-strike offense of second degree robbery is a violent felony ( 667.5, subd. (c)(9)), he cannot benefit from the provisions of section 1170.126. ( 1170.126, subds. (b) & (e)(1).) we are satisfied that billingss attorneys have fully complied with their responsibilities and that no arguable appellate issue exists.
