(a)2), for which he received a three strikes sentence of 25 years to life. in 2013, he filed a petition for recall of his three strikes sentence pursuant to section 1170.126. the trial court denied the petition on the ground that lerma had been armed with a firearm during the commission of his offense within the meaning of sections 667, subd. (e)(2)(c)(iii), and 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(c)(iii), which disqualified him from resentencing consideration. we will affirm this ruling. background people v. lerma (aug. 30, 2000, b134827) [nonpub. opn.]), we reported that the trial evidence established the following facts. on august 29, 1998, los angeles police officer fernando delatorre and his partner responded to the el chaparral restaurant in sylmar to investigate a report that someone had a gun. delatorre testified that when the officers arrived, delatorre searched the restaurant parking lot and noticed lerma making motions with his hands as 1 all further statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise stated. 2 the deadly weapons recodification act of 2010 repealed and recodified former sections 12000 to 12809 without substantive change. ( 16000, 16005, 16010.) former section 12021, subdivision (a), was recodified without substantive change at section 29800, subdivision (a) operative january 1, 2012. (cal. law revision com. com., 14 3 if he were chambering a round in a semiautomatic weapon.3 when delatorre drew his own gun and ordered lerma to show his hands, lerma scooted over toward a light pillar, put his hands behind the pillar where delatorre could not see them, and continued that motion of chambering a round. lerma then made a throwing motion toward his left. after lerma finally complied with orders to get on the ground, delatorre searched and next to it a small .22 caliber semiautomatic handgun. the gun had jammed because there was a bullet stuck in the firing mechanism. the proper way to clear such a jam was do on january 25, 2013, after proposition 36 was enacted, lerma sought resentencing. on march 7, 2013, the superior court (judge william c. ryan) issued an pril 23, 2015, discussion 1. the act. people v. johnson (2015) 61 cal.4th 674 (johnson), purpose and provisions as follows: defendant who had two or more prior convictions of violent or serious felonies receive a third strike sentence of a minimum of 25 years to life for any current felony conviction, even if the current offense was neither serious nor violent. (former  667, subds. (d), 3 [of the weapon] rearward which allows a cartridge to come up and be slid into position to fire. 4 (e)(2)(a), 1170.12, subds. (b), (c)(2)(a).)[4] the [prospective portions of the] act[5] amended the three strikes law with respect to defendants whose current conviction is for a felony that is neither serious nor violent. in that circumstance, unless an exception applies, the defendant is to receive a second strike sentence of twice the term otherwise provided for the current felony, pursuant to the provisions that apply when a defendant has one prior conviction for a serious or violent felony. ( 667, subd. (e)(2)(c), 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(c); see  667.5, subd. (c) [list of violent felonies], 1192.7 [list of serious felonies], 1192.8 [additional serious felonies for purposes of  1192.7].) current offense and prior offenses. if the current offense involves controlled substances and specified findings are made concerning the quantity of controlled substances involved, or if the current offense is among specified sex offenses, a defendant with two or more strikes must be sentenced to a term of at least 25 years to life. [fn. omitted.] ( 667, subd. (e)(2)(c)(i)-(ii), 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(c)(i)-(ii).) a third strike sentence is firearm, was armed with a firearm or deadly weapon, or intended to cause great bodily (e)(2)(c)(iii), 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(c)(iii).) finally, a defendant will be excluded from the new sentencing provisions if he or she suffered a prior conviction for . . . [certain offenses listed in  667, subd. (e)(2)(c)(iv) and  1170.12, subd. [citation, fn. omitted.] that are neither violent nor serious, the act provides a procedure by which some prisoners 4 667, subds. (b)-(i); stats. 1994, ch. 12,  1, p. 71), and thereafter by the voters by way of proposition 184 ( johnson, supra, 61 cal.4th at p. 681, fn. 1.) 5 the prospective provisions of the act ( 667, subd. (e)(2)(c), 1170.12, subd. effective date of the act. 5 already serving third strike sentences may seek resentencing in accordance with the new . . [t]he inmate is serving an indeterminate term of life imprisonment imposed pursuant to [the three strikes law] for a conviction of a felony or felonies that are not defined as serious 1170.126, subd. (e)(1).) like a defendant who is being sentenced under the new provisions, an inmate is disqualified from resentencing if any of the exceptions set forth in section 667, subdivision (e)(2)(c) and section 1170.12, subdivision (c)(2)(c) are present. ( 1170.126, subd. (e).) in contrast to the rules that apply to sentencing, however, the rules governing resentencing provide that an inmate resentencing the petitioner would pose an unreasonable risk ( 1170.126, subd. johnson, supra, 61 cal.4th at pp. 680-682.) 2. the trial court correctly ruled that lerma was ineligible for resentencing. during his violation of former section 12021 for possessing a firearm, he was also armed with a firearm. (see  667, subd. (e)(2)(c)(iii), 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(c)(iii).) (a)(1), . . . are that a person, who has previously been convicted of a felony, had in his or her possession crime of possession of a firearm by a felon may involve the act of personally carrying or being in actual physical possession of a firearm . . . such an act is not an essential element of a violation of former section 12021, subdivision (a), because a conviction of this arm. defendant knowingly exercised a right to control the prohibited item, either directly or a firearm that is, having ready access to a firearm [citation] necessarily requires possession of the firearm, possession of a firearm does not necessarily require that the possessor be people v. brimmer (2014) 230 cal.app.4th 782, 795.) 6 defendant utilize a firearm or even carry one on the body. a defendant is armed if the defendant has the specified weapon available for use, either offensively or defensively. the ready access of the weapon that constipeople v. bland (1995) 10 cal.4th 991, 997, italics omitted (bland).) every commitment offense for unlawful possession of a gun necessarily involves being armed with the gun, if the gun is not otherwise available for immediate use in connection with its possession, e.g., where it is people v. elder (2014) 227 cal.app.4th 1308, 1313-1314.) a firearm is found next to his bed. the parolee is in possession of the firearm, because it is under his dominion and control. if he is not home at the time, however, he is not armed with the firearm, because it is not readily available to him for offensive or defensive use. accordingly, possessing a firearm does not necessarily constitute being people v. osuna (2014) 225 cal.app.4th 1020, 1030, fn. omitted.) numerous cases have concluded that, under proposition 36, a conviction for being a felon in possession of a firearm disqualifies an inmate from resentencing if the nature of that possession amounted to arming as defined in bland. (see, e.g., people v. white (2014) 223 cal.app.4th 512, 525-526 [defendant who tossed away handgun while running from police found to be armed with a firearm and, thus, not eligible for resentencing]; people v. hicks (2014) 231 cal.app.4th 275, 280, 284 [where defendant was detained at front gate of apartment complex and a gun was found inside his backpack in apartment he had been visiting, defendant was held to be armed and, thus, not eligible for resentencing]; people v. brimmer, supra, 230 cal.app.4th at pp. 796-797 [defendant 7 who threatened his girlfriend with shotgun during argument was found to be armed and not entitled to resentencing]; people v. elder, supra, 227 cal.app.4th at p. 1317 [police found defendant outside his apartment and inside found a gun on cabinet shelf and a second gun in bedroom safe; defendant was found to be armed with a firearm and thus ineligible for resentencing].) hence, to be ineligible for resentencing, there need not be a facilitative nexus (or 6 armein imposed (italics added), the act disqualifies an inmate from eligibility for lesser d]uring internat. dict. (1993) p. 703.) thus, there must be a temporal nexus between the arming and the underlying felony, not a facilitative one 6 for enhancement nexus with the underlying offense (i.e., it serves (people v. brimmer, supra, 230 cal.app.4th at pp. 794-795.) this concept of bland, supra, 10 cal.4th at p. 1002: defendant to be subject to additional punishment for being armed with a firearm, of the underlying felony. ( 12022, subd. (a)(1).) with respect to felony drug possession defendant had the firearm available for use in furtherance of the drug offense at some thus, by specifying that the added during facilitative nexus evidence requirement: he gives rise to the inference that the 8 (people v. hicks, supra, 231 cal.app.4th at pp. 283-284, italics added; accord people v. brimmer, supra, 230 cal.app.4th at pp. 798-799; people v. osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1032.) 12021 chamber a round in a semi-automatic firearm; lerma made a throwing motion; from the area toward which lerma had made the throwing motion, delatorre and his partner discovered a semi-automatic handgun with bullets jammed in its mechanism; and lerma told delatorre that the object lerma was seen holding and then throwing was the subsequently recovered semi-automatic handgun and, therefore, that lerma had been in actual possession of the -in-possession conviction was based on the se, during the commission of that offense, [therefore] the armed-with-a-firearm exclusion applies and, people v. brimmer, supra, 230 cal.app.4th at p. 805, italic added.) because there was a temporal nexus between the arming and the underlying felony of being a felon in possession of a firearm, the trial court properly ruled that lerma was ineligible for resentencing under proposition 36. 9 disposition the post-judgment order denying lermresentencing is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports edmon, p. j. we concur: aldrich, j. hogue, j.* * judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
