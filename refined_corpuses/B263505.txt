(a)(4)). on september 24, 2012, he pleaded no contest to felony assault, and, on december 4, 2012, sentence was suspended and he was placed on three in lieu of additional jail time, he was ordered to complete 30 days of caltrans or community labor. dean violated probation and, at his june 12, 2014 probation violation hearing, the trial court gave him a choice: two years in prison or, if he waived back time (i.e., presentence custody credits), remain on probation and receive a four-year suspended sentence. after dean conferred with his counsel, dean elected to remain on probation. he was accordingly sentenced, on august 4, 2014, to the high term of four years for assault with a waiver of back time, which sentence was suspended. dean, in january 2015, was living in a permission, for which he was charged with trespass. at the probation violation hearing, a deputy testified that when he arrived, dean resisted arrest. while being transported to the police station, dean said he was having a seizure and panic attack. but medical personnel found nothing wrong with dean. ruben vargas, a psychiatric social worker, . vargas suggested a more thorough psychiatric evaluation and, possstemmed also from drug abuse. the trial court found that dean violated probation by failing to complete community labor and by trespassing. after finding dean ineligible for sentencing under proposition 47 and declining to place dean in a program to address his alleged mental 1 all further undesignated statutory references are to the penal code. 3 illness, the court, on march 6, 2015, sentenced him to four years in prison. he had 88 days of presentence custody credits (44 actual plus 44 good time/work time). discussion after review of the record, s court-appointed counsel filed an opening brief which raised no issues and asked this court to conduct an independent review of the record, under people v. wende (1979) 25 cal.3d 436, 441. by letter dated december 24, 2015, we advised dean that he had 30 days to submit by brief or letter any contentions or argument he wished this court to consider. dean submitted two letter briefs raising several contentions. the trial court, however, disagreed that dean has a mental illness and the second, dean contenhe understand the terms related to a suspended sentence, namely waiving presentence custody credits. to the extent dean intends by this to raise an ineffective assistance of the record claim, we reject it. (see generally strickland v. washington (1984) 466 u.s. 668, 684; people v. scott (1997) 15 cal.4th 1188, 1211-1212.) the trial court repeatedly told dean at the june 12, 2014 probation violation hearing that the only way it would reinstate probation was if dean waived back time. dean also conferred with his counsel before agreeing to have probation reinstated. finally, to the extent dean contends his felony assault conviction should have been reduced to misdemeanor battery under proposition 47, he did not fall within the ambit of that law. (see generally  1170.18.) to the extent dean asks this court to consider in the first instance a petition for redesignation of his assault to misdemeanor battery under proposition 47, such a petition must be filed in the trial court that entered the judgment of conviction. ( 1170.18, subd. (a).) we have examined the record and are satisfied deanappellate attorney has fully complied with the responsibilities of counsel and no arguable issue exists.
