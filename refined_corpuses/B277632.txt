filed 5/1/18 p. v. moallem ca2/3 not to be published in the official reports california rules of court, rule 8.1115(a), prohibits courts and parties from citing or relying on opinions not certified for publication or ordered published, except as specified by rule 8.1115(b). this opinion has not been certified for publication or ordered published for purposes of rule 8.1115. in the court of appeal of the state of california second appellate district division three the people, plaintiff and respondent, v. aharon eleazar moallem, defendant and appellant. b277632 (los angeles county super. ct. no. va140195) appeal from a judgment of the superior court of los angeles county, olivia rosales, judge. affirmed and remanded with directions. katharine eileen greenebaum, under appointment by the court of appeal, for defendant and appellant. xavier becerra, attorney general, gerald a. engler, chief assistant attorney general, lance e. winters, assistant attorney general, stephanie c. brenan and abtin amir, deputy attorneys general, for plaintiff and respondent. _________________________ 2 defendant aharon eleazar moallem appeals his sentence for criminal threats with the use of a knife and assault with a deadly weapon. moallem contends the trial court should have stayed his sentence on one of those two counts under penal code section 654. we agree. we therefore remand the case for the background the people charged moallem with criminal threats, assault with a deadly weapon (a knife), and vandalism. the people alleged moallem had used a deadly weapon (the knife) in the commission of the criminal threats within the meaning of penal code section 12022, subdivision (b)(1). as the evidence at trial is not at issue in this appeal, we summarize it briefly. on september 25, 2015, steve mullen was at the mullen and three of his employees were moving a metal canopy. moallem showed up at the restaurant and ate some food. moallem came outside and told his father he needed money. moallem said his father owed him money for a typewriter. moallem was very aggressive; he was yelling. mullen asked and a3 inch the case proceeded to trial in july 2016. on august 1, 2016, the jury acquitted moallem on the vandalism charge and found him guilty of the criminal threats and assault charges. the jury also found true the knife use allegation on the criminal threats count. at the sentencing hearing on august 23, 2016, the trial court imposed sentence but suspended execution of that sentence. on the criminal threats count, the court selected the knife. on the assault with a deadly weapon charge, the court sentenced moallem to the middle term of three years. the court placed moallem on five years of formal felony probation and ordered him to serve 210 days in the county jail and to stay away from the victim, his father. neither defense counsel nor the prosecution raised any issue regarding penal code section 654. issue le contention on appeal is that the trial court should have stayed his sentence on one of the two counts under penal code section 654. the attorney general implicitly concedes moallem cannot be punished for both the criminal threats and the assault, but argues the court did not err because between (1) the suspension of execution of a sentence the court has imposed and (2) a grant of probation in which the court suspends imposition of sentence. 4 discussion under penal code section 954,1 a person may be convicted of more than one crime arising out of the same act or course of conduct. (people v. sloan (2007) 42 cal.4th 110, 116.) its counterpart, section 654, prohibits multiple punishment for the same act or indivisible course of conduct. (sloan, at p. 116; see also neal v. california 954 permits multiple conviction, but section 654 prohibits multiple punishment, the trial court must stay execution of sentence on the conviction for which multiple punishment is sloan, at p. 116; see also people v. ortega (1998) 19 cal.4th 686, 692.) moallem contends section 654 applies to his two convictions here.2 he notes his verbal threats against his father and his stabbing motions toward his father with the knife were part of one indivisible transaction. the attorney general does not dispute this contention. instead, the attorney general argues multiple sentences are actually imposed, and not when imposition of the additional sentences is stayed in favor of grantin 1 all statutory references are to the penal code. 2 a(people v. scott (1994) 9 cal.4th 331, 354, fn. 17; see also people v. perez (1979) 23 cal.3d 545, 549-550, fn. 3.) 5 the attorney general cites people v. wittig (1984) 158 cal.app.3d 124, 137. in that case, wittig and his codefendant were convicted of assault with a deadly weapon, a firearm, as well as discharging a firearm at an occupied motor vehicle. (id. at p. 126.) the court suspended imposition of sentence and placed the defendants on probation. the issue on appeal concerned jury instructions. at the end of the opinion, the subjected to double punishment in violation of section 654, in receiving concurrent sentences for assault with a deadly weapon and shooting at an occupied motor vehicle. imposition of sentence was suspended; each defendant was granted probation as to each offense. because sentence was not imposed on either defendant, there is no double punishment issue. the section 654 issue should be presented to a court upon any future attempt to impose a double punishment upon either of these defendants in the event of a probaid. at p. 137, italics added.) here, by contrast, the trial court did sentence moallem. it pronounced judgment. the court suspended execution of the sentence it imposed. if moallem were to violate his probation, the court then would execute the suspended sentence. generally, change [the] final judgment and is required to order into people v. martinez (2015) 240 cal.app.4th 1006, 1012; see also people v. howard (1997) 16 cal.4th 1081, 1095; people v. chagolla (1984) 151 cal.app.3d 1045, 1049.) however, if the previously imposed but suspended sentence was unlawful, revocation of probation does not remove the courin re renfrow (2008) 164 cal.app.4th 1251, 1254.) 6 as the attorney general implicitly concedes, moallem cannot be punished twice for the same conduct. the sentence the court imposed was erroneous, even though execution of that sentence was suspended. if moallem violates his probation, the court at that juncture will have to correct the sentence. the trial court should have imposed a sentence for each of the two counts, but then stayed the section 654-barred count. (people v. alford (2010) 180 cal.app.4th 1463, 1466.) the error should be corrected now; there is no reason to wait.3 3 section 654, subdivision (a), be punished under the provision that provides for the longest , the longest potential term for each of the two countscriminal threats, with the knife use enhancement, anis four years. accordingly, the trial court may choose either count as the count on which it sentences moallem. 7 disposition to impose sentence on both counts and then stay the sentence on the second count (count 1 or 4, as it chooses) under penal code section 654. not to be published in the official reports egerton, j. we concur: lavin, acting p. j. currey, j.* * judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
