[unintelligible.] fuck. 1 is obviously a typo. 4 ii. procedural history the people charged defendant with (1) attempted murder (pen. code,  187, subd. (a), 664); (2) evading an officer with willful disregard (veh. code,  2800.2); and (3) assault on a police officer with a deadly weapon, a car ( 245, subd. (c)). the people further alleged that attempted murder was committed willfully, deliberately and with premeditation ( 664, subd. (a)), that defendant personally discharged a firearm causing great bodily injury ( 12022.53, subd. (d)), that defendant personally discharged a firearm ( 12022.53, subd. (c)), that defendant personally used a firearm ( 12022.53, subd. (b)), and that defendant inflected great bodily injury ( 12022.7, subd. (a)). the matter proceeded to trial, and a jury convicted defendant of all three crimes, and found true all of the firearm and great bodily injury allegations; the jury found not true the allegation that the attempted murder was committed willfully, deliberately and with premeditation. the trial court sentenced defendant to state prison for 33 years and four monthsseven years on the attempted murder count plus an additional 25 years for personally discharging a firearm causing great bodily injury, plus 16 months (one-third the mid-term) on the assault on a police officer count. the court imposed a two year sentence on the evasion count, but ran it concurrently to the others. defendant filed a timely appeal. discussion on appeal, defendant raises two issues: (1) the trial court erred, under evidence code section 352, in admitting the beginning portion of the jailhouse telephone conversation; and, alternatively, (2) the court erred in not giving an instruction limiting under evidence code section 352 (people v. lancaster discretion. (people v. merriman (2014) 60 cal.4th 1, 74.) we review the second claim of instructional error de novo. (people v. fiore (2014) 227 cal.app.4th 1362, 1378.) there was no error. 5 its probative value is substantially outweighed by the probability that its admission will (a) necessitate undue consumption of time or (b) create substantial danger of undue people v. lee (2011) 51 cal.4th 620, 643.) citing section 352, defendant asked the trial court to redact the above-quoted portion of the jailhouse call on the ground that a jury might speculate that the was code for a the trial court denied deferequest. the court explained that the beginning portions of the conversation are relevant is in turn relevant to rebut the court conversely found that nothing in the beginning portion at it was the trial court did not abuse its discretion in coming to this conclusion. read in reference to a prior agreement bthe friend expresses shock and surprise (which is inconsistent with a pre-. indeed, defendant testified to precisely this explanation of their conversation at trial. under these circumstances, the court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the relevance of this evidence to not outweighed by the remote danger that the jury might speculate that defendant and his friend were having a coded conversation about a nefarious plot to kill akopyan. 6 consideration of this evidence for certain purposes. defendant never requested such an instruction, and a trial court is under no duty to give a limiting instruction absent a request for one. (people v. hernandez (2004) 33 cal.4th 1040, 1051; evid. code,  355.) defendant argues that his motion for redaction constitutes an implicit request for such an instruction, but we decline to create an exception for implicit requests that would effectively swallow the general rule requiring explicit ones. defendant further asserts dominant part of the evidence against the accused, and is both highly prejudicial and hernandez, at pp. 1051-1052, quoting people v. farnam (2002) 28 cal.4th 107, 163-164.) this narrow exception does not apply here. the portion of the jailhouse conversation defendant protests lasted only seconds, and is in which him during the melee following the initial shots, the presence of disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. _______________________, j. hoffstadt we concur: __________________________, acting p.j. ashmann-gerst __________________________, j. chavez
