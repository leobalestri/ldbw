was false. appellant cites nothing in the record that supports his presumption or that 3 during a june 12, 2013 marsden counsel represented the with whom osby jointly owned the store. 5 2. defense evidence. in defense, appellant, who had suffered 1997, 2001, and 2010 felony narcotics convictions, and a 1999 felony conviction for a crime of moral turpitude, testified as the sole defense witness as follows. on the date of the present incident, appellant tried to explain to osby the arcade machine robbed appellant of $50. appellant kicked the machine to show osby the slot where coins ejected was not working properly. osby told him to leave. appellant exited the store. appellant said he would stay away if osby gave appellant the money belonging to appellant. osby hit appellant with a shoe. appellant pulled out knives to protect himself. osby reached for a weapon. it appeared to be a black .38-caliber revolver. osby said appellant needed to leave before osby shot him. appellant replied osby would go to jail if he shot appellant outside the store. appellant left. he never threatened to kill osby. appellant denied speaking to los angeles rturo ortiz. 3. rebuttal evidence. in rebuttal, ortiz testified on february 1, 2013, he spoke with appellant following his detention. appellant never told ortiz that osby produced a .38-caliber handgun and pointed it at appellant. appellant told ortiz the machine stole $120 from appellant and he was trying to get it back, but appellant never said how he was trying to get it back. we will present additional facts in our discussion where pertinent. issues appellant claims (1) the prosecutor committed misconduct during jury argument, (2) the trial court erroneously failed to instruct on attempted criminal threats as a lesser inclun as a strike, (5) the trial court erred by imposing the penal code section 667.5, subdivision (b) enhancement, (6) appellant is entitled to additional precommitment credit, and (7) penal code section 654 barred multiple punishment on counts 1 and 2. 6 discussion 1. no prosecutorial misconduct occurred during jury argument. during opening argument, the prosecutor made challenged comments quoted below, and we italicize comments appellant underlined when quoting them in his opening edibility and testimony he was not armed with a gun,4 the prosecutor commented, help the community in lynwood. and you also heard that during the 15 or 20 years that he was the owner of this mini mart, he has never been robbed. there no reason why he would be armed with a gun a video, the prosecutor commented, additionally, [osby] admitted weaknesses. [he] was truthful with you. he said, you know, i defendant. he was being truthful with youthe prosecutor also commented police corroborated and lastly, he was not impeached. you osby. 4 osby testified at trial he did not have a gun and did not use one to protect his store, in part because he ran a youth organization and did not want to kill anyone. osby indicated he hit appellant in the chest with the shoe because he wanted appellant to leave, the s, 7 during closing argument, the prosecutor commented he would have loved to have had everything. you get your common sense and you put it together with the . . . percipient witnesses. and if you believe mr. osby believe him. he the prosecutor then cd the tape. you know, he came in here and he told you how it was, admitted weaknesses. came up like a stand-up guy. why do you need the tape? i would love that tape, . [everything] we do in our daily lives, we listen to other people. we determine credibility. every time we go to the store, we determine credibility. [you] for everything to make a decision. appellant claims the above comments were prosecutorial misconduct. he argues the prosecutor was improperly vouching for osby and stating on personal belief osby (1) was honest and credible, (2) was not armed, and (3) inadvertently lost the tape. appellant also argues the prosecutor improperly assured the jury osby was telling the truth when the prosecutor implied the tape would not help appellant even though the prosecutor had not viewed it. we conclude otherwise. appellant failed to object on the ground of prosecutorial misconduct and failed to request a jury admonition with respect to any of the challenged comments, and a jury admonition would have cured any harm. appellant waived any issues of prosecutorial misconduct. (cf. people v. redd (2010) 48 cal.4th 691, 741 (redd); people v. mincey (1992) 2 cal.4th 408, 471.) as to the merits, a prosecutor is given wide latitude during argument, and said argument may be vigorous as long as it amounts to fair comment on the evidence, including reasonable inferences drawn therefrom. (people v. hill (1998) 17 cal.4th 800, 819.) assurances regarding the apparent honesty or reliability ofa witness based on the facts of [the] record and the inferences reasonably drawn [citation.] but a prosecutor is prohibited from vouching for the credibility of witnesses or otherwise bolstering the veracity of their testimony by 8 referring to evidence outside the record. [citation.] redd, supra, 48 cal.4th at p. 740.) in the present case, the challenged prosecutorial comments were based on evidence and did not refer to evidence outside the record. they were fair comment on the evidence and did prosecutorial misconduct occurred. although appellant suggests there was conflicting evidence concerning whether (1) osby was credible, (2) he threatened appellant, (3) osby was armed with a gun, and/a tape was inadvertent, the prosecutor was not obligated to comment on any evidence favorable to appellant. 2. the trial court did not err by failing to instruct on attempted criminal threats. appellant claims the trial court erred by failing to instruct on attempted criminal threats as a lesser included offense of criminal threats, a violation of penal code section 422 (count 2). appellant argues there was substantial evidence he committed only attempted criminal threats because there was substantial evidence osby did not have aning of the section. appellant argues in this regard, inter alia, to the time he retreated behind the bullet- penal code section 422 when it is for a period that extends beyond what is momentary, fleeting, or transitory. (people v. allen (1995) 33 cal.app.4th 1149, 1156.) based on the jury instructions argument, appellant was prosecuted for criminal threats based on his oral threat to kill we have set forth the pertinent facts in our factual summary, and there was substantial evidence as follows. appellant orally threatened to kill osby and pulled out the larger knife. appellant then approached osby with the knives. there is no dispute there was sufficient evidence appellant committed assault with a deadly weapon, i.e., a 9 knife (count 1).5 appellant stopped only because osby pretended he had a gun. appellant was then only two feet from osby. once osby was inside the store, he did not come back outside. the jury reasonably could have concluded that, after appellant left, osby was uncertain about what appellant would do or if appellant would return. police did not come immediately; osby testified police pretty quick[ly],perhaps three or four minutes after osby called. osby waited behind bulletproof glass until police arrived. we conclude there was no substantial evidence fear was momentary, fleeting, or transitory. we realize osby testified he felt safe once he was behind the bulletproof glass. osby may not have feared appellant could successfully attack osby while osby was behind the glass, but there was substantial evidence osby continued to have sustained fear for his safety even while he was behind the glass, because he did not emerge from behind it until police arrived. in light of all the evidence, we conclude the trial court did not err by failing to instruct on attempted criminal threats as a lesser included offense of criminal threats (count 2) because there was no submomentary, fleeting or transitory. 3. no ineffective assistance of counsel occurred. in the present case, the jury instruction concerning any failure by osby to preserve any recording of the present incident. appellant claims his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to ask the trial any such recording. appellaobstruct justice, falsely accused appellant, and wanted to get rid of him. 5 in people v. fierro we believe that the minute during which [the victim] heas weapon qualifies as sustained under the statute. when one believes he is about to die, a momentary, fleeting, or transitory. 10 manner challenged, the record does not reflect said counsel was asked for an explanation and failed to provide one, and we cannot say there simply could have been no satisfactory explanation. (cf. people v. mendoza tello (1997) 15 cal.4th 264, 266-268.) for those reasons alone, no ineffective assistance of counsel occurred. moreover, we can conceive of reasons why the instruction at issue.6 finally, econstitutionally-deficient representation, there is no need to reverse the judgment. even if a recording might have assisted the jury in determining the credibility of osby and appellant, appellant admitted he previously had suffered numerous felony convictions. testimony was fabricated. any constitutionally-deficient representation was not prejudicial. (see 6 sonably could have concluded as follows. first, it was not clear any camera recorded the incident. second, there was substantial evidence from recordings when making new ones. osby did not testify as to the length of time between a previous recording and its erasure, whether or how an erasure could be timely stopped, whether or how a previous recording could be copied, the duration of any copying process, or the impact of any such process on the continued business operation of the camera. the feasibility of preserving a recording was unclear. third, according to the incident. he viewed the present incident as a common incident of misbehavior by a customer, and osby did not normally preserve evidence of those incidents. a detective called osby a month after the incident. there was no evidence police ever notified osby he needed to preserve any recording. the need to preserve a recording was unclear. fourth, none of the authorities or instructions (e.g., calcrim no. 371, caci no. 204, or baji no. 2.03, the last two of which are civil jury instructions) appellant now suggests his trial counsel could have relied upon to ask for the instruction at issue applied in this case. 11 people v. slaughter (2002) 27 cal.4th 1187, 1219; people v. ledesma (1987) 43 cal.3d 171, 216-217.) 4. the trial court erred by relying upon 99 conviction as a strike. a. pertinent facts. the pertinent facts in this case revolve around four areas: (1) the 1999 conviction proceedings, (2) appellants 2008 motion to dismiss the 1999 conviction, (3) the 2008 dismissal of the 1999 conviction, and (4) the 2013 court trial on the strike allegation based on the 1999 conviction. (1) evidence of the 1999 conviction proceedings. the information in this case alleged, inter alia, appellant suffered a strike based on a january 15, 1999 conviction for a violation of penal code section 422 in case no. ba173853. the trial court in the present case conducted, on september 9, 2013, a court trial on the strike allegation (hereafter, court trial). evidence introduced at the court trial did not include a reporters transcript of the 1999 plea proceeding in case no. ba173853.7 a january 15, 1999 minute order in case no. ba173853 was admitted into evidence at the court trial. said minute order reflects on january 15, 1999, appellant pled no contest to a violation of penal code section 422. the january 15, 1999 minute order also reflects that, on that date, in case no. ba173853, the trial court suspended imposition of sentence and placed appellant on probation for one year, and a condition of appellants probation was [i]f the defendant obeys all laws for one year then the people will move to dismiss the case. the january 15, 1999 minute order does not specify a penal code section upon which the people would rely to move to dismiss the case. 7 the court reporter for the january 15, 1999 proceedings retired, and court reporteare destroyed after 10 years; therefore, transcripts of the january 15, 1999 proceedings could not be prepared. we note this statement does not say transcripts of the january 15, 1999 proceedings were never prepared. it appears, as discussed betranscript of the 1999 proceedings may have existed at one time. 12 nothing in the record indicates that, after one year following appellants no contest plea, the people ever moved to dismiss case no. ba173853. no pertinent proceedings occurred after january 15, 1999, until the below discussed 2008 matters. (2) the 2008 motion to dismiss the 1999 conviction. on october 1, 2008, in case no. ba173853, appellant filed a notice of motion to dismiss (specific performance of plea), motion to withdraw plea/petition for coram nobis (hereafter, motion). the notice of motion stated appellant would make a motion to dismiss based on specific performance of his plea agreement or in the alternative will move for a grant of a writ of coram nobis or to withdraw his plea based on having pled solely on the ground that his counsel, the court and the people represented that this matter would be dismissed for all purposes one year after the entry of the plea. appellants motion stated, mr. [duboise] demands specific performance of the plea agreement of january 15, [1999], he entered into in this case. in the plea agreement he was specifically promised that the people would move to dismiss this case a year from the date of the entry of his plea if he obeyed all laws and did not contact the victim or witnesses in the case. [] if the court will not dismiss the case in a manner which renders the conviction a nullity, mr. [duboise] in the alternative requests to withdraw his plea. this alternative request is itself also alternatively termed a petition for writ of coram nobis. this is because in choosing to accept the plea agreement, mr. [duboise] relied on the interpretations and promises of his lawyer in warranting that the explicit statements of the court[8] and the prosecutor to the effect that the case would be dismissed were in fact what they sounded like, a promise that the case would be dismissed in all respects without the possibility that the conviction would be used against him in any way. 8 the motion indicated the judge at the time of the 1999 no contest plea (judge john harris) had retired. 13 appellants motion later indicated the colloquy leading to his no contest plea evidenced the peoples promise to dismiss the case induced his plea.9 the motion also stated appellant would have never entered a plea on this case but for the prosecutors commitment to dismiss the case, a dismissal he felt was to be for all purposes. the motion further stated, mr. [duboise]reliance on the representations he was made is reasonable. he was a lay person, and all three of the parties with whom he was interacting used the word dismiss or dismissal without any limitations. mr. [duboise], as a lay person, cannot be deemed to have understood anything different from what he claims, that a dismissal would be for all purposes. even if the parties intended that the dismissal was to be something similar to a 1203.2 [sic] dismissal. the motion contains an alleged declaration from appellant (not signed under penalty of perjury but apparently signed by him; hereafter, declaration). the declaration stated, on the day my trial was to start, my lawyer told me that he had had a meeting with the prosecutor and the judge. he told me that if i pled no contest on that date, the district attorney would dismiss the case in a year if i had no negative contacts with law enforcement. as i had a child with my ex and we had been having disagreements about visitation, i did not want to take that deal if the conviction was going to stay on my 9 the motion stated, this inducement is reflected at several points in the plea colloquy. immediately after stating [its] understanding that a plea was going to be entered as to the section 422 charge, the court stated: it is my further understanding that if the defendant obeys all laws for a period of one year after having been placed on unsupervised probation, the people a [year] from today will move to dismiss the case against mr. [duboise]. plea colloquy of january 15, 1999 at page 2, lines 10-14. hereinafter plea. [see fn. 7, ante.] [] this understanding was echoed by deputy district attorney musso. after the courts statement of the agreement quoted above, mr. musso indicated that he agreed, but for a statement indicating that . . . mr. [duboise] staying away from and not harming the victim and another civilian witness was an additional term. plea at 2, lines 15-19. [] the prosecutor himself echoed mr. [duboise] expectation that the case would be dismissed by referring to the disposition as a probationary one, with the opportunity to the defendant to have the case dismissed if he stays away and does not harass the civilian witness (plea at 4, lines 4-7) and then telling mr. [duboise] directly, i dont think i mentioned that after a period of one year the case may be dismissed if you are not having problems. plea at 4, lines 26-28. 14 record for any purpose. . . . i discussed this concern with my lawyer assured [sic] me that the case would be dismissed and would never be used against me as long as i stayed out of trouble for one year. appellant decided to plead no contest. the declaration later stated, if i had not believed that the case would be dismissed for all purposes and would not remain on my record as represented to me by my lawyer, the judge, and the prosecutor, i would not have pled no contest to the charge. i was never told by my lawyer or anyone else that the matter would be dismissed in any manner that would not be a dismissal for all purposes, and i was not aware that there was such a thing in california as a dismissal that would allow the case to still be considered a conviction for any purpose after the date of dismissal. [] i did not have any contact with the victim or commit any new crime for more than a year after the date i entered my plea of no contest. the motion does not expressly specify a penal code section upon which dismissal of the case would be based. (3) the 2008 dismissal of the 1999 conviction. of december 12, 2008 proceedings in case no. ba173853. the transcript reflects on december 12, 2008, the trial court (judge gary hahn) in case no. ba173853, in the presence of appellant and counsel for both parties, indicated appellant had filed a ting to that case. (the petition was the motion.) the court asked the [a]nything [he wished] to add . . . replied no. written motionthe plea is withdrawn, and the case dismissed. not expressly specify a penal code section upon which the court relied to dismiss the case. 15 the december 12, 2008 minute order was admitted into evidence at the court trial. penal code. plea of guilty or conviction is set aside. a plea of not guilty is entered. some capitalization omitted.) the minute order then states, is dismissed: dismissed pursuant to [penal code section] 1203.4[.] notice of motion to dismiss (specific performance of plea), withdrawn plea/petition for coram nobis filed on 10-01-(italics added, some capitalization omitted.) (4) the 2013 court trial. at the september 9, 2013 court trial, the court, and counsel for the parties, indicated they had counsel represented, concerning the 1999 conviction, indicated inadvertent ministerial error the 1999 conviction had not been reduced to a misdemeanor during the 1999 plea proceedings. at the court trial, the prosecutor represented the 1999 conviction and the prosecutor objected to any reduction of the 1999 conviction to a misdemeanor. the trial court in the present case later stated was dismissed pursuant to penal code section 1202.4 [sic]. no, it was dismissed pursuant to penal code section 120 10 the trial reduced to a misdemeanor, and the court disagrees with the defense that that is normally done. even in the 1203.4 motions to dismiss, quite often the case is dismissed without 10 at no time in this case did penal code section 1202.4 pertain to dismissals, and at no time in this case did a penal code section 1200.4 exist. 16 misdemeanor in this case, and although the case was dismissed, it is my understanding that under the current law, that it stprosecutor agreed with the court, and the court later received evidence of the 1999 conviction as previously discussed. after presentation of evidence and argument, the parties submitted the matter and the court found true the allegation appellant suffered a strike based on the 1999 conviction for a violation of penal code section 422. b. analysis. appellant claims the trial court in the present case could not rely on his 1999 conviction as a strike because, on december 12, 2008, the trial court in case no. ba173853 dismissed that case pursuant to penal code section 1385. we agree. a negotiated plea agreement is a form of contract, and it is interpreted according (people v. shelton (2006) 37 cal.4th 759, 767 (shelton).) using the paradigm of contract law, courts should look first to the specific language of the agreement to ascertain the expressed intent of the parties. [citations.] beyond that, the courts should seek to carry out the parties reasonable expectations. (people v. nguyen (1993) 13 cal.app.4th 114, 120, fn. omitted.) the mutual intention to which the courts give effect is determined by objectiv intent, including the words used in the agreement, as well as extrinsic evidence of such objective matters as the surrounding circumstances under which the parties negotiated or entered into the contract; the object, nature and subject matter of the contract; and the subsequent conduct of the parties. [citations.] (shelton, supra, 37 cal.4th at p. 767.) pursuant to which, in essence, he pled no contest with the understanding (1) the court would place him on probation for a year on the condition, inter alia, he obey all laws, and (2) if he complied with that condition, the people would move to dismiss the case. the issue is the nature of the agreement, if any, concerning future use of the 1999 conviction in the event, pursuant to the agreement, the people moved to dismiss the case. 17 respondent concedes [1999] conviction as a prior . . . claim that the conviction was dismissed under [penal code] section 1385 rather than [penal code] that is, there is no dispute the 2008 dismissal of the 1999 conviction was pursuant either to section 1385 or section 1203.4. penal code section 1385, subdiv. may, either of his or her own motion or upon the application of the prosecuting attorney, and in permits a trial court to dismiss a caprobation conditions. it is an expungement proceeding. (see people v. laino (2004) 32 cal.4th 878, 885; people v. boyd (1979) 24 cal.3d 285, 294.) the defendant is permitted to withdraw his or her no contest plea and enter a plea of not guilty, the court ( 1203.4, subd. (a))11 resulting from the offense of which the defendant was convicted. we look initially to the 1999 plea bargain to determine under which section, 1385 or 1203.4, the 1999 conviction was dismissed in 2008. first, according to the january 15, 1999 minute order, appellant pled no contest with the understanding if he obeyed all laws for one yea the case. the in the minute order is without qualificationis 12 minute order reasonably implied the 1999 would not be used as a strike in the future. 11 the pertinent subdivisions of penal code section 1203.4 in 1999 and 2008 are substantively the same, except the 2008 versions have been renumbered, and except as indicated post. 12 merriam- 18 in people v. barro (2001) 93 cal.app.4th 62 (barro), dismissal under [penal code] section 1385 of the charge underlying a prior conviction which would otherwise qualify as a strike precludes the use of that prior conviction as a strike under (id. at p. 64.) on the other hand, a dismissal pursuant to penal code section 1203.4 does not prevent future use of the dismissed prior conviction as a strike. (people v. diaz (1996) 41 cal.app.4th 1424, 1429-1430; pen. code,  1203.4, fact that, as between section 1385 and 1203.4, only a dismissal under section 1385 would preclude future use of a dismissed prior conviction as a strike, the reasonable expectation would be pursuant to penal code section 1385. this is corroborated by the fact the january 15, 1999 minute order reflects the penal code section 1385, subdivision (a) upon the application of the prosecuting attorney, . . . order an (italics added.) on the other hand, penal code section probationer may make the application and change of relief under subdivision (a).13 subdivision (e) precludes relief under section 1203.4 unless the prosecuting attorney is given nowhere does the section indicate the people can move for dismissal. the fact the 1999 plea bargain called for the people to move to dismiss the case points to a dismissal that was not pursuant to section 1203.4. 13 o be a petition under penal code section 1203.4. instead, it was an alternative petition for a writ of error coram nobis. the reference to subdivision (c)(2) above is to the subdivision as it existed in 2008, and subdivision (c)(2) did not appear in the 1999 version of the section. 19 that the reasonable expectation of the parties was that any dismissal of the 1999 conviction would preclude its use as a strike, and therefore would be a dismissal pursuant to penal code section 1385, is confirmed by the subsequent conduct of the parties and the court. first, appellant, in his october 2008 motion, including in his supporting declaration, made it abundantly clear it was his position that, at the time of the 1999 no contest plea, appellant, his counsel, the prosecutor, and the court understood dismissal of the 1999 conviction pursuant to the plea bargain would preclude its use as a strike. second, at the december 12, 2008 dismissal proceedings, the court asked the [a]nything [he wished] to add . . . 2008 proceedings was not the same prosecutor who was present during the 1999 conviction proceedings, the prosecutor at the 2008 proceedings presumably had read this was a motion that maintained that, during the 1999 plea proceedings, ourt and the people represented that this matter would be dismissed for all purposes one year after the entry of his (italics added.) the motion asked the court on december 12, 2008, renders the conviction a nullity(italics added.) the motion indicated that during the 1999 plea proceedings, dismissed in all respects without the possibility that the conviction would be used against him in any way (italics added.) be dismissed and would never be used against me as long as i stayed out of trouble for one nonetheless, when, during the december 12, 2008 proceedings, the court invited comment by the proanything to add. that is, the prosecutor did not his motion, concerning the plea bargain. 20 third, during the december 12, 2008 proceedings, the trial court did not dispute the plea bargain. and that motion called for the court to dismiss the 1999 conviction as specific performance of 1999 plea bargain. the trial court, on december 12, 2008, was well-written and granted it.14 indeed, the trial court statedexist 15 (italics added.) fourth, even during the court trial, the prosecutor stated, the 1999 conviction had been . we conclude the trial court, on december 12, 2008, dismissed case no. ba173853 pursuant to penal code section 1385. the problem in this case stems from two facts. on the one hand, (1) the 1999 plea october 2008 december 12, 2008 dismissal proceedings, and (4) the prosec9, 2013 court trial, demonstrate the dismissal of case no. ba173853 was pursuant to penal code section 1385. on the other hand, the minute order of the december 12, 2008 dismissal proceedings indicates, and the comments of the trial court at the court trial suggest, dismissal was pursuant to penal code section 1203.4. depends upon the circumstances in each case. (people v. smith (1983) 33 cal.3d 596, 599.) in light of the clear expressions dismissal would preclude use of the 1999 conviction as a strike, i.e., clear expressions dismissal would be pursuant to penal code 12, 2008 minute order indicating 14 the trial court implicitly had obeyed all laws during the year after his no contest plea. during the december 12, 2008 proceedings, the people indicated they had nothing to add, and never suggested appellant had violated any laws or terms of his probation. 15 the trial court did not require the people to make a motion to dismiss pursuant to penal code section 1385. instead, the trial court, on its own motion, dismissed the case pursuant to that section. 21 dismissal was pursuant to penal code section 1203.4, we conclude the clear expressions prevail over the minute order. moreover, those clear expressions prevail over the vague comments of the september 9, 2013 trial court suggesting dismissal was pursuant to penal code section 1203.4. that suggestion is consistent with ultimate conclusion the 1999 conviction could be used as a strike. however, the only documents available to the trial court on september 9, 2013, when it made that suggestion, were the january 15, 1999 minute order, transcript and minute order, i.e., documents clearly indicating dismissal would be pursuant to penal code section 1385. penal code section 1385, subdivision (a) requires that when an action is dismissed 2, 2008 minute order indicated dismissal was pursuant to penal code section 1203.4, not section 1385. however, based on the previous analysis, the minute order was in error. moreover, in this case, dismissal rement of a statement of reasons in the minutes, because the dismissal implemented a plea bargain. (people v. bonnetta (2009) 46 cal.4th 143, 153, fn. 5.) we hold the 1999 conviction may not be used as a strike because case no. ba173853 was previously dismissed pursuant to penal code section 1385 (barro, supra, 93 cal.app.4th at p. 68);16 therefore, we will reverse the true finding as to strike allegation and dismiss it with prejudice. we will also 16 we asked for supplemental briefing on the impact, if any, of garcia v. superior court (1997) 14 cal.4th 953, and especially people v. level (2002) 97 cal.app.4th 1208, n level, maintains that, because level is misplaced because, in level, unlike in the present case, the defendant received the benefit of his bargain. appellant did not receive that benefit because part of his bargain was the people would move to dismiss the case pursuant to penal code section 1385 and that did not happen. in light of our analysis, there is no need to reach the issue of whether the 1999 conviction was reduced to a misdemeanor with the result it could not be used as a strike. 22 (cf. people v. stevens (1988) 205 cal.app.3d 1452, 1455-1458; people v. savala (1983) 147 cal.app.3d 63, 66-70.) we express no opinion concerning remand. 5. imposition of the penal code section 667.5, subdivision (b) enhancement was proper. 1 and 2 pursuant to penal code section 667.5(b) (italics added.) the information then alleged two prior convictions (one in 1997, the other in 2001), a may 7, 2010 conviction in case no. ta111128 for a violation of health and as described in penal code section 667.5 for said offense(s), and that the defendant did not remain free of prison custody for, and did commit an offense resulting in a felony conviction during, a period (italics added.) penal code section 667.5, subdivision (b), in relevant part, requires a one- at the september 9, 2013 court trial on the prior conviction allegations, and after appellant consulted dmit the one-year prior[]code section 667.5(b), one-(sic.) after appellant was advised of his rights, the following occurred: prosecutor:] do you give up those rights and admit that you suffered a conviction back on may 7, 2010, los angeles superior court in case number ta111128 for violation of health and safety code section 11351.5? do you admit or deny that prior conviction, stated without objection[appellant] has admitted to three one-year priors pursuant to penal code section 667[, subdivision] (sic.) -23 year for the penal code section 667.5, subdivision (b) enhancement based on case no. ta111128. the court struck the remainin appellant claims imposition of the penal code section 667.5, subdivision (b) enhancement based on case no. ta111128 was improper because he did not admit he served a separate prison term for that prior conviction. we reject the claim. appellant correctly concedes during the september 9, 2013 court trial, he admitted he suffered the prior conviction in case no. ta111128. appellant, who was represented by counsel, thereby admitted as great a charge as was contained in the information, which effectively alleged he served a separate prison term for that prior conviction. accordingly, appellant admitted he suffered the prior conviction in case no. ta111128 and served a separate prison term therefor within the meaning of penal code section 667.5, subdivision (b). the trial court properly imposed the one-year enhancement based on that prior conviction. (cf. people v. cardenas (1987) 192 cal.app.3d 51, 61 (cardenas); people v. welge (1980) 101 cal.app.3d 616, 623-624; see people v. ebner (1966) 64 cal.2d 297, 303-304; people v. martinez (1985) 175 cal.app.3d 881, 894-895.)17 6. appellant is entitled to additional precommitment credit. appellant was arrested on february 1, 2013, and remained in custody until the court sentenced him on september 9, 2013, a total of 221 days, inclusive. on september 9, 2013, the trial court awarded appellant a total of 253 days of precommitment credit, consisting of 220 days of custody credit and 33 days of conduct credit. appellant claims he is entitled to 221 days of custody credit and 221 days of conduct credit. we partially agree. he is entitled to 221 days of custody credit. (people 17 people v. golde (2008) 163 cal.app.4th 101 (golde), cited by appellant, does not compel a contrary conclusion. golde concluded an admission to a prior conviction for negligent discharge of a firearm did not establish personal use of the firearm, a requirement for the prior conviction to qualify as a strike. however, golde did not discuss cardenas or the other cases cited above. in the present case, the information effectively alleged appellant served a separate prison term for the prior conviction in case no. ta111128. golde did not discuss whether the information in that case alleged personal use of the firearm. cases are not authority for propositions not considered. 24 v. smith (1989) 211 cal.app.3d 523, 525-527; pen. code,  2900.5, subd. (a).) there is no dispute appellant is entitled to conduct credit as calculated under penal code section 4019, effective october 1, 2011. he is entitled to 220 days (not 221 days) of conduct credit. (people v. chilelli (2014) 225 cal.app.4th 581, 588; pen. code,  4019, subds. (b), (c); see in re marquez (2003) 30 cal.4th 14, 25-26.) appellant is thus entitled to one additional day of custody credit and 187 additional days of conduct credit.18 the trial court must amend its september 9, 2013 sentencing minute order, and the abstract of judgment, accordingly. (cf. people v. humiston (1993) 20 cal.app.4th 460, 466; people v. solorzano (1978) 84 cal.app.3d 413, 415, 417.) 7. penal code section 654 prohibits multiple punishment on counts 1 and 2. a concurrent four years on count 2, plus one year for the penal code section 12022, subdivision (b)(1) enhancement as to count 2.19 respondent concedes penal code section 654 barred punishment on count 2 (which, as between counts 1 and 2, has the lesser sentence). we accept the concession. (see people v. bradley (2003) 111 cal.app.4th 765, 769, fn. 3.) 18 penal code section 2933.1, subdivisions (a) and (c), when applicable, limit a precommitment conduct credit award to 15 percent of the custody credit award. the fact 33 is 15 percent of 220 suggests the trial court applied the 15 percent limitation of subdivisions (a) and (c). respondent concedes that limitation is inapplicable because neither of the present offenses is a violent felony for purposes of penal code section 667.5, subdivision (c), a requirement for application of that limitation. we accept the concession. respondent, without citation to case authority, argues the 20 percent limitation of penal code section 1170.12, subdivision (a)(5) applies. we reject that argument because that limitation applies to postcommitment credits, not precommitment credits. (people v. henson (1997) 57 cal.app.4th 1380, 1385, fn. 5; people v. caceres (1997) 52 cal.app.4th 106, 110.) 19 the court sentenced appellant to prison for eight years on count 1 (the four-year upper term, doubled pursuant to the three strikes law) with a concurrent four years on count 2 (the two-year middle term, doubled pursuant to the three strikes law), plus five years for the penal code section 667, subdivision (a) enhancement and one year for the penal code section 667.5, subdivision (b) enhancement. 25 disposition the judgment is affirmed, except (1) the true finding as to the allegation appellant suffered a strike based on a january 15, 1999 conviction for criminal threats in case no. ba173853 is reversed and the allegation is dismissed with prejudicesentence is vacated, and (3) the matter is remanded for resentencing consistent with this opinion, including parts 4 through 7 of the discussion. the trial court is directed to correct its sentencing minute order accordingly and to forward to the department of corrections an amended abstract of judgment. not to be published in the official reports kitching, j. we concur: klein, p. j. aldrich, j.
