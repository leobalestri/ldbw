2012, we notified any ground or argument he wished to have considered. on july 13, 2012, defendant submitted a brief in which he contends he had ineffective assistance of counsel at the time his plea was entered because his counsel represented to defendant that defendant would not have to return to north carolina to serve the remainder of a prison term in that state if he entered a guilty plea in california. defendant further contends he had valid grounds to file a writ of error corum nobis. our independent review of the record discloses no error by the trial court in , filed in november 2011, based on information he obtained in 2004 and 2005 regarding his north carolina criminal case. we therefore affirm the judgment. background an information filed on february 16, 1999 charged defendant with second degree robbery in violation of penal code section 2111 (count 1), two counts of assault with a firearm in violation of section 245, subdivision (a)(2) (counts 2 and 3), false imprisonment

otherwise indicated. 3 at the time defendant committed the charged offenses, he had a pending indictment and a pending prison sentence in north carolina. at the february 8, 2001 hearing at which defendant entered his plea, defense counsel told the trial court that he had been in contact with the head of the criminal warrants section of the north carolina carolina, regarding an outstanding 13-count indictment against defendant and an uncompleted prison term in that state. defense counsel stated that during his discussions with the north carolina authorities, he had learned that those authorities would not prosecute the indictment against defendant, nor would they seek his return to complete the prison term, if defendant agreed to serve a 25-year prison term in california. the trial the remaining counts and enhancements alleged in the information, and sentenced defendant to 25 years to life in prison. after defendant arrived at state prison, the north carolina department of correction notified the authorities at north kern state prison in a letter dated july 6, his north carolina prison sentence. defendant thereafter corresponded with the north carolina authorities to obtain a removal of the detainer. in a letter dated june 7, 2004, the north carolina prison authorities advised defendant that the detainer would remain active. the north carolina department of correction reiterated its refusal to remove the detainer in subsequent letters to defendant dated july 7, 2004, june 5, 2006, june 29, 2006, october 10, 2007, march 17, 2011, march 24, 2011, and march

court had assured him the north carolina detainer would be dismissed if he agreed to a 25-year-to-life term in california. this appeal followed. 4 discussion defendant contends his sentence was illegal because his defense counsel at trial, the prosecutor, and the judge represented to him that north carolina authorities would not pursue a conviction and pending charges against him in that state if he agreed to be sentenced in california. defendant claims he relied on those representations as a misrepresentations concerning the north carolina cases against him constituted ineffective

executed and filed a certificate of probable cause. of probable cause as to his ineffective assistance claim precludes appellate review of that claim. (in re chavez (2003) 30 cal.4th 643, 649-651.) raised. defendant received notice in june 2004 that his detainer was active, subjecting him to be returned to north carolina. north carolina authorities confirmed the active status of the detainer in subsequent correspondence with defendant in 2004, 2005, 2006, and 2007; however, defendant did not file his petition for writ of habeas corpus or error corum nobis this court to require that one who belatedly presents a collateral attack such as this on indigent petitioners appearing in propria persona, and is not met by an assertion of counsel that he oin re clark (1993) 5 assertion that the prosecutor and the trial court had represented to him that the north carolina detainer would be dismissed if defendant entered a no contest plea to the california charges alleged against him. 5 that no arguable issue exists. defendant has, by virtue of his appcompliance with the wende procedure and our review of the record, received adequate and effective appellate review of the judgment entered against him in this case. (smith v. robbins (2000) 528 u.s. 259, 278; people v. kelly (2006) 40 cal.4th 106, 112-113.) the judgment is affirmed.
