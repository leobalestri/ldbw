filed 3/13/12 p. v. vega ca2/7 not to be published in the official reports california rules of court, rule 8.1115(a), prohibits courts and parties from citing or relying on opinions not certified for publication or ordered published, except as specified by rule 8.1115(b). this opinion has not been certified for publication or ordered published for purposes of rule 8.1115. in the court of appeal of the state of california second appellate district division seven the people, plaintiff and respondent, v. abundio vega, defendant and appellant. b229402 (los angeles county super. ct. no. va115026) appeal from a judgment of the superior court of los angeles county. michael l. schuur, judge. affirmed. the defenders law group, paul richard peters and lawrence r. young, for defendant and appellant. kamala d. harris, attorney general, dane r. gillette, chief assistant attorney general, pamela c. hamanaka, senior assistant attorney general, scott a. taryle and stephanie a. miyoshi, deputy attorneys general, for plaintiff and respondent. _______________________ 2 abundio vega, convicted of six counts of committing a lewd act upon a child under the age of 14 years (pen. code,  288, subd. (a)) and three counts of oral copulation with a person under the age of 14 years (pen. code,  288a, subd. (c)(1)), appeals his convictions, contending that the trial court failed to instruct the jury on reasonable doubt. as vega fails to demonstrate error, we affirm. factual and procedural background because the issue raised by vega on appeal is unrelated to the evidence in the case, a recitation of the factual background of the matter is unnecessary to resolve the appeal. vega was tried by jury. the trial court instructed the jury prior to deliberations on november 4, 2010. the record includes two transcripts of the proceedings in which the court instructed the jury. one, dated december 21, 2010, and filed with this court in january 2011, does not include calcrim no. 220, the instruction defining reasonable doubt. the other transcript, dated july 12, 2011, and filed in this court on july 15, 2011, reflects that the trial court did read the instruction to the jury. calcrim no. 220 was included in the packet of written jury instructions provided to the jury. discussion that absence of calcrim no. 220 from the first transcript means that the trial court did not instruct the jury with calcrim no. 220. the supplemental reporttranscript shows it included in the jury instructions presented to the jury in written form. vega argues that while the difference between the two reporte 3 was more closely contemporaneous to the triadefense must presume that the first transcript is the correct one and that this vital this court may not presume that the trial court erred or that a discrepancy between transcripts signifies efforts to conceal error. we are required to presume that courts and court reporters follow the applicable law and regularly perform their duties. (evid. code,  people v. wader (1993) 5 cal.4th 610, 661 [evid. code  664 presumption applies to court reporters].) we may not reverse judgments based on speculation that an error may have occurred. it shows that him. (people v. sullivan (2007) 151 cal.app.4th 524, 549.) here, vega has demonstrated a difference between the original transcript and the transcript later in questionaugmented. as the record on appeal does not affirmatively show that the jury was not instructed with calcrim no. 220, vega has not presented a record on which we can find the error he claims has occurred. even if the trial court did neglect to read calcrim no. 220 aloud, moreover, it is undisputed that the instruction was provided to the jury in written form for its use during deliberations. we presume that the jurors were guided by the written copies they received. (people v. osband (1996) 13 cal.4th 622, 687.) while we, like the california of trial judges reading jury instructions with id. at p. 688), any error in the oral recitation of the instructions when the relevant instructions were provided to the jury in writing was harmless under any standard. (see id. at pp. 687-688.) 4 disposition the judgment is affirmed. zelon, j. we concur: perluss, p. j. jackson, j.
