(a)), and that on july 13, 2005, appellant engaged in identity theft and false personation regarding tillett (pen. code,  530.5, subd. (a), 529; counts 7 and 9).1 accompanying the charges were allegations that appellant had been convicted of two serious felonies under the three strikes law ( 667, subds. (b)-(i), 1170.12, subds. (a)-(d)), and had served prison terms for four prior felony convictions ( 667.5, subd. (b)). for purposes of the applicable statute of limitations ( 801.5, 803, subd. (c)), the information alleged that the offenses were not discovered until march 7, 2011. appellant pleaded not guilty and denied the special allegations. the trial was bifurcated with respect to the special allegations regarding appellants prior convictions. after a jury found appellant guilty on all counts, the trial court found the allegations under the three strikes law to be true, and found the prior prison term allegations not to be true. appellant was sentenced to a total term of 13 years in prison. 1 all further statutory citations are to the penal code. 3 facts a. prosecution evidence dennis egbert tillett, jr., testified that he was acquainted with appellant through a sibling. according to tillett, he first obtained a california class c in 1998. thereafter, he maintained the same residence, and renewed his license by visiting the offices of the california department of motor vehicles (dmv). but retained his class c license. in june 2010, insurance company told him that his premiums were to increase because he had several driving tickets. when he obtained the tickets, he discovered that they had been issued in long beach, which he did not visit. tillett notified his local police department and the dmv. later, in december 2010, he filed a report regarding the tickets with the los angeles police department. been issued in his name, although he had applied for no such license. in december 2010, he went to the office of the nevada department of motor vehicles in las vegas, where he spoke to an investigator regarding the name. when the investigator showed tillett a photograph of the person who had applied for the license, tillett recognized that person as appellant. the nevada department of motor vehicles suspended the license. in early 2011, after returning to california, tillett met with dmv investigator avo hagopian. hagopian testified that on march 7, 2011, tillet came to his office and filed a complaint regarding the theft of his identity. according to fraudulently obtained in his name, he was unaware of any similarly fraudulent 4 hagopian further testified regarding the procedure for obtaining a california an applicant first completes a dl-44 application form with the assistance of a dmv technician. aside from requesting certain personal information, the dl-44 form requires applicants to state card under another name within the previous ten years. following a review of the completed dl-44 form by the technician and a dmv manager, the applicant signs the form, and thereby executes a declaration under penalty of perjury that the information provided on the form is true. the applicant is then directed to a second dmv technician , where the photo and thumbprint are taken. according to hagopian, after meeting with tillett, he prior dl-44 applications and soundex photos, and contacted the nevada department of motor vehicles. after noticing that the soundex photo relating to a july 13, 2005 dl-44 form to visit his office. tillett identified appellant as the person shown in the july 13, 2005 soundex photo. -44 forms and soundex photos . had also completed dl-albert eddie jacobs. hagopianinvestigation disclosed the following conduct by appellant. in thereafter, commencing in 1999, appellant secured a total of identification cards using three names, while stating on the pertinent dl-44 forms that within the previous ten years, he had never submitted applications under another name. in 1999 and 2000eddie jacobss in his 5 true name (counts 1 through 3). in early 2005, appellant secured an identification ddie true name (counts 4 and 5). on july 13, 2005, appellant applied for, and obtained, (counts 6, 7, and 9). later, on april 15, 2008, (count 8).2 b. defense evidence appellant presented no evidence. discussion appellant contends the charges against him were time-barred under section 801.5, which states the limitations period applicable to his crimes. he argues that underlying action was initiated within the limitations period. a. governing principles section 801.5 provides that the prosecution of the offenses charged against commission of the offense. ( 801.5, 803, subd. (c).) although the penal code does not specify whose discovery of the offense triggers the limitations period, or responsible law enforcement personnel learn of facts which, if 2 the prosecution also submitted testimony from angela hilliard, a fingerprint person. 6 investigated with reasonable diligence, would make that person aware a crime had occurred. (people v. moore (2009) 176 cal.app.4th 687, 692, italics deleted, quoting people v. kronemyer (1987) 189 cal.app.3d 314, 330-331, italics deleted, disapproved on another ground in people v. whitmer (2014) 59 cal.4th 733, 742.) under this principle, the crucial determination is not the date on which the crime victim had actual notice of circumstances sufficient to make them suspicious of [the offense,] thereby leading them to make inquiries which might have revealed (people v. zamora (1976) 18 cal.3d 538, 571-572, italics deleted; people v. wong (2010) 186 cal.app.4th 1433, 1444-1445.) at trial, the prosecution had the burden of showing by a preponderance of the evidence that the charged offenses were committed within the limitations period. (people v. lopez (1997) 52 cal.app.4th 233, 248.) the jury was instructed with a modified version of calcrim no. 3410, which stated that with the exception of count 8 -- which alleged that on april 15, 2008, appellant engaged -- appellant could not be convicted of the crimes charged against him if they should have been discovered more than four years february 28, 2012. we review the of the charges for the existence of substantial evidence. (people v. wong, supra, 186 cal.app.4th at p. 1444.) b. analysis appellant maintains the prosecution failed to prove that the charges against him were asserted within the limitations period, arguing that the evidence at trial showed that dmv employees should have discovered his criminal conduct in 2005 7 or 2007, more than four years before the underlying action commenced. as explained below, we reject his contention.3 regarding his conviction on count 8, the evidence at trial established that appellant committed the pertinent offense on april 15, 2008, less than four years prior to the commencement of the underlying action on february 28, 2012. as appellant does not dispute the date of the crime or the commencement of the action, the action was not untimely with respect to count 8. (people v. price (2007) 155 cal.app.4th 987, 996.) regarding the remaining counts, the evidence at trial supports the reasonable inference that no victim or law enforcement official should have known earlier than june 2010, when tillett first discovered the tickets issued in long beach.4 appellant contends the dmv had notice of his criminal conduct on july 13, 2005, when tillett sought a class b license in his own name. his arguments rely on processing dl-44 forms. at trial, hagopian stated that the dmv employees who employees have access solely to 3 in addition to asserting a defense under section 801.5 at trial, appellant raised that defense in a pretrial motion to set aside the second amended information ( 995), which the trial court denied. as appellant has not challenged that ruling, he has forfeited any contention of error regarding it. 4 because june 2010 is within the limitations period, it is unnecessary for us to section 801.5. 8 the personal information; furthermore, only the technician can view the soundex photo relating to the most recent dl-44 form. argues that on july 13, 2005, the pertinent dmv technician processing his application should have recognized that he was not tillett due to discrepancies between his appellant argues that in 2007, the dmv technician processing b license should have recognized that tillett was not the person in the soundex photo relating to the july 13, 2005 application. these arguments misapprehend our review for substantial evidence. we do determinations if they are supported by any logical inferences grounded in the evidence. (people v. rodriguez (1999) 20 cal.4th 1, 11-14.) here, the record supports reasonable determinations that the facts available to the dmv employees in 2005 and 2007 triggered no inquiry into potential criminal activity. technician was required to compare soundex photo and accompanying physical description. thus, on july 13, 2005, the dmv technician had soundex photo and physical description relating to the most recent dl-44 form, which was dated march 1999. similarly, in 2007, when tillett applied for a class b license, the dmv technician soundex photo and physical description relating to the july 13, 2005 dl-44 form. under those circumstances, those dmv employees reasonably failed to distinguish appellant from tillett. to begin, we note that their faces manifest a strong resemblance, as shown by 9 13, 2005 soundex photo. the photos display oval-faced individuals with similar difference is attributable to a difference in weight: whereas tillett specified his weight in 2007 as 375 pounds, appellant -- in the name of tillett -- claimed to weigh 325 pounds on july 13, 2005. furthermore, both men are tall: 2007 physical description identifies his height as six feet four inches, and dmv records iy his height variously as six feet two inches or six feet three inches. the jury thus reasonably found that the pertinent dmv technicians lacked uct. in 2007, tillett stated that he was six foot four inches tall and weighed 375 pounds. the dmv technician 2007 dl-44 form and the related physical description, which stated that tillett was six feet five inches tall and weighed 325 pounds. in view of the resemblance between appellant and tillett, those minor differences triggered no reasonable suspicion of a crime. (people v. petronella (2013) 218 cal.app.4th 945, 957 [for purposes of section quasi-financial crimes].) the same is true regarding the pertinent dmv technician who processed appellants july 13, 2005 application , even though 1999 application and soundex photo were not admitted into evidence. in view of the evidence submitted at trial, the jury could reasonable infer that the dmv technician and a related physical description akin to tdescription. because appellant resembles tillett, any dissimilarities between the person in the photo and appellant were reasonably attributed to aging and changes in weight (if any). 10 in a related contention, appellant argues that the dmv technicians, who were trained to detect false applications, had adequate notice of criminal activity dmv records, recognized that the july 13, 2005 soundex photo did not depict tillett. however, hagopian and the dmv technicians were not similarly situated in terms of training or in the facts available to them. according to hagopian, dmv technicians who process dl-44 forms do not receive training comparable to that given dmv criminal investigators. more important, hagopian identified the anomalous july 13, 2005 soundex photo only after being alerted to the potential fraud and reviewing tilledmv record, which included dl-44 forms completed in 1998, 1999, 2005, and 2007, and the related soundex photos. in contrast, the dmv technicians had access only to the then-most recent soundex photo and physical description of tillett. as explained above, the jury reasonably concluded that the minor discrepancies between that were insufficient to alert the dmv employees to criminal misconduct. in sum, there is sufficient evidence to support tappellant were not time-barred. 11 disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports manella, j. we concur: epstein, p. j. collins, j.
