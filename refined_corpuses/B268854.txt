(b)) in a 2006 conviction that were based on prior felony convictions for which he served separate prison terms. taylor claims that the enhancements should be stricken because the felony offenses on which they rested were reduced to misdemeanors in 2015 pursuant to proposition 47, the safe neighborhoods and schools act of 2014 ( 1170.18). we disagree. the reduction of a felony offense to misdemeanor under proposition 47 does not apply retroactively to invalidate sentence enhancements that became final enactmentwrit of habeas corpus and deny relief. factual and procedural background on february 17, 2006, a jury convicted taylor of driving a 10851, subd. (a)). the trial court sentenced taylor to the middle term of three years, doubled to six years as a second strike under the three strikes law ( 667, subds. (b)-(i), 1170.12). the court also imposed four one-year sentence enhancements for prior felony convictions for which taylor served separate prison terms. ( 667.5, subd. (b) (section 667.5(b)). those prior convictions were as follows: a 2002 conviction for possession of a controlled substance (health & saf. code,  11377); a 1996 conviction for 1 unless otherwise noted, all further statutory references are to the penal code. 3 s consent (veh. code,  10851, subd. (a)); a 1998 conviction for burglary ( 459); and a 1994 conviction for petty theft with a prior ( 666). total sentence thus was 10 years. in november 2014, the voters of california enacted proposition 47, which reclassified as misdemeanors certain drug felonies or wobblers (crimes that can be punished as either people v. rivera (2015) 233 cal.app.4th 1085, 1091.) thereafter, taylor petitioned under proposition 47 for the reduction of his 2006 felony convictions for possession of a controlled substance and petty theft with a prior to misdemeanors. on july 7, 2015, the trial court granted that petition. later that month, taylor filed a motion for resentencing in which he asked the court to strike the sentence enhancements that were based on the convictions for possession of a controlled substance and petty theft with a prior that the court had reduced to misdemeanors. at the hearing on motion, the trial court noted that taylor was asking it to apply proposition 47 retroactively to strike enhancements that were the court declined to do that. it stated, not already been sentenced, he probably would be entitled to relief and have those state prison priors not considered for purposes of sentencing. but being that he has already been sentenced . . . the fact that the underlying offense resulting in a prior prison term is now a misdemeanor pursuant to prop[osition] 47 does not change, in my mind, the validity of the enhancement . . . accordingly, the court denied the motion. 4 taylor filed a notice of appeal from the order denying the motion. discussion this case involves the interplay between two penal code provisions: the prior felony conviction prison term sentence enhancement provision, section 667.5(b), provision, section 1170.18, for resentencing based on the reclassification of certain felony offenses to misdemeanors by proposition 47. as a threshold matter, the people argue that section 1170.18 does not authorize motions for resentencing that seek to strike section 667.5(b) sentence enhancements resting on felony convictions that were reduced to misdemeanors under proposition 47. therefore, according to the people, the trial court the first place, and the order denying the motion was not appealable. we conclude that, although the trial court had jurisdiction to hear the motion, we do not have jurisdiction to hear the appeal because the motion was nonstatutory (taylor did not file it under section 1170.18, or any statute for that matter) and orders denying nonstatutory motions are nonappealable. (people v. totari (2002) 28 cal.4th 876, 886.) taylor correctly notes, however, that he is claiming that the sentence enhancements at issue here became unlawful immediately following the reduction from felonies to misdemeanors of the convictions on which they rested, and that an unlawful sentence can be corrected at any time. when he filed the notice of appeal from the order denying his resentencing 5 motion, taylor was in custody on the judgment of conviction of which the enhancements were a part. thus, the lawfulness of the enhancements could have been challenged through a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. (people v. villa (2009) 45 cal.4th 1063, purported appeal as an original petition for a writ of habeas corpus and consider the merits of his challenge to the sentence enhancements.

( 1170.18, subds. (f), (g).) section 1170.18 contains two other provisions that are pertinent here. the first of those, section 1170.18, subdivision (k) (section 1170.18(k)), recalled and resentenced under subdivision (b) or designated as a misdemeanor under subdivision (g) shall be considered a misdemeanor for all purposes, except that such resentencing shall not permit that person to own, possess, or have in his or her custody or control any firearm or prevent his or her conviction the second provision, section 1170.18, subdivision (n), provides that, othing in this and related sections is intended to diminish or abrogate the finality of judgments in any case not falling w 7 b. section 1170.18 does not apply retroactively to invalidate section 667.5(b) enhancements imposed in a judgment of conviction that became final prior to proposition 47s enactment taylor argues that, under the on 667.5(b) and section 1170.18(k), a prior prison term enhancement uced to a misdemeanor . . . to support this argument, taylor correctly points out that section section 1170.18(k) provides that a felony conviction reduced to a misdemeanor is con from there, taylor asserts that once a felony conviction has been reduced to a misdemeanor, it no longer can sustain sentence enhancements based on the felony conviction, regardless of when the enhancements were imposed. thus, he claims that the trial reduction to misdemeanors of his felony convictions for possession of a controlled substance and petty theft with a prior retroactively invalidated the enhancements based on those convictions that were part of the 2006 judgment of conviction he suffered for unlawful driving of a vehicle. we do not read the statutes the way that taylor does.2 2 the california supreme court has granted review in several cases in which appellate courts have declined to apply proposition 47 retroactively to invalidate pre-proposition 47 sentence enhancements imposed under section 667.5(b). (see people v. valenzuela (2016) 244 cal.app.4th 692, review granted mar. 30, 2016, s232900 [lead case]; see also people v. jones (2016) 1 cal.app.5th 221, review granted sept. 14, 2016, s235901; people v. williams (2016) 245 cal.app.4th 458, review granted may 11, 2016, s233539; people v. carrea (2016) 244 8 our construction of proposition 47 starts, as it must, with [i]n interpreting a voter initiative . . . , we apply the same principles that govern our construction of a statute. (robert l. v. superior court (2003) 30 cal.4th 894, 900.) hether a statute operates prospectively or retroactively is, at least in the first instance, a matter of legislative intent. when the legislature has not made its intent on the matter clear with respect to a particular statute, the legislatures generally applicable declaration in section 3 provides the default rule: part of [the penal code] is retroactive, unless expressly so . . . [s]ection 3 . . . codif[ies] the time-honored principle . . . that in the absence of an express retroactivity provision, a statute will not be applied retroactively unless it is very clear from extrinsic sources that the legislature . . . must have intended a retroactive application. (people v. brown (2012) 54 cal.4th 314, 319.) this default rule applies equally to a statute enacted through a ballot initiative. (see evangelatos v. superior court the absence of an express retroactivity provision, a statute will not be applied retroactively unless it is very clear from extrinsic sources that the legislature or the voters must have intended a retroactivdefault rule counsels ot to infer retroactive intent from vague phrases and broad, general language in statutes.

[citation.] (brown, supra, at pp. 319-320.) proposition 47 does not contain any language expressly stating that its provisions are retroactive. thus, the default rule against retroactivity generally applies to proposition 47. we say the default rule generally applies here because proposition 47 does contain two mechanisms for resentencing on felony convictions that became final . first, a defendant who was serving a sentence for a felony on the that would now be a misdemeanor may petition for recall of the felony conviction and resentencing as a misdemeanor. ( 1170.18, subds. (a), (b).) second, a defendant who has ca felony that would now be a misdemeanor may apply for redesignation of that conviction as a misdemeanor. ( 1170.18, subds. (f), (g).) these provisions refer only to the reduction of convictions, not enhancements based on those convictions. there is no separate proposition 47 mechanism through which courts can retroactively strike a sentence enhancement that became final , even when the conviction on which the enhancement rests was reduced to a misdemeanor under proposition 47. reading a third mechanism into proposition 47 to allow retroactive challenges to sentence enhancements enactment would contravene section 1170.18, subdivision (n), which states that, [n]othing in this and related sections is intended to diminish or abrogate the finality of judgments in any because sentence 10 resentencing mechanisms, we must heed the directive in section 1170.18, subdivision (n), and avoid a construction of proposition 47 that would diminish or abrogate the finality of an enhancement in a judgment of conviction. taylor falls back on section 1170.language. he contends that therefore the phrase necessarily encompasses sentence enhancements imposed . taylor reads too much into in section 1170.18(k). in abdallah, we observed that the phrase was , subdivision (b) (section 17(b)). (abdallah, supra, 246 cal.app.4th at p. 745.) section 17(b) states that when an offense that is a wobbler is 17(b).) the california supreme court has operate prospectively only. thus, once a wobbler offense has been declared a (people v. feyrer (2010) 48 cal.4th 426, 439; see also people v. park (2013) 56 cal.4th 782, . . . section 17(b) generally precludes its use as a prior felony conviction people v. moomey (2011) 194 cal.app.4th 850, 857 [misdemeanor status of a wobbler . in light of its analogous subject matter (addressing the effect of designating a felony as a misdemeanor), section 1170.18(k) should be interpreted in the same manner as section 17(b).

(abdallah, supra, 246 cal.app.4th at pp. 746-747.) 12 flores, the court held that the defendants current felony sentence for selling heroin could not be enhanced based on a prior felony conviction for marijuana possession because the legislature had reduced the marijuana offense to a misdemeanor before the defendants heroin conviction. (flores, supra, at p. 471.) by contrast, here the sentence enhancement that taylor seeks to strike was imposed in a judgment of conviction that became final nearly a decade before the felony conviction on which the enhancement rested was redesignated as a misdemeanor. firearms exception in section 1170.18(k), which provides that, felony sentence conviction was reduced to a misdemeanor under proposition 47 still will be treated as a felon for purposes of statutory restrictions firearms. according to taylor, if proposition 47 was not intended to apply retroactively to sentence enhancements in judgments of then that limitation would have been recited alongside the firearms exception; its absence from section 1170.18(k), he says, implies that no exception was intended other than the firearms exception. taylor overlooks, however, that section 17(b) carves out several explicit exceptions to its language that the e of one for retroactive application has not dissuaded courts from misdemeanors has prospective effect only. 13 finally, taylor argues that if proposition 47 does not apply retroactively to the sentence enhancements at issue here, then the measure violates the equal protection clause of the united states constitution because it : specifically, a person whose sentence enhancement rests on a conviction that was reduced to a will no longer be subject to the enhancement, whereas a person whose sentence enhancement rests on a conviction that was reduced to a still will be subject to the enhancement. this argument is a nonstarter. the does not forbid statutes and statutory changes to have a beginning, and thus to discriminate between (sperry & hutchinson co. v. rhodes (1911) 220 u.s. 502, 505 [31 s.ct. 490, 55 l.ed. 561]; accord, califano v. webster (1977) 430 u.s. 313, 321 [97 s.ct. 1192, 51 l.ed.2d 360]; people v. floyd (2003) 31 cal.4th 179, 188 [equal protection violation arising from the timing of the effective date of a statute lessening the punishment ].) 14 disposition the petition for writ of habeas corpus is denied. small, j.* we concur: perluss, p. j. segal, j. * judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
