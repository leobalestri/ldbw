(a)(1)1) and possession of a controlled substance (health & saf. code,  11350, subd. (a)). the jury also found true the allegation that defendant suffered two prior convictions under the three strikes law ( 667, subds. (b)-(i); 1170.12, subds. (a)-(d)). the trial court sentenced defendant to concurrent terms of 25 years to life in state prison for his convictions. on june 17, 2013, we affirmed the judgment. on february 8, 2013, defendant filed a proposition 36 petition for recall of sentence as to both of his convictions. on july 8, 2015, defendant also filed a proposition 47 petition for recall of sentence for his possession of a controlled substance conviction. on april 17, 2017, the trial court considered proposition 36 petition as to his felon in possession of a firearm conviction. the court denied the petition, finding, by a preponderance of the evidence, that defendant was statutorily ineligible for resentencing because he was armed with a firearm during the commission of that offense. 1 all further statutory citations are to the penal code unless otherwise noted. 3 proposition 47 petition as to his possession of a controlled substance conviction. the court granted the petition, finding defendant eligible and suitable for relief. accordingly, the court a misdemeanor conviction and sentence. the court dismissed as mocontrolled substance conviction. order denying proposition 36 relief as to his felon in possession of a firearm conviction. subsequent to the courtorder denying defendant proposition 36 relief, the california supreme court held that the preponderance of the evidence36 eligibility determinations. (people v. frierson (2017) 4 cal.5th 225, 239-240 (frierson).) accordingly, we reversed the trial ruling defendant ineligible for resentencing and remanded for a new eligibility hearing under the appropriate legal standard. on october 22, 2018, the trial court held a hearing on beyond a reasonable doubt, that defendant was armed with a firearm when he committed the felon in possession of a firearm offense and thus was statutorily ineligible for resentencing. 4 iii. discussion defendant is ineligible for proposition 36 resentencing defendant contends that insufficient evidence supports the commission of the felon in possession of a firearm offense and thus was ineligible for proposition 36 resentencing. we disagree. a. factual background (people v. stephens (july 25, 2005, b174562, fn. 2)), we set forth the facts underlyin at about 8:00 p.m. on june 23, 1999, long beach police officer james richardson responded to a radio call concerning a landlord-tenant dispute at an apartment complex in the 5900 block of orange avenue. at the complex, officer richardson saw appellant on an upstairs walkway leaning on a railing. the apartment manager was downstairs, yelling at appellant. within radcliffe arrived. appellant to come downstairs. appellant did. officer richardson asked appellant if he had any guns or drugs on his person, and appellant replied that he did not. appellant agreed that officer richardson could conduct a pat-down search for officer safety. during the search, officer richardson felt a hard object that could have been a small pistol, telephone and a couple of hand-rolled cigarettes. 5 contained marijuana, opened one of them, discovered that it contained marijuana and a substance which appeared to be rock cocaine, and arrested appellant. appellant stated that someone needed to lock up his apartment. when officer radcliffe went to the apartment door to lock it, he saw a .25 caliber pistol on a table near the door. the pistol had a round in the chamber and five rounds in the magazine. additional facts pertinent to his claim. b. standard of review determination for substantial evidence. (people v. perez (2018) 4 cal.5th 1055, 1059, 1066 (perez).) we review the whole record in a light most favorable to the [order] to determine whether it contains substantial evidence, i.e., evidence that is credible and of solid value, from which a rational trier of fact could find beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused committed the offense. (in re ryan d. (2002) 100 cal.app.4th 854, 859 . . . ; see people v. barnes (1986) 42 cal.3d 284, 303-304, . . . .)people v. guilford (2014) 228 cal.app.4th 651, 661.) c. analysis indeterminate life sentence may only be imposed where the the offender is not eligible for a determinate sentence based on 6 other disqualifying factors. (pen. code,  667, subd. (e)(2)(c), 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(c).) [it] also enacted section 1170.126, establishing a procedure for an offender serving an indeterminate life sentence for a third strike conviction that is not defined as a serious and/or violent felony to file a petition for recall of sentence. ( 1170.126, subd. (b).) (teal v. superior court (2014) 60 cal.4th 595, 596-597, fn. omitted.) a defendant is disqualified from resentencing under proposition 36 if the defendant was armed with a firearm during the commission of the currentor third strikeoffense. ( 667, subd. (e)(2)(c)(iii); 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(c)(iii).) a trial court may rely on facts not found by the jury in determining whether a defendant is eligible for proposition 36 resentencing. (perez, supra, 4 cal.5th at pp. 1059, 1064.) of a firearm conviction is neither a serious nor a violent felony. ( 667.5, subd. (c); 1192.7, subd. (c).) the trial court found, however, that defendant was armed with a firearm during the commission of that offense and thus was ineligible for proposition 36 resentencing. defendant in people v. osuna (2014) 225 cal.app.4th 1020 (osuna) (disapproved of on another ground by frierson, supra, 4 cal.5th at page 240, footnote 8), the court of appeal considered the armed with a firearmdefendant who had been convicted of being a felon in possession armed with a firearma firearm available for offensive or defensive use.(id. at p. 1029.) the court explained that possessing a firearm does not necessarily constitute being armed with a firearm.(osuna, supra, 4 cal.5th at p. 1030, fn. omitted.) p 7 felon in possession of a firearm offense can be actual or constructive. (id. at p. 1029.) actualconstructivewhile not in his actual possession, is nonetheless under his dominion and control, either directly or through others. [citations.]ibid.) a defendant guilty of being a felon in possession of a firearm through constructive possession may not be armed with a firearmovisions of proposition 36 resentencing. (ibid.) according to the testimony at trial, when police officers complex, defendant was standing on the second level walkway leaning on a railing right in front of his apartment door. upon being arrested, defendant somebody needs to lock up my apartment. officer radcliffe the apartment to close the door. as he was closing the door, he saw the loaded handgun defendant was convicted of possessing on a table just inside the doorjamb. asked how far inside the door the handgun was, officer dgun was -hand side of the reach in and grab it.2 2 officer radcliffe was not sure whether there was a screen door in addition to the front door but even if there was a screen throughwhe 8 viewing the record in the light most favorable to the order, we conclude there was sufficient evidence that defendant had the offensive or defensive use. the trial court thus did not err in commission of the felon in possession of a firearm offense.
