(evid. code,  452, subd. (d), rested on the evidence presented at the preliminary hearing in the new case. therefore, the transcript of that preliminary hearing is already a part of the present record. the remainder of the record in the new case, however, has no relevance to our review of the present probation revocation order. accordingly, we decline to judicially notice that record.
