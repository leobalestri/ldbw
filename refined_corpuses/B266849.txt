(oscar) and his daughter arrived home in his truck one evening at approximately 11:00 p.m. with a birthday cake for one of his adult sons, christian. his other two sons, oscar de la cruz, jr. (oscar jr.) and ismael, and a family friend, peter romero, were inside the house for the birthday gathering. oscar told his daughter to take the cake inside while he parked his truck. as oscar was standing in his driveway, he saw two hispanic men wearing dark clothing walking toward him on the he also saw them trying to hide when a police officer on a motorcycle passed by. oscar asked the two men what they wanted. they did not answer, but kept staring at him. one of them, whom oscar 3 identified at trial (but not at the preliminary hearing) as diaz,1 took a gun from his waistband area and shot oscar in the abdomen as oscar tried to jump out of the way. six times. then the second man, whom oscar identified at trial (but again not at the preliminary hearing) as torres, removed a gun from his waistband area and shot oscar once in the upper left arm. oscar fell to his knees, and the two men ran down the street. oscar, who began to feel dizzy and was losing his hearing, saw romero come out of the house, followed by christian and ismael, and chase the two men. oscar was taken to the hospital. while he was in the hospital, he met with detective craig hewitt the day after the shooting and identified diaz and torres in six-pack photographic lineups. detective hewitt oscar also testified he was awake during the identification. oscar was in the hospital for a month. he had numerous bullet scars, which he showed to the jury. b. pursuit romero and oscar jr., who were inside the house during the attack, heard gunshots and ran outside. they saw ismael and christian, who were already outside, hiding behind a car in the driveway and screaming dad. oscar told romero he was hurt and to call an ambulance. 1 oscar stated he did not want to testify at trial because he was afraid, and only came to court because he was ordered by the court to appear. oscar said he did not identify diaz and torres at the preliminary hearing because he was afraid for his children and his family. 4 romero saw two men, whom romero identified at trial as diaz and torres, standing five feet from oscar and hiding something in their pockets.2 when the two men ran away, romero, christian, and ismael chased them. oscar jr. stayed with his father, found a blanket, and covered him with it.3 as romero, christian, and ismael pursued the two assailants, torres fell, and romero caught up with him. torres still had the gun in his hand after he fell and was trying to put it away in his pocket. then torres pointed the gun at romero, and romero heard clicks. iromero, ismael, and christian then beat up torres until he was unconscious and bleeding. the gun ended up on the ground. ismael and christian went back to check on oscar, while romero stayed with torres until a police officer arrived. when the police arrived, romero showed them the gun on the ground. c. investigation officer michael ornelas arrived at the scene and found two motor officers standing next to torres, who was unconscious and bleeding from his head, and romero, who was handcuffed. 2 romero admitted that at the preliminary hearing he testified he did not recall what had happened that night. he get beat up, stabbed, or killed) but he was not afraid. romero stated friends had discouraged him from testifying, but he 3 oscar jr. testified he did not want to be at the trial, but appeared because he had been taken into custody the last time he had refused to come to court. 5 officer ornelas then went to the de la cruz home and observed fire department paramedics treating oscar. officer ornelas recovered .38 and .45 caliber casings and fragments wallet on the ground in front of the house. officers also recovered near torres a .38 caliber gun with a broken handle and a bullet in the cylinder. meanwhile, officer allan flores responded to an intersection near the de la cruz home and observed diaz sitting on a bus stop bench with another police officer. diaz was grabbing his leg and appeared to be in pain. officer flores also saw and recovered a .45 caliber semiautomatic handgun with an empty magazine approximately 25 feet from diaz. the slide was in the forward position, as though it were ready to fire. criminologists with the los angeles police department determined all of the .38 caliber casings were discharged from the same firearm and all of the .45 caliber casings were discharged from the same firearm. d. charges the people charged torres and diaz with attempted willful, deliberated, and premeditated murder (pen. code.,  187, subd. (a), 664)4 and carrying a loaded firearm while an active participant in a criminal street gang ( 25850, subds. (a), (c)(3)). the people also charged torres with possession of a firearm by a felon ( 29800, subd. (a)(1)) and possession of ammunition ( 30305, subd. (a)(1)). the people alleged torres and diaz committed all of the crimes for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with a criminal street gang with the specific intent to promote, further, and assist in criminal conduct 4 statutory references are to the penal code 6 by the gang, within the meaning of section 186.22, subdivisions (b)(1)(a) and (b)(1)(c). in connection with the attempted murder count, the people alleged torres and diaz personally used a firearm, personally and intentionally discharged a firearm, and personally and intentionally discharged a firearm causing great bodily injury or death, within the meaning of section 12022.53, subdivisions (b), (c), and (d), and they were principals in an offense committed with the use or discharge of a firearm and violated section 186.22, within the meaning of section 12022.53, subdivision (e). finally, the people alleged torres served three prior prison terms for felonies within the meaning of section 667.5, subdivision (b). the people also alleged the attempted murder charge was punishable in state prison for life with a minimum parole of 15 calendar years, pursuant to section 186.22, subdivision (b)(5). e. gang evidence torres and diaz admitted to several police officers who testified at trial that they are members of a criminal street gang, torres of the pacoima brownstone locos with a moniker of malo and diaz of the paxton street locos with a moniker of cartoon. there was also evidence oscar jr. and christian are members of the clanton 14 criminal street gang. officer ethan livesey, who worked over 10 years in gang enforcement, testified for the people as an expert on criminal street gangs. he stated the brownstone and paxton street locos but they are so closely tied together, they are sometimes almost the two gangs will identify himself as a member of the other 7 gang, and members of the two gangs will commit crimes together. livesey also stated clanton 14 is a rival of the brownstone and paxton street locos, and the two sides were in a turf battle in pacoima because clanton 14 was starting to move into the territory of the brownstone locos. in response to a hypothetical question mirroring the facts of this case, officer livesey opined that the two individuals committed the crime for the benefit of and in association with the brownstone and committing an act of violence against a rival gang. basically, they are carrying out a mission to attack a rival gang member to . . . show that they still have power, that they are willing to committed in association because you have two members from the same gang who are working together in association to commit he also testified an attack by members of the brownstone or paxton street locos on a member of the clanton 14 gang benefits the brownstone and paxton street locos because news of the attack will spread in the community and boost the status of attacking gangs. f. conviction the jury convicted torres and diaz on all counts, found they committed the attempted murder willfully, with deliberation, and with premeditation, and found true the gang allegation under section 186.22, subdivision (b)(1)(c) as to the attempted murder counts, the gang allegation under section 186.22, subdivision (b)(1)(a) as to the remaining counts, and all of the firearm allegations. the trial court sentenced both defendants on count one to life imprisonment with the possibility 8 of parole, with a minimum parole eligibility term of 15 years, pursuant to section 186.22, subdivision (b)(5). in addition, the court imposed a sentence of 25 years to life for the firearm use enhancement under section 12022.53, subdivision (d). the court also imposed but stayed execution of sentences on the remaining counts and enhancements under section 654, and dismissed the prior prison term allegations as to torres. discussion a. the trial court did not violate by prohibiting read-back because the court did not prohibit any read-back during deliberations the jury sent the court a note asking [and] oscar de the following response: a transcript is not possible my court reporter informs that the full testimony of both witnesses will take two hours to prepare and then 3 1/2 hours to read back. is it possible to narrow your request to particular reaching and returning its verdicts. diaz argues the court violated his statutory rights under section 11385 and his constitutional rights to a unanimous jury, a 5 section 1138 provides: deliberation, if there be any disagreement between them as to the 9 -back of testimony requested by the jury and refusing the problerequest, and the trial court did not refuse to have the court reporter read back, any testimony. the jury asked for transcripts. they trial court denied the request for transcripts, and diaz does not contend the trial court erred by denying that request. although the jury did not ask for read-back of any testimony, the trial court raised that possibility for the jurors to consider. indeed, rather than prohibiting read-back, the trial court, after denying the request for transcripts, took the additional step of trying to assist the jurors by reminding them, as the court had previously instructed them, they could request read-back of testimony if they wanted it. they did not. diaz unfairly characterizes the agreed-upon answer choicealthough transcripts were not possible, read-back was, and asked the jurors whether, if they wanted read-back, it was possible for them to narrow the read-back of testimony to what they wanted to hear. this kind of response to a request for read-back occurs testimony, or if they desire to be informed on any point of law arising in the case, they must require the officer to conduct them into court. upon being brought into court, the information required must be given in the presence of, or after notice to, the prosecuting attorney, and the defendant or his counsel, or after 10 in criminal and civil courtrooms throughout the state, and the the cases cited by diaz are all distinguishable because, unlike this case, they involved refusals to allow court reporters to read back testimony to the jurors. for example, in people v. butler request during deliberations for read-back of five witnesses who had testified at trial, commenting, forever(id. at pp. 276, 278, 279.) in holding the refusal to allow read-back was reversible error, the court in butler faulted the trial court in that case for not doing no attempt was made by the court to attempt a narrowing down to portions of the testimos request [citation] . . . (id. at p. 281.) in people v. litteral (1978) 79 cal.app.3d 790 the trial court refused a request for read-back of testimony because the court reporter was ill, telling the jurorswe can do it.id. at p. 793.) the court in litteral emphasized that, as in butlerexplaining possiid. at p. 795.) and people v. henderson (1935) 4 cal.2d 188 involved a very different situation. in that case the supreme court reversed a conviction because the jury asked for read-back of the testimony of a witness regarding a specific subject matter, and the court reporter selected some but id. at pp. 193-194.) people v. anjell (1979) 100 cal.app.3d 189, disapproved on another ground in people v. mason (1991) 52 cal.3d 909, 942-943, also cited by torres, 11 court in anjell held it was not to inform the jurors of the time involved in rereading the requested testimony, so that they could make a knowledgeable decision as to whether they desired to hear itanjell, at pp. 202-203; see people v. gurule (2002) 28 cal.4th 557, 649-650 [trial court did not abuse its discretion or coerce the jury by advising a juror the estimated time for reading back the requested testimony was three hours and by asking, was there a particular part of any testimony that you were seeking be reread?people v. warren (1900) 130 cal. 678, 681--back by informing the jury reading the 300 pages of testimony would take two hours, and the jury reached a verdict before the testimony could be read].) it is true, as diaz points out, the trial court in anjell made additional statements indicating the jurors were entitled to read-back of testimony if they wanted it: so you can see that if you add up those three you have got an awful lot of hours of testimony. now that is not to say that you cans what you need in your deliberations. . . . and what i am going to ask you to do is retire to the jury room and have a discussion as to what you need and then you write me another note and let me know and whatever it is that the jury decides they . (anjell, supra, 100 cal.app.3d at p. 202, fn. 4.) the trial court here instructed the jury before deliberations that the court reporter was making a record of the trial proceedings, and the jury had the ability to ask the court reporter to read the record if the jurors decided it was necessary. perhaps the trial court could have included a reinforcement of its prior instruction and reminded the jurors in its response to their question they could 12 have read-back of any testimony they wanted. but the trial court did not abuse its discretion in failing to instruct the jury on this point again, particularly when, as noted, the jurorsdid not even ask for read-back. (see people v. williams (2015) 61 cal.4th 1244, the original instructions are themselves full and complete, the court has discretion under . . . section 1138 to determine what additional explanations are sufficient to satisfy the s request for informationpeople v. hodges (2013) 213 cal.app.4th 531, 539 e review for an abuse of discretion any error under section 1138 b. the court did not err in refusing to give an instruction on self-defense because there was no substantial evidence to support the defense at trial, diaz and torres asked the court to give jury instructions on self-defense, suggesting they were defending themselves from an attack by the de la cruz brothers, who were members of a rival gang. counsel argued there was sufficient evidence to give such instructions because a percipient witness, sergio cabrera, testified he saw one of the two individuals who in a shooting manner the court should instruct on self-members would potentially arm themselves up,oscar admitted he had lied about what happened. the trial court not even close. there is no substantial evidence of self-defense, so i am not going to give self-defense i at a subsequent discussion about the jury instructions, counsel for diaz and torres renewed their requests for self-defense instructions, including attempted 13 voluntary manslaughter based on imperfect self-defense. the trial court again denithere is sufficient evidence of self-defense, imperfect or otherwise, heat of passion, any kind of basis for attempted voluntary torres argues the trial court violated his constitutional rights by refusing to instruct the jury on perfect and imperfect self-the number of fingerprints on the .38 caliber revolver, and the fact the de la cruz brothers were a gang confrontation occurred between the de la cruz family and [diaz and torres] and therefore [torres] could have been acting in self-defense. the doctrine of self-defense embraces two types: perfect and imperfect. (people v. iraheta (2014) 227 cal.app.4th 611, 620.) -defense requires that a defendant have an honest and reasonable belief in the need to defend himself or (people v. rodarte (2014) 223 cal.app.4th 1158, 1168; accord, people v. valenzuela (2011) 199 cal.app.4th 1214, 1227.) perfect self-defense exonerates the defendant completely. (people v. humphrey (1996) 13 cal.4th 1073, 1082; people v. sotelo-urena (2016) 4 cal.app.5th 732, 744.) -defense, which reduces murder to voluntary manslaughter, arises when a defendant acts in the actual but unreasonable belief that he is in imminent danger of death or great bodily injury. (people v. duff (2014) 58 cal.4th 527, 561-562; accord, iraheta, supra, 227 cal.app.4th at p. 620; see people v. simon (2016) 1 cal.5th 98, 132 mperfect self-defense differs from complete self-defense, which requires not only an honest but 14 also a reasonable belief- (people v. elmore (2014) 59 cal.4th 121, 134.) neither perfect nor imperfect self-be invoked by a defendant who, through his own wrongful conduct (e.g., the initiation of a physical attack or the commission of a felony), has created circumsts attack or pursuit is legally justified.people v. enraca (2012) 53 cal.4th 735, 761; see people v. trujeque (2015) 61 cal.4th 227, 271.) the trial court need only instruct on self-defense if there is substantial evidence to support the defense. (see simon, supra, 1 cal.5th at p. 132; people v. nguyen (2015) 61 cal.4th 1015, 1048; people v. stitely (2005) 35 cal.4th 514, 551.) substantial eviddeserve consideration by the jury, that is, evidence that a reasonable jury could find persuasive.people v. barton (1995) 12 cal.4th 186, 201, fn. 8; see people v. wilson (2005) 36 cal.4th 309, 331 evidence suto deserve consideration by the whenever any evidence is presented, no matter how weak].) there was no evidence torres or diaz had an honest and reasonable belief he needed to defend himself or acted in an actual or unreasonable belief he was in imminent danger of death or great bodily injury. there was no substantial evidence any of the de la cruz brothers were present when torres and diaz shot oscar, let alone were present with guns and shot at torres and diaz. cabrera, on whose testimony torres and diaz rely, stated only that after he heard shots fired, he saw two individuals running down the street chasing another individual, and one of 15 the individuals in pursuit if he [was] cabrera testified, however, he could not see whether either of the two people running had a gun in his hand. the gun the police found near him, there was no evidence of fingerprints on the gun. and the fact that some of the de la cruz brothers may have been gang members, or that or more gangs,is not substantial evidence that anyone actually attacked torres and diaz and caused them to fear, reasonably or unreasonably, they were in danger. (see people v. young (2005) 34 cal.4th 1149, 1200 he trial court need not give instructions based solely on conjecture and speculation; people v. waidla (2000) 22 cal.4th 690, 735 peculation is not evidence, less still substantial evidence) the trial court properly denied the requests for jury instructions on self-defense. c. the trial court did not err in adsix-pack photographic lineup identification because it was not suggestive, let alone unduly suggestive torres argues the trial court violated his federal and state -pack identification identification . . . was not reliable and was subject to a strong condition when detective hewitt showed him the six-pack photographic lineups. according to torres, at the time of the 16 and able to clearly make an analysis of the six-pack without feeling pressure to make a selection while in a compromised in s right to due process is violated by the admission of identification evidence, we (1) whether the identification procedure was unduly suggestive and unnecessary, and, if so, (2) whether the identification itself was nevertheless reliable under the totality of people v. clark (2016) 63 cal.4th 522, 556; see people v. avila (2009) 46 cal.4th 680, 698 ue process requires the exclusion of identification testimony only if the identification procedures used were unnecessarily suggestive and, if so, the resulting identification was also unreliable].) if, and only if, the answer to the first question is yes and the answer to the second is no, is the identification constitutionally unreliable. (people v. ochoa (1998) 19 cal.4th 353, 412.) where the identification procedures are not unduly suggestive, the court need not address the issue whether the identification is reliable. (people v. cook (2007) 40 cal.4th 1334, 1355; see people v. alexander (2010) 49 cal.4th 846, 902 ly if the challenged identification procedure is unnecessarily suggestive is it necessary to determine the reliability of the resulting identification]; people v. desantis (1992) 2 cal.4th 1198, 1224, fn. 8 ur holding that the lineups were not suggestive makes it unnecessary to decide whether the in-court identification was reliable despite the suggestiveness as torres acknowledges, he does not argue it was suggestive, unduly or otherwise. torres 17 does not argue there was anything about the photographs detective hewitt showed oscar in the hospital that caused either to stand out from the others in a way that would suggest the witness should select him. (avila, supra, 46 cal.4th at p. 698; see, e.g., people v. carter (2005) 36 cal.4th 1114, 1162 [defendant claimed photographic lineup was unduly suggestive he was the only person whose photograph depicted an individual wearing an jail jumpsuitpeople v. carlos (2006) 138 cal.app.4th 907, 912 [six-pack photographic lineup was unduly suggestive because the below his photograph]; people v. west (1984) 154 cal.app.3d 100, 105 [defendant claimed his nor does torres argue detective hewitt made any statements or movements suggesting which photograph oscar should select. (see, e.g., people v. yeoman (2003) 31 cal.4th 93, 124 [photographic lineup was not unduly suggestive where the police [the witness] should people v. pijal (1973) 33 cal.app.3d 682, 689 [suggestive comments by the police to the witness is an indication the identification was unduly suggestive].) to the contrary, torres concedes -suggestive six-pack comp and prove the photographic identification was unduly suggestive dooms his constitutional challenge to its admissibility. (see ochoa, supra, 19 cal.4th at p. 413 for a witness identification procedure to violate the due process clauses, the state must, at the threshold, improperly suggest something to the witnessi.e., 18 it must, wittingly or unwittingly, initiate an unduly suggestive procedure.)6 d. the trial court did not err in sentencing torres and diaz under section 186.22, subdivision (b)(5) ection 186.22, subdivision (b)(5) . . . provides that a a felony punishable by imprisonment in the state prison for life for the benefit of a criminal street gang shall not be paroled until a minimum of 15 calendar years have been served.

(see yeoman, supra, 31 cal.4th at pp. 123-124.) 19 parole; people v. gonzalez if either the defendant or an accomplice formed the intent to kill with premeditation and deliberation, punishment for the attempted murder is increased to life imprisonment with possibility of parole) as noted, the jury found true the gang allegation under section 186.22, subdivision (b)(1)(c), as to the attempted murder count. the trial court did not impose the 10-year enhancement under that provision, but instead imposed the alternative sentence under section 186.22, subdivision (b)(5), of life imprisonment with a minimum parole period of 15 years. torres argues that, because the jury returned true findings on the gang enhancement under section 186.22, subdivision (b)(1)(c), and not under section 186.22, subdivision (b)(5), the court should have imposed the 10-year enhancement under the former provision and not sentenced torres under the latter provision. torres argues the people must plead and prove all ecific gang enhancements were -year enhancement under 186.22, subdivision (b)(1)(c). torres asks for years. it is true, as torres argues, that under section 1170.1, ll enhancements shall be alleged in the accusatory pleading and either admitted by the defendant in open court or found to be true by the trier of fact186.22, subdivision (b)(5), however, is not an enhancement. it is alternate people v. jefferson (1999) 21 cal.4th 86, 101; see people v. briceno (2004) 20 an alternate penalty provision that applies to any gang-related people v. campos (2011) 196 cal.app.4th 438, 451 additional term of years to be added to a base term and is , disapproved on another ground in people v. fuentes (2016) 1 cal.5 218, 281, fn. 8.)7 indeed, as the people point out, because section 186.22, subdivision (b)(5) applies, the trial court would have committed error by imposing the 10-year gang enhancement under section 186.22, subdivision (b)(1)(c).
