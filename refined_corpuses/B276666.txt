filed 2/8/18 p. v. davis ca2/2 not to be published in the official reports california rules of court, rule 8.1115(a), prohibits courts and parties from citing or relying on opinions not certified for publication or ordered published, except as specified by rule 8.1115(b). this opinion has not been certified for publication or ordered published for purposes of rule 8.1115. in the court of appeal of the state of california second appellate district division two the people, plaintiff and respondent, v. jermond c. davis, defendant and appellant. b276666 (los angeles county super. ct. no. ba429334) appeal from a judgment of the superior court of los angeles county. craig j. mitchell, judge. affirmed. james m. crawford, under appointment by the court of appeal, for defendant and appellant. xavier becerra, attorney general, gerald a. engler, chief assistant attorney general, lance e. winters, senior assistant attorney general, kim aarons and amanda v. lopez deputy attorneys general, for plaintiff and respondent. * * * * * * 2 the trial court imposed a five-year sentencing enhancement on jermond c. davis (defendant) because his prior robbery conviction constituted a serious felony conviction under penal code section 667, subdivision (a)(1).1 defendant argues that this was error because he only admitted that his robbery e meaning of our three strikes law ( 667, subds. (b)-(j) & 1170.12, subds. (a)-(d)), and because the trial court never told him that, in so admitting, he was also admitting that his prior robbery conviction was a prior serious felony that could subject him to the additional five-year term. we conclude that defendant forfeited this objection by not objecting when the trial court later imposed the five-year enhancement, that and that he was not in any event prejudiced by the facts and procedural background i. facts in late august 2014, defendant fired at least two shots at henry dorsey (dorsey) as dorsey was driving, and the bullets struck dorsey in the abdomen and the buttocks. ii. procedural background the people charged defendant with: (1) attempted willful, deliberate, and premeditated murder ( 187, subd. (a) & 664); (2) shooting at an occupied vehicle ( 246); (3) discharging a firearm with gross negligence ( 246.3, subd. (a)); (4) being a felon in possession of a firearm ( 29800, subd. (a)(1)); (5) carrying a loaded, unregistered firearm ( 25850, subd. (a)); and (6) assault 1 all further statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise indicated. 3 with a semiautomatic firearm ( 245, subd. (b)). the people also bery ( 211) constituted a strike within the meaning of our three strikes law as well as a prior serious felony conviction under section 667, subdivision (a)(1) as to the attempted murder, shooting at an occupied vehicle, discharging a firearm, and assault counts.2 the people further alleged that the strike [e] defendant waived his right to counsel and proceeded pro se. at a pretrial conference weeks before trial, the prosecutor gave defendant a copy of the charging document and told the court that he had explained to defendant that the allegations in ble[ sentence. at a further pretrial conference days before trial, the court asked defendant whether he wanted to bifurcate the issue of his prior felony conviction (underlying the felon-in-possession count as well as the sentencing enhancements) or whether he wanted to admit that prior conviction. defendant replied that he the court then accepted this 2 the people also alleged that all of the counts except the direction of, and in association ( 186.22, subd. (b)(1)); that defendant personally used a firearm ( 12022.5) in committing the attempted murder, shooting at an occupied vehicle, conviction constituted a prior prison term ( 667.5, subd. (b)). 4 waiver of the right to have the jury determine the prior conviction. the matter proceeded to trial. the jury found defendant guilty of discharging a firearm with gross negligence, being a felon in possession, and possessing a loaded, unregistered firearm; the jury acquitted him of the remaining counts. the jury found the gang allegation not true. immediately after the jury was discharged, the court asked bench trial on the issue. strikrights he would be giving up if he waived his right to a bench trialspecifically, the right to require proof beyond a reasonable doubt, the right to confront witnesses and evidence, the right to compulsory process, and the privilege against incrimination. defendant then indicated that he understood those rights and gives up and admit[s], pursuant to what is alleged in the [charging document], that [he] ha[s] suffered, within the meaning of penal code section 667(d) and 1170.12, . . . a prior strike robbery. the trial court ultimately sentenced defendant to a prison term of 11 years. the court imposed an 11-year sentence on the discharging a firearm count, calculated as a base term of three years (doubled due to the prior strike), plus an additional five years for the prior serious felony. the court did not impose the one-year enhancement for a prior prison term. the court also imposed a concurrent six-year term on the felon-in-possession count, and imposed but stayed under section 654 a four-year term on the possession of an unregistered firearm count. 5 sole objection to his sentence was that the discharging a firearm count was not itself a serious felony (and thus could not support the five-year enhancement that required both the prior and current felonies to be serious felonies). defendant did not object that the court was wrong to treat his prior admission that the robbery conviction was a strike as an admission that it was also a prior serious felony. defendant filed this timely appeal. discussion a defendanof a guilty plea to a substantive offense, is valid under the federal constitution only if it in re yurko (1974) 10 cal.3d 857, 863 (yurko); people v. mosby (2004) 33 cal.4th 353, 359 (mosby), citing boykin v. alabama (1969) 395 u.s. 238 & in re tahl (1969) 1 cal.3d 122.) an admission or plea informed of, and specifically gives up compulsory self-,(3) people v. cross (2015) 61 cal.4th 164, 170 (cross).) in california, an admission to a prior conviction is valid only if the deffull penal effect of a finding of the truth of an allegation of cross, at p. 170; yurko, at p. 865.) in this case, defendant was not explicitly advised by the for an additional, consecutive five-year prison term if his current consequently 6 al for three reasons. first, defendant has forfeited this argument. although the requirement that a court advise a defendant of the constitutional rights he is waiving is of constitutional dimension, the cross, supra, 61 cal.4th at pp. 170-171; yurko, supra, 10 cal.3d at p. 865.) as such, it is subject to people v. wrice (1995) 38 cal.app.4th 767, 770-771; people v. walker (1991) 54 cal.3d 1013, 1022-1023, overruled in part on other grounds by people v. villalobos (2012) 54 cal.4th 177, 183.) in this case, although defendant objected that his current offense was not a serious felony (thereby rendering s-year enhancement inapplicable), he never objected that the court was wrong to apply that enhancement in the first place because his admission did not encompass that enhancement. what is more, the absence of any objection cannot be blamed on ineffective assistance of counsel because defendant represented himself. (people v. espinoza (2016) 1 cal.5th 61, 75 -represented remise a claim of ineffective assistance of second, defendant that his stipulation to the prior strike also exposed him to an additional five-year sentence did not render that stipulation invalid. in assessing whether a deknowing and voluntary, courts look not only to the colloquy at which the plea or admission is taken, but to the record as a whole, and ask: daffirmatively show [the admission to be] 7 voluntary and intelligent under the totality of the circumstances?mosby, supra, 33 cal.4th at p. 360.) in this case, the prosecutor gave defendant a copy of the charging prior robbery conviction would not only double his sentence but would also add a consecutive five-year sentence. at that very same hearing, the prosecutor reiterated what the charging document saidnamely, that defend[] lastly, defendant cannot show that he was prejudiced by the lack of advisement. in this context, prejudice means that people v. mcclellan (1993) 6 cal.4th 367, 378.) there is nothing in the record indicating that defendant would have opted not to admit that his robbery conviction was a prior strike if he knew that admission also rendered him eligible for a five-year enhancement under section 667, subdivision (a)(1). to the contrary, defendant told the court or prior convictionwithout any reservations about doing so. 8 disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. ______________________, j. hoffstadt we concur: _________________________, p. j. lui _________________________, j. chavez
