(see people v. karis (1988) 46 cal.3d 612, 656.) [] [moreover, thomas was] responsible for service on all contentions after examination of the record, appointed appellate counsel filed an opening brief which raised no issues and requested this court to conduct an independent review of the record. by notice filed january 3, 2013, the clerk of this court advised thomas to submit within 30 days any contentions, grounds of appeal or arguments he wished this court to consider. on january 16, 2013, thomas filed a request for an extension of time, to april 15, 2013, to file a supplemental brief. this court granted the request. on march 4, 2013, this court granted thomas a second extension, allowing him to file his supplemental brief up to and including may 15, 2013. on march 11, 2013, thomas filed a letter brief in which he asserted his appellate counsel had been ineffective for failing to obtain for him portions of the record, as well as judge. the contention is without two orders previously issued by this court. in an order filed june 27, 2012, this court 6 appeal in the above matter, [the court] hereby denies said request. thomas was represented on appeal by appointed counsel who filed an opening brief which raised no issues and asked this court to conduct an independent review of the record. (see people v. wende (1979) 25 cal.3d 436.) we directed appointed appellate counsel to forward the record on appeal to thomas who thereafter filed a supplemental letter brief in which he raised numerous issues which we rejected. (people v. thomas (april 27, 2004, b161765) [nonpub. opn.].) because it thus appears thomas already has been provided a copy of the record on appeal, and he has failed to state grounds that would warrant providing him a appeal sim in a second order, issued by this court on july 30, 2012 and provided as an exhibit for a copy of the record on appeal and to reinstate the appeal in the above matter, [the court] hereby denies said requests. thomas asserts prison officials lost his copy of the record on appeal when he was transferred from one prison to another. he claims he needs another copy of the record to show the prosecutor violated his substantive rights by charging six counts of making a criminal threat in violation of . . . section 422, based on a single threatening letter. however, the unpublished opinion filed january 28, 1991, indicates thomas wrote two threatening letters and each letter threatened a judge, a unpublished opinion.[4] thus, thomas has failed to demonstrate good cause to provide him a second copy of the record on appeal 4 the unpublished opinion in people v. thomas, case no. b161765, filed april 27, rolling nineties street gang members were accused of shooting a child who was killed in gang cross fire. the defendants pled guilty and were sentenced to prison. on august 21, 2000, judge brandlin received a letter threatening his life, the life of the prosecutor that handled the cross fire case, valerie cole, and the investigating officer in the case, mark campbell. thfrom the rolling nineties street gang. the letter threatened that if the gang member 7 here, as in his previous petitions, thomas has failed to show good cause demonstrating it is necessary that he be provided with another copy of the record and ya045335. accordingly, it cannot be concluded his appellate counsel was incompetent for failing to attempt to procure these records for him. (see strickland v. washington (1984) 466 u.s. 668, 669, 693-694; people v .carter (2003) 30 cal.4th 1166, 1211; see also in re spears (1984) 157 cal.app.3d 1203, 1210-1211.) thomas filed a second supplemental brief on april 25, 2013. in this brief, he asserted that, with regard to his 1989 case no. a741808 in which he pled no contest to one count of former section 12025, subdivision (b), being a convicted felon in possession of a concealed firearm, the trial court failed to give him the opportunity to show he was is brief thomas indicates he found a gun under a bus stop bench, picked it up and placed it in his pocket. although he claims he intended to take the gun to a police station where he could turn it in, when he was later stopped and searched by police officers, he was found to be in possession of the weapon. moreover, rather than go to trial on the matter, at proceedings held on june 7, 1989 thomas chose to admit he was a convicted felon in possession of a concealed firearm by entering a plea of no contest to the offense. with regard to his assertion his trial counsel was ineffective, thomas claims his public defender failed to properly investigate the matter and to obtain pertinent records from the district attorney. in particular, thomas indicates his counsel failed to obtain records regarding his history of mental illness. although thomas has attached as exhibits to his brief some documents which appear to pertain to his mental health, it is unclear as on june 7, 1989, the day he entered his plea. the only document which indicates thomas needed to be involuntarily defendants in the cross fire case were not returned to court by october 31, 2000, judge brandlin, the prosecut 8 filed by the california department of corrections dated august 2, 1995, several years after thomas entered his plea in case no. a741808. finally, thomas asserts the district attorney withheld information from his counsel. thomas indicates the district attorney failed to inform his counsel that, before thomas was detained and arrested by police officers, the officers had received a 911 call fficers -down apart from whether the distcounsel, thomas has failed to show it caused him prejudice. if anything, the evidence would have been inculpatory. case [no.] ba036950 to [the] los angeles superior court . . application, thomas again asserted because the district attorney had withheld information, he was entitled to withdraw his plea and proceed to trial on the matter. he asked this court to remand both case no. ba036950 and case no. ba047233 to the los angeles superior court and to direct the court to allow him to withdraw his pleas and go to trial. he argued he is innocent of the charges and should be allowed to proceed by having a jury trial in both matters. thomas, however, pled guilty in both cases in 1992. he then failed to seek review; he did not file notices of appeal and requests for certificates of probable cause. moreover, in the present supplemental brief, he does not indicate he has discovered new, exculpatory evidence. his statement, without corroboration by independent, objective evidence is insufficient to warrant relief. (in re alvernaz (1992) 2 cal.4th 924, 938, 945.) in the additional supplemental brief filed on april 25, 2013, thomas argued his 2002 conviction in case no. ya045335 was unlawful. however, as stated above, the 9 judgment which was entered following a court trial was affirmed on appeal by this court in people v. thomas, supra, b161765. according to thomas, the california supreme court then denied review and his petition for a writ of habeas corpus was denied by the united states district court (central). in this additional brief, thomas argues only one new point: that his delay in bringing this claim is justified. he asserts he failed to bring and was unable to understand how to make use of the exhibits provided to him. ia persona is held to the same standard of people v. clark (1990) 50 cal.3d 583, 625; see also faretta v. california (1975) 422 u.s. 806, 834-835, fn. 46.) thomas had been provided a copy of the record on appeal and the relevant facts are contained in years before he filed the petition for writ of error coram nobis in the trial court. finally, as the trial court indicate review on appeal we have examined the entire record and are satisfied counsel has complied fully smith v. robbins (2000) 528 u.s. 259, 278-284; people v. wende (1979) 25 cal.3d 436, 443.) 10 disposition affirmed. not to be published in the official reports klein, p. j. we concur: croskey, j. kitching, j.
