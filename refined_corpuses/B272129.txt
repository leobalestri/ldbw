(a)), unlawfully taking a vehicle (veh. code,  10851, subd. (a)), and receiving stolen property (pen. code,  496, subd. (a)).1 defendant was also found to have served a prior prison term ( 667.5, subd. (b)), and suffered two prior convictions as defined in the three strikes law ( 667, subds. (b)(i), 1170.12 subds. (a)(d)). he was sentenced to an indeterminate term of 26 years to life.2 1 all future statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise specified. 2 the trial court sentenced defendant to 25 years to life convictions, but concluded that the trial court was required to impose or strike the section 667.5, subdivision (b) enhancement. at resentencing, the court imposed the life. 3 petition under section 1170.126 to recall his indeterminate sentence and to be resentenced as a second strike offender. the trial court denied the petition, finding that defendant posed an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. defendant contends the trial court failed to apply the correct standard when making its dangerousness determination. he argues that the definition of unreasonable risk of danger to public safety contained in section 1170.18, which was added by initiative measure in 2014, applies to resentencing petitions under the act, such as his, which were pending at the time the initiative became effective. he contends the trial court erred in failing to consider his petition under this definition, and requests that we reverse and remand the matter for a determination of dangerousness as defined in proposition 47. we affirm the order denying the petition. 4 discussion3 in november 2012, california voters passed proposition 36, which modified the three strikes law to permit sentences of 25 years to life in most cases only when the third or subsequent felony conviction is for a serious or violent felony. the proposition allows defendants previously sentenced to 25 years to life for a nonserious, nonviolent third felony conviction to petition for recall of their sentences. an eligible defendant is entitled to resentencing unless the court, in its discretion, determines that resentencing the [defendant] would pose an unreasonable 1170.126, subd. (f).) proposition 36 does not define rt, in exercising its discretion, may consider conviction history, including the type of crimes committed, the extent of injury to victims, the length of prior prison 3 defendant does not challenge the sufficiency of the determination. absent such challenge, our resolution of the case rests upon the purely legal question of whether the proper standard was applied, and does not require a recitation of the facts or procedural history of the case. 5 commitments, and the remoteness of the crimes; [] (2) [t]he while incarcerated; and [] (3) [a]ny other evidence the court, within its discretion, determines to be relevant in deciding whether a new sentence would result in an unreasonable risk of d ( 1170.126, subd. (g).) the electorate passed proposition 47 in 2014 while . proposition 47 reduces specified narcotics and theft-related crimes from felony offenses to misdemeanors. it also provides that an eligible defendant is entitled to resentencing unless the court, in its discretion, determines that resentencing the [defendant] ( 1170.18, subd. (b).) proposition 47 specifies commit a new violent felony within the meaning of clause (iv) of subparagraph (c) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (e) of section 667,otherwise known as a ( 1170.18, subd. (c).) soon after its passage, courts began considering whether proposition 47 repealed and replaced safety. 6 which focuses on the danger that defendant would commit specific offenses rather than the danger he poses generally, applies to the act because proposition 47 proposition 47 and the act are both part of the penal code. construction . . . mandates that courts, in construing a measure, not undertake to rewrite its unambiguous language. (in re waters of long valley creek stream system (1979) 25 cal.3d 339, 348.) that rule is not applied, however, when it appears clear that a word has been erroneously used, and a judicial correction will best carry out people v. skinner (1985) is, in fact, a drafting error can only be determined by reference to the purpose of the section and the intent of the id. at p. 776.) almost every court to consider this argument has in reaching this conclusion, these courts reasoned that applying 7 : (1) is inconsistent with its the finality of judgments in any case not falling within the 1170.18, subd. (n)); (2) goes far beyond its stated intent to give lower-level criminals who have reduced sentence (voter information guide, gen. elec. (nov. 4, 2014) analysis of prop. 47 by legis. analyst, p. 35) because it allows for the reduction of sentences for hardened criminals with at least two prior serious or violent felonies; and (3) makes little sense because proposition 47 was enacted just two days before the act-year deadline for seeking relief. 4 the issue is currently pending before the 4 our supreme court has granted review on this issue, resulting in the complete or partial depublication of almost every published decision on the issue.
