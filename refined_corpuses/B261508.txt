(a)). defendant pleaded not guilty. at an early disposition hearing on november 6, 2013, defendant withdrew her plea of not guilty to the commercial burglary count and entered a plea of nolo contendere on that count. the court found that there was a fac namely, the early disposition probation report from which the above facts are drawn and accepted the plea. counsel further the identity theft charge was dismissed defendant on formal probation for three years. on august 15, 2014, defendant admitted 1 all further statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise indicated. 2 up an account using a fictitious social security number so that she could later transfer the funds into her personal accountesting officer, or the owner of the social security number, the parties both adopt this characterization of the offense. 3 violating her probation. the court reinstated her probation on the condition that she serve 90 days in county jail for the violation. on december 15, 2014, defendant filed a petition for recall of her sentence and resentencing pursuant to section 1170.18, subdivision (a). defendant argued her conduct placed her within the ambit of newly created section 459.5, subdivision (a), which entering a commercial establishment with intent to commit larceny while that establishment is open during regular business hours, where the value of the property that is taken or intended to be taken does not exceed nine hundred fifty dollars ($950). . . . at the hearing on the petition, the court asked defendant if using a fictitious social security number to open an account could be considered an intent to steal rather than an intent to commit fraud. generally the intent to the court defendant not require any item to be taken. t the court also noted that, ultimately, the court concluded it was not. the court reasonbecause his was an entry of a building with the intent to commit some type of fraud with the use of defendant timely appealed. discussion i. governing principles in november 2014, california voters enacted proposition 47, the safe neighborhoods and schools act, which reclassified certain felony drug and theft offenses as misdemeanors. d (people v. sherow 4 (2015) 239 cal.app.4th 875, 879 (sherow).) shoplifting as defined in new section 459.5. shoplifting is now a misdemeanor unless the ibid.; see  459.5, subd.

( 459.5, subd. (a); see also people v. contreras (2015) 237 cal.app.4th 868, 892.) defendant asserts that she satisfies all four elements. respondent appears to agree as to (or at least does not dispute) elements (1), (2), and (4) in its response brief, in which it argues primarily that the meaning of ambiguity in favor of an interpretation reflecting the commonly understood definition of played merchandise from commercial 3 we accordingly focus our analysis on the third element, whether defendant intended to commit larceny when she entered the bank. 3 in its supplemental brief, respondent changes course and argues for the first time that a bank is not a commercial establishment. we need not and do not consider this belatedly raised contention. (see people v. barragan (2004) 32 cal.4th 236, 254 fn. 5.) we further note that the people have conceded in at least one other case that a bank such as the one defendant entered in this cassection 459.5.

[citation.] [fn. omitted.] (1) achieving (people v. gomez (2008) 43 cal.4th 249, 254-255.) larceny consent. (people v. williams (2013) 57 cal.4th 776, 788.) here, the sparse factual record indicates only that defendant entered the bank with the intention of opening an account. there is no evidence that she intended to achieve possession of any property and carry it away. to the contrary, the parties agree that defendant planned to transfer funds later. perhaps in recognition that the intent to open an account at a bank does not fit neatly within the definition of larceny, defendant argues that she intended to commit theft by false pretenses, which in her view is equivalent to larceny for the purposes of section 459.5. she cites in support of this contention section 490a, which provides that were sub she also relies upon people v. nguyen, supra, 40 cal.app.4th at p. this view has support in recent case law, including people v. vargas (2016) 243 cal.app.4th 1416, 1419, 1427 (vargas)), which we asked the parties to address in supplemental briefing.4 .5 to have the expansive definition prescribed by section 490a and advocated by defendant, we 4 we also asked the parties to address people v. gonzales (2015) 242 cal.app.4th 35, which held that theft by false pretenses did not constitute larceny for purposes of section 459.5 and with which vargas and at least one other court have disagreed. (see vargas, supra, 243 cal.app.4th at pp. 1420, 1424-1426; people v. triplett (2016) 244 cal.app.4th 824.) the supreme court granted review in gonzales on february 17, 2016, however, so we do not consider gonzales in our analysis. arguments nonetheless. 7 are not persuaded that an attempt to open a bank account of unspecified type necessarily constitutes theft by false pretenses. the crime of theft by false pretenses occurs where (1) a defendant makes false pretense or representation, (2) with the intent to defraud an owner of money, labor, or property, and (3) the owner is in fact defrauded and parts with his or her money, labor, or property in reliance upon the representation. (perry v. superior court (1962) 57 cal.2d 276, 283;  532, subd. (a).) courts have held that this crime is committed when a defendant enters a bank or check-cashing establishment and obtains money by cashing forged or fraudulent checks. (see vargas, supra, 243 cal.app.4th at pp. 1420-1421; people v. root, supra, 2016 d.a.r. 2106, 2108. but see people v. bias (feb. 29, 2016, e062949) ___ cal.app.4th ___, 2016 d.a.r. 2027, 2029 [holding that a defendant who entered a bank and attempted to cash a forged check for $587.64 was not eligible for resentencing under proposition 47 because he intended to commit identity theft, which is not within the ambit of section 459.5, subdivision (a)].) like larceny, theft by false pretenses is a crime that requires something be taken. here, however, the record reflects only that defendant intended to open an account when she entered the bank on october 15, 2013; the parties agree that she intended to effectuate fraudulent transfers of funds only at a later point in time. there accordingly is no evidence that she intended to defraud the bank of its money when she opened the account. instead, she was merely laying the groundwork for future theft(s). as defendant ly opening an account with someone social security number belong [sic] of any monetary sum. some later criminal act by appellant was necessary before either the bank or the individual victim would have the case of people v. andra (2007) 156 cal.app.4th 638, 641-642 is instructive. savings accounts at a bank. (ibid.) (id. at p. 642.) she was charged with and convicted of one count of identity theft and one 8 count of theft by false pretenses. (ibid.) on appeal, she contended that the sentence for one of the crimes had to be stayed pursuant to section 654 because she had a single intent and objective. (ibid.) the appellate court disagreed and explained that defendant ew (ibid.) the scheme in people v. andra appears virtually indistinguishable from the one thwarted here. although we do not know what type of account defendant sought to open, the parties agree open up an account, under a false social yet, as people v. andra holds, opening an account to facilitate future thefts is a distinct violation from the subsequent commission of those thefts. there is no evidence in our record indicating that defendant intended to commit the crime of theft by false pretenses concurrently with the distinct crime of opening the account. we therefore conclude that there is no evidence that she intended to commit larceny or the section 490a equivalent of theft by false pretenses when she entered the bank. her crime accordingly does not fall within the definition of shoplifting even if section 459.5 is expansively construed,5 regardless of the value of the property she may have intended to eventually take.6 5 defendant does not argue that identity theft is encompassed within the term we therefore do not consider that issue, though we note that such a theory recently was rejected in people v. bias, supra, 2016 d.a.r. 2027, 2029. 6 her s failure to complete the intended transaction(s) necessarily means the value of the property taken or intended to be taken did not exceed $950, where the record does not detail the nature or value of the transaction(s) she intended to complete at the bank.thank them for their submissions on this question, which we have since determined will not be necessary to our disposition. 9 because we conclude that the facts in this case render defendant ineligible for t. disposition resentencing to a misdemeanor is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports collins, j. we concur: willhite, acting p. j. manella, j.
