(a)1), count 3 multiple identity information theft ( 530.5, subd. (c)(3)), and count 4 unlawful accessing and copying data ( 502, subd. (c)(2)). we affirm the order. factual and procedural background 1. the underlying offenses. brown, a disgruntled former employee of fox filming entertainment (fox), engaged in criminal conduct against fox employees after his termination. a fully executed eight-page discusses his conduct. fox human resources, was a victim of a harassing fax and at least one harassing email sent by mr. brown. the fax was sent brown sent the fax from the [fedex]ventura blvd., studio city, california. law [e]nforcement traced the sending location from the phone number printed on top. each day was sent to franzoi and [fox] executives from lynn[email [s]ocial [s]ecurity number and each email contained inappropriate, embarrresignation. fendant was identified in [fedex] video from january 23, 2009 and january 30, 2009 as being at the studio city location when the fax and email, respectively, 1 subsequent section references are to the penal code. 3 were sent. the january 29th and 30th emails were traced back [through] embedded internet protocol addresses in the email fedex] a series of other emails were sent in march 2009. these emails were directed at various fox executives, including fox human resources department executives who had worked with [d]efendant. some of these emails were sent to fox executives and others were sent to purported employees of the los angeles times newspaper. enefits systems for fox, was a victim on march 20, 2009. two phony emails were sent from maria.gray[email address]. one was sent at 8:02 a.m. to greg gelfan, executive vice president of [fox] at greg[email address], et al., and another at 7:32 a.m. to irene truong, senior financial analyst at irene[email address], et al. each email appeared to be written and sent by maria gray. other emails, defamatory in nature and containing social security numbers with the last digit deleted, were sent to pam saraceno, fox vice president of payroll, and jim gianopoulos, chairman of fox. nine [fox] executives and employees received harassing emails and nine victims were targeted in the emails. home. a computer, a thumb drive and several cd-roms of data were recovered. the thumb drive and two cd-rom[s] each one cd contained several thousand individual names, home addresses, social security numbers and other personal identifying information. the other cd contained several thousand computer contained personal identifying information and 4 privileged material of fox and fox employees. that information included social security numbers of the several victims named above, as well as [s]ocial [s]ecurity numbers and other confidential information of other fox executives, entertainment 2. procedural history. a felony complaint filed march 30, 2009, alleged as count 1 that between january 22 and 30, 2009, brown committed identity theft; as count 2 that on or about march 20, 2009, he committed false personation ( 529); and as count 3 that on or about march 26, 2009, brown committed multiple identity information theft. the complaint also alleged as counts 4 through 7 that between (1) march 27, 2008 and march 26, 2009, (2) june 27, 2008 and march 26, 2009, (3) june 29, 2008 and march 26, 2009, and (4) july 2, 2008 and march 26, 2009, respectively, brown committed unlawful computer accessing and copying ( 502, subd. (c)(2)). the complaint further alleged as count 8 that on or between january 22 and 30, 2009, brown made annoying telephone calls ( 653m, subd. (b)). on july 27, 2009, pursuant to the disposition agreement, brown pled no contest to counts 1, 3, and 4,2 and, the following day, the court suspended imposition of sentence and placed brown on formal felony probation for five years on the conditions, 2 in the case of people v. byron brown (b256937), brown, on november 26, 2014, filed in this court a request that we take judicial notice of the written plea form filed in the trial court on july 27, 2009. we granted the request on december 23, 2014, and we again take judicial notice of the form. (evid. code,  452, subd. (d)(1), 459, subd. (a).) 5 inter alia, that he serve 182 days in local custody with credit for time served, and pay $88,007.77 in restitution. the court dismissed the remaining counts and allegations, contingent upon the continuing validity of the plea agreement. 3. . almost seven years later, on july 18, 2016, brown filed his instant petition for a writ of error coram nobis (hereafter, petition). in it, brown argued (1) new facts existed prior to the judgment that were concealed from brown and the court, and would have prevented rendition of judgment, (2) the new evidence did not go to the merits of the issues of fact determined at trial, and (3) there were valid reasons brown could not make an earlier challenge. he also argued los angeles county decker (the investigating officer), the misconduct; asked that his convictions be vacated; argued he continued to suffer adverse consequences from his convictions; and sought expungement of his convictions. on september 12, 2016, the trial and order re petition for writ of error coram nobishereafter, order) denying the petition.3 on september 21, 2016, brown filed a notice of appeal. 3 raises claims in the petition that essentially challenge the plea and the agreed-upon disposition and negotiated plea, there is no basis upon which to vacate the conviction and judgmen discovered evidence that petitioner cites in support of the petition was necessarily available to the parties at the time the [disposition agreement] was entered into on july 27, 2009. [] the allegations and 6 contentions after examination of the record, appointed appellate counsel filed an opening brief which raised no issues and requested this court to conduct an independent review of the record. by notice filed may 22, 2017, the clerk of this court advised brown to submit within 30 days any contentions, grounds of appeal, or arguments he wished this court to consider. on june 16, 2017, brown filed with this court a 12-page letter (with 14 exhibits) containing his contentions. letter (like his petition) conflates a petition for a writ of error coram nobis with a section 1473.6 motion to vacate judgment; however, as discussed post, these are distinct pleadings and remedies. his letter contains eight enumerated sections coram nobis relief ent [ineffectiv plea [procured] through extrinsic [continuing] the only issue with respect to which he clearly argues he is entitled to section 1473.6 relief is the issue the investigating officer and the prosecutor in this case. we will first relating to the petition, then his section 1473.6 argument as to the alleged misconduct. arguments raised by petitioner, even if true, do not warrant the 7 1. the trial court did not err or abuse its a. applicable law. a writ of error coram nobis is a nonstatutory, common law remedy. (people v. kim (2009) 45 cal.4th 1078, 1091 (kim).) the writ of [error] coram nobis is granted only when three requirements are met. (1) existed which, without any fault or negligence on his part, was not presented to the court at the trial on the merits, and which if presented would have prevented the rendition of th[citations.] (2) discovered evidence . . . [does not go] to the merits of issues tried; issues of fact, once adjudicated, even though incorrectly, cannot be reopened except on motion for new t . . . (3) were not known to him and could not in the exercise of due diligence have been discovered by him at any time substantially (id. at p. 1093.) coram nobis places the burden of proof to overcome the strong presumption in favor of the validity of the judgment on the petitioner. this burden requires the production of strong and convincing evidence. people v. ibanez (1999) 76 cal.app.4th 537, 548-549 (ibanez).) neither a trial court nor an appellate court is required to accept at face value the allegations of the petition even if uncontradicted. (people v. burroughs (1961) 197 cal.app.2d 229, 234.) we review kim, supra, 45 cal.4th at p. 1095.) 8 b. application of the law. (1) the ip report and lasd receipt. and in those sections, brown argues that a yahoo internet protocol (ip) report4 department receipt for seized property (lasd receipt) were newly discovered evidence that undermined his convictions. with respect to count 1, he claimed the ip report demonstrated that no emails originated from fedex . as to counts 3 and 4, he contends the lasd receipt invalidates dthat he recovered a thumb drive containing identifying information warrant. these contentions are barred for at least several reasons. first, the petition was based upon representations unsupported by a declaration or affidavit.5 (cf. ibanez, supra, 76 cal.app.4th at p. 547, fn. 14; people v. crouch (1968) 267 cal.app.2d 64, 67.) indeed, arguments are barred. second, brown failed to satisfy his burden to show the facts upon which he relies . . . could not in the exercise of due diligence have been discovered by him at any time substantially earlier than the time of his motion for the writ (kim, supra, 45 cal.4th at p. 1093, italics added.) to 4 unless otherwise indicated, references to exhibits are to 5 the petition contains a declaration from brown, but the declaration does not expressly refer to the various facts upon which his arguments in his petition are based. 9 aver . . . the time and circumstances under which the facts were discovered, in order that the court can determine as a matter of law whether the litigant proceeded with due diligen (id. at pp. 1096-1097.) third, to the extent brown had the ip report and lasd receipt during his probationary term, which expired in july 2014, his arguments are procedurally barred because he could have made them in a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. (id. at p. 1099.) given these procedural bars, we need not reach the merits the purported new evidence goes to the factual issues that formed the basis for the charges and no contest pleas, and thus it is not a proper basis for a writ of error coram nobis. (kim, supra, 45 cal.4th at p. 1093; people v. welch (1964) 61 cal.2d 786, 794.) and in any event, an examination of the evidence reveals that it does not have prevented rendition of the kim, at p. 1103.) (2) ineffective assistance of counsel. ve] in that section, brown asserts his trial counsel failed to make reasonable investigations, violating his right to effective assistance of counsel, and he cites 10 instances in which his trial counsel allegedly misstated factual information. . is an inappropriate ground for relief on coram nobiskim, supra, 45 cal.4th at p. 1104.) thus, this claim was properly rejected by the trial court. (3) fraud on the court. , ,asserts that fictitious invoice used to determine the 10 victim restitution amount of $88.007.77. however, brown concedes that on july 27, 2009, the exhibit containing this invoice was attached to the agreement filed in court, before being removed; further, exhibit o to he was told in december 2013 that a copy of the declaration was in the court file. because he reasonably could have discovered the allegedly fictitious invoice long before he filed his petition in 2016, he has not shown due diligence with respect to this claim. (4) plea procured through fraud. in it, brown cites 13 alleged facts, presumably constituting the extrinsic fraud.6 we have carefully 6 [fox]) contacted mr. decker on two separate occasions and filed [fox] uses law enforcement as a deterrent (see attached exhibit idecker realized [fox]judge melvin sandvig in order to obtain a search & arrest (5) mr. decker arrested me twice causing me to perjury, mr. decker stated finding [sic] a thumb drive containing identifying information from my residence which is false(7) [the prosecutor] conspired and filed a false seven felony criminal complaint retained defense attorneys did nothing such as: (request a bail reduction, argue, file any motions on my behalf, request counsel informed me that a court order denied me from viewing me of any exculpatcounsel informed m[c]opies in 11 regarding the alleged facts, the exhibits he cites in support, and the petition. the assertions in his letter are conclusory, factually unsubstantiated, and do not show that some fact existed which, without any fault or negligence on his part, was not presented to the court at the trial on the merits, and which if presented would have prevented the rendition of the judgment. (kim, supra, 45 cal.4th at p. 1093, italics added.) nor, for reasons similar to those we previously have discussed, has brown demonstrated due diligence regarding his assertions. (5) lasd retribution. in it, brown cites various alleged events occurring on and after september 24, 2016, as evidence that decker, in investigating brown. however, in order for the remedy of a writ of error coram nobis to apply, been . . . kim, supra, 45 cal.4th at p. 1093.) in this case, the time of the judgment was july 28, 2009, when the court orally granted probation. ( 1237, studio city, california (the time i was present) and a plea was conviction defense counsel met with members of my family to discuss my case and view discovery (without my permission). during the meeting counsel stated all emails originated from [c]opies in studio city, california (the time i was present) and that a plea was necessary prior to preliminary three of the eight counts without the ability to view any 12 subd. (a); see people v. zelinski (1979) 24 cal.3d 357, 368; cf. people v. scott (2012) 203 cal.app.4th 1303, 1324.) even if after that date, therefore, a writ of error coram nobis relief is unavailable. the trial court did not err or abuse its discretion by 7 2. the trial court did not err or abuse its section 1473.6 provides a statutory motion to vacate a judgment. (people v. picklesimer (2010) 48 cal.4th 330, 337, fn. 2.) no longer unlawfully imprisoned or restrained may prosecute a motion to vacate a judgment for any of the following reasons: [] (1) newly discovered evidence of fraud by a government official that comples case, is conclusive, and points unerringly to his or her innocence. [] . . . [] (3) newly discovered evidence of misconduct by a government official committed in the underlying case that resulted in fabrication of evidence that was substantially material and probative on the a section 1473.6 motion to vacate judgment is similar to a habeas corpus petition in some respects ( 1473.6, subd. (c)) but, unlike a habeas petition, the section 1473.6 motion is brought when a person is not unlawfully imprisoned or restrained. the burden of proof on a person making a section 1473.6 motion is the 7 consequences of his convictions. since we conclude the trial court otherwise properly denied his petition, those allegations afford no basis for relief. 13 same as the burden of proof for prosecuting a writ of habeas corpus ( 1473.6, subd. (c)), and thus, a petitioner must prove the facts establishing a basis for relief by a preponderance of the evidence (cf. in re bell (2017) 2 cal.5th 1300, 1305). conclusory allegations made without any explanation of the basis for the allegations do not warrant relief. (cf. people v. duvall (1995) 9 cal.4th 464, 474.) argues the granting of a section 1473.6, subdivisions (a)(1) and (3) motion to vacate judgment was proper based on alleged misconduct by decker and the prosecutor in this case. to summarize, brown asserts decker committed misconduct by (1) committ[ing] (2) arresting br manufacturing evidence used to convict brown, (4) filing a false police report, (5) knowingly filing a false criminal complaint, and (6) withholding exculpatory evidence. again, wthe above points in his letter, the exhibits he cites in support, and the petition. simply put, the assertions in his letter are conclusory, they are not factually supported, they do not demonstrate misconduct on the part of decker and/or the prosecutor in this case, and they do not satisfy the requirements of section 1473.6, subdivision (a)(1) or (3). brown has also failed to demonstrate he filed his section 1473.6 motion within one year [t]he date the moving party discovered, or could have discovered with the exercise of due diligence, additional evidence of the misconduct or fraud by a government official beyond the .( 1473.6, subd. (d)(1).) the trial court did not err or abuse its discretion to the extent it 14 none of the arguments in , and none of the issues in his july 18, 2016 filing, whether it is designated a petition or section 1473.6 motion, entitle him to relief. we have examined the entire record and are satisfied counsel has complied fully with counsels responsibilities.
