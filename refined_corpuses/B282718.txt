(a), 189),1 conspiracy to commit murder and aggravated assault ( 182, subd. (a)(1)), assault with a firearm ( 245, subd. (a)(2)) and carrying objects into jail to facilitate an escape from custody ( 4535). the jury also found true several special firearm-use and criminal street gang enhancement allegations. verdugo was sentenced to an aggregate state prison term of 57 years eight months to life. we affirmed the convictions on appeal but provisions. (people v. barraza et al. (june 17, 2008, b194415) [nonpub. opn].) on march 16, 2017 verdugo moved to modify his sentence, challenging the $10,855.50 victim restitution fine imposed under section 1202.4, subdivision (b). the trial court request to modify the fine to $200 based on insufficient evidence of his inability to pay, but ordered the fine decreased to $10,000, the statutory maximum. ( 1202.4, subd. (b)(1).) verdugo filed a timely notice of appeal from the order. discussion we appointed counsel to represent verdugo on appeal. after examination of the record, counsel filed an opening brief in which no issues were raised. on january 19, 2018 we advised verdugo he had 30 days within which to submit any contentions or issues he wished us to consider. on february 20, 2018 we received a typed four-page supplemental brief in which verdugo challenged the september 28, 2006 judgment, asserting: (1) his conviction of 1 statutory references are to this code. 3 first degree murder was unconstitutional because he was charged with violating section 187, rather than sections 189 and 190. (2) he was denied a fair trial because his probation report was lost or destroyed. (3) the firearm-use enhancement imposed pursuant to section 12022.53, subdivision (d), did not apply to the facts of this case because the shots were fired from a parked car, not a moving car. (4) his trial counsel provided constitutionally ineffective assistance by failing to request a jury instruction regarding corroboration of accomplice testimony. verdugoo contest on appeal the issues he raises in his supplemental brief has long since passed. furthermore, any issues pertaining to the judgment in this case other than the propriety of the march 16, 2017 order modifying the restitution fine are beyond the scope of this appeal. with respect to that order, the trial court properly corrected an unauthorized sentence by decreasing the amount of the restitution fine to the statutory maximum. as for the sentencing purported failure to consider evidence of inability to pay a restitution fine in excess of $200, verdugo forfeited this claim by failing to object at the sentencing hearing. (see people v. nelson (2011) 51 cal.4th 198, 227 [at the time of for the court to and defendant could have objected at the time if he believed .) moreover, on the merits nothing in the record sclaim of inability to pay beyond his then-impending incarceration. (ibid.) we have examined the record and are satisfied v appellate attorney has fully complied with the responsibilities of 4 counsel and no arguable issue exists.
