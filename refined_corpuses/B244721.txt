filed 9/17/13 p. v. blake ca2/4 not to be published in the official reports california rules of court, rule 8.1115(a), prohibits courts and parties from citing or relying on opinions not certified for publication or ordered published, except as specified by rule 8.1115(b). this opinion has not been certified for publication or ordered published for purposes of rule 8.1115. in the court of appeal of the state of california second appellate district division four the people, plaintiff and respondent, v. anthony blake, defendant and appellant. b244721 (los angeles county super. ct. no. na092660) appeal from a judgment of the superior court of los angeles county, charles d. sheldon, judge. affirmed. craig c. kling, under appointment by the court of appeal, and anthony blake, in pro. per., for defendant and appellant. no appearance for plaintiff and respondent. ______________________________2defendant anthony blake appeals from the judgment entered after his jury conviction of possession of a firearm by a felon. his appointed counsel filed a wende brief. (people v. wende (1979) 25 cal.3d 436.) we advised defendant that he had 30 days within which to submit any arguments he wished this court to consider and permitted him to file a belated supplemental brief in pro. per. we have reviewed his response and the record on appeal in accordance with people v. wende. on june 23, 2012, a chevrolet suburban with nine occupants was stopped by police officers garrido and jarman, after it made an abrupt u-turn. defendant was one of four passengers seated in the middle row of the vehicle. officer garrido opened the cargo area door and saw an individual seated in that area pass a white shirt to defendant. officer jarman saw defendant bend over as if reaching under the seat. after defendant exited the vehicle, the officer retrieved a loaded firearm from under the seat where defendant had been sitting. the white shirt was found under the front passenger seat. defendant was given his miranda1 rights at the scene. he asked officer garrido whether the other occupants of the car would be released if he told the truth. the officer responded that he would like to release those who had not done anything wrong, but he needed to know the truth. defendant then told the officer the firearm was his. defendant was charged with possession of a firearm by a felon. (pen. code,  29800, subd. (a)(1).)2 three prior felonies were alleged, one of which was a prior strike conviction. the court denied defendants marsden3 motion on the eve of trial. the jury convicted defendant as charged, and the court found the prior conviction allegations to be true. defendant was sentenced to a mid-term of two years. the sentence was doubled to four years because of his prior strike conviction. two additional 1 miranda v. arizona (1966) 384 u.s. 436. 2 unless otherwise indicated, all statutory references are to the penal code. 3 people v. marsden (1970) 2 cal.3d 118. 3years were imposed for his prior felony convictions, for a total of six years in prison. the third prior conviction was stricken. defendant received 236 days of custody credit and was charged various fines and fees. our review of the record indicates that, as to the fines and fees, the courts pronouncement on the record was imprecise: like i typically do 240, 1203, $50 1465.9, $50, $50 70770 government code that is court security and you will have to pay those. the minute order and abstract of judgment correctly list these fines and fees as $40 per section 1465.8, $30 per government code section 70373, $240 per section 1202.4, subdivision (b) and $240 per section1202.45 (suspended). the minute order and abstract of judgment control over a conflicting reporters transcript because they are detailed and more reliable. (see people v. cleveland (2004) 32 cal.4th 704, 768.) in his supplemental letter brief, defendant argues his trial counsel was ineffective in failing to seek suppression of his statement admitting ownership of the firearm because he also told the officers he was sc[h]izophrenic and needed protection from the gove[r]nment and bin laden. defendant claims his statement was inflammatory . . . based on the fact it brought into question [his] state of mind at the time of [his] arrest. the record does not include these additional statements. defendants admission of his firearm ownership was hardly inflammatory. defendant also argues counsel was ineffective for failing to ask the judge to instruct the jury on access to a firearm, a lesser charge. framed more properly, this appears to be a reference to the principle that possession may not be inferred from mere presence or access, without more. (see people v. zyduck (1969) 270 cal.app.2d 334, 336.) that principle has no application in this case because the jury was entitled to believe defendant admitted the gun was his. no arguable issues for appeal exist. 4disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports epstein, p. j. we concur: manella, j. suzukawa, j.
