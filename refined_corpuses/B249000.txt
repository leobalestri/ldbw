filed 5/30/14 p. v. torres ca2/1 not to be published in the official reports california rules of court, rule 8.1115(a), prohibits courts and parties from citing or relying on opinions not certified for publication or ordered published, except as specified by rule 8.1115(b). this opinion has not been certified for publication or ordered published for purposes of rule 8.1115. in the court of appeal of the state of california second appellate district division one the people, plaintiff and respondent, v. roberto e. torres, defendant and appellant. b249000 (los angeles county super. ct. no. ka086731) appeal from a judgment of the superior court of los angeles county. bruce f. marrs, judge. affirmed. ______ verna wefald, under appointment by the court of appeal, for defendant and appellant. kamala d. harris, attorney general, dane r. gillette, chief assistant attorney general, lance e. winters, assistant attorney general, chung mar and jessica c. owen, deputy attorneys general, for plaintiff and respondent. ______ 2 a jury convicted roberto e. torres of six counts: (1) two counts of sexual intercourse or sodomy with a child 10 years of age or younger (pen. code,  288.7, subd. (a))1 (counts 1 and 2); (2) two counts of oral copulation or sexual penetration with a child 10 years of age or younger ( 288.7, subd. (b) (counts 3 and 4); (3) one count of exhibiting harmful matter to a minor ( 288.2) (count 5); and (4) one count of commission of a lewd act upon a child under 14 years of age ( 288, subd. (a)) (count 6). brother. the trial court sentenced torres to a state prison term of 80 years to life, consisting of consecutive terms of 25 years to life prescribed by section 288.7, subdivision (a), for counts 1 and 2 and consecutive terms of 15 years to life prescribed by section 288.7, subdivision (b), for counts 3 and 4. the court imposed concurrent sentences of the two-year midterm for the section 288.2 violation in count 5 and of the six-year midterm for the section 288, subdivision (a), violation in count 6. torres appealed, contending that his sentence constitutes cruel and unusual punishment under the state and federal constitutions. we disagree and thus affirm the judgment. discussion court, but the underlying disputed facts must be viewed in the light most favorable to the people v. martinez (1999) the penalty for crimes is the province of the legislature, which is in the best position to evaluate the gravity of different crimes and to make judgments among different penological approaches. [citations.] only in the rarest of cases could a court declare that the length of a sentence mandated by the legislature is unconstitutionally excessive. id. at p. 494.) against this backdrop, under the california constitution, a sentence may violate the prohibition against cruel or unusual punishment only if it is so disproportionate to the 1 statutory references are to the penal code. 3 in re lynch (1972) 8 cal.3d 410, 424.) the appellate court considers (1) the nature of the offense and the offento ow the punishment compares with punishments for more serious crimes in the jurisdiction; and (3) how the punishment compares with the punishment for the same offense in other jurisdictions. (id. at pp. 425-his sentence is disproportionate to his level of culpability. (people v. wingo (1975) 14 cal.3d 169, 174.) regarding the nature of the offenses, torres contends that his sentence of 80 years to life is cruel and unusual because it is tantamount to a sentence of life without the possibility of parole despite lure of [victim] jane doe to remember many details, and the failure of [victim] john doe to report the as to the nature of the offender, torres maintains that, l young enough that he report rating him as a moderate-to-low risk for reoffending and the fact his only prior conviction is for petty theft. looking at the nature of the offenses and the offender, however, demonstrates that although torres complains about the evidence, as determined by the jury, which evaluated all of the evidence, the nature of the offenses shows that torres committed sexual abuses of two child victims who are both family members. given the seriousness of the offenses and the violations of trust of two young family members, suggests that his sentence is disproportionate to the crimes he committed. (people v. szadziewicz (2008) 161 cal.app.4th 823, 845 commission substantially outweigh thethe punishment for the crimes against his niece, comprising the 80-year-to-life term, is set by the legislature, which prescribed a 25-year-to-life penalty for sexual intercourse or sodomy with a child 4 10 years of age or younger under section 288.7, subdivision (a), and a 15-year-to-life penalty for oral copulation or sexual penetration under section 288.7, subdivision (b). ren, who all in re wells (1975) 46 cal.app.3d 592, 599.) the 80-year-to-life term is given the evidence of sexual intercourse, sodomy, oral copulation and sexual penetration against the nieceher 2 as to punishment for other crimes in california, torres contends that his sentence for multiple sexual offenses is disproportionate that for first degree murder. torres, however, committed multiple sexual abuse crimes against children commission of a single act of murder, while heinous and severely punished, cannot be people v. cooper (1996) 43 cal.app.4th 815, 826.) courts consistently have rejected cruel and unusual punishment challenges to sentences that exceed a defendawhen based on the commission of multiple sexual offenses. (see, e.g., people v. wallace (1993) 14 cal.app.4th 651, 666-667; people v. bestelmeyer (1985) 166 cal.app.3d 520, 528-532.) torres does not address the penalty in other jurisdictions for similar crimes and thus does not meet his burden to show cruel or unusual punishment on that basis. torres claims that his sentence evolving standards of decencydoes not provide a distinct and separate cruel-and-unusual-punishment analysis under the federal constitution. we note that, under the federal constitution, the -and-unusual- ewing v. 2 as noted, the trial court imposed concurrent terms for the offense of exhibiting harmful matter to a minor in count 5 and the offense of commission of a lewd act upon a child under 14 years of age in count 6. 5 california court [regarding cruel and unusual punishment] are similar to those developed by the united states supreme court . . . [and] the federal high court[] [has] reminde[d] that legislatures necessarily possess in determining the types and limits of punishments for crpeople v. barrera (1993) 14 cal.app.4th 1555, 1566, fn. 7.) given the narrow proportionality review permitted and the required deference to legislative sentencing determinations, cruel-and-unusual-punishment argument thus fares no better under the federal constitution.
