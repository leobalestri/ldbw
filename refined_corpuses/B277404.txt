the closet door was open and unlocked. inside the closet was a blue duffle bag, inside the duffle was the shotgun, loosely wrapped in orange plastic. the shotgun was loaded with 20-gauge rounds in each barrel. twelve additional loose rounds were inside the duffle. right outside the closet, owen found mail addressed to bacon. owen found the shotgun 4 [a] couple minutes maybe, mafter he began searching the closet. bacon told the deputies that he had been staying in the converted garage for approximately two years. caruso had been staying with him for two months, and they both slept in the bedroom. bacon denied that the shotgun, ammunition, methamphetamine, scales, and pipe belonged to him. he stated that he did not know how they had gotten in the residence. he admitted using methamphetamine on a daily basis. the crystalline substance was tested and determined to be a substance containing methamphetamine, with a net weight of 6.1301 grams. bacon stipulated that he had suffered a prior felony conviction. he presented no evidence. 2. procedure trial was by jury. bacon was convicted of possession of a firearm by a felon ( 29800, subd. (a)(1)), possession of ammunition by a felon ( 30305, subd. (a)(1)), possession of a controlled substance while armed with a firearm (health & saf. code,  11370.1, subd. (a)); and misdemeanor possession of a controlled substance, a lesser included offense of possession of a controlled substance for sale. (health & saf. code,  11377, subd. (a).) bacon admitted serving a prior prison term within the meaning of section 667.5, subdivision (b). the trial court sentenced him to a term of five years. it imposed a restitution fine, a suspended parole revocation restitution fine, a court operations assessment, and a criminal conviction assessment. bacon appeals. 5 discussion 1. lesser included offense instruction bacon was charged in count 3 with possession of a controlled substance, methamphetamine, while armed with a loaded firearm, in violation of health and safety code section 11370.1, subdivision (a). defense counsel did not request, and the trial court did not give, an instruction on simple possession on count 3, and the jury convicted bacon as charged. bacon contends the trial court prejudicially erred by failing to sua sponte instruct on simple possession of methamphetamine. we disagree. a trial court must instruct the jury on all general principles of law relevant to the issues raised by the evidence, including lesser included offenses, whether or not the defendant makes a formal request. instruction on a lesser included offense is required when there is evidence the defendant is guilty of the lesser offense but not of the greater. (people v. banks (2014) 59 cal.4th 1113, 1159-1160, disapproved on another ground by people v. scott (2015) 61 cal.4th 363, 391, fn. 3; people v. whalen (2013) 56 cal.4th 1, 68.) substantial evidence is evidence that a reasonable jury could find persuasive. (people v. benavides (2005) 35 cal.4th 69, 102.) we independently review the question of whether the trial court erred by failing to instruct on a lesser included offense. (people v. banks, at p. 1160; people v. booker (2011) 51 cal.4th 141, 181.) necessarily included in a greater offense if either the statutory elements of the greater offense, or the facts actually alleged in the accusatory pleading, include all the elements of the lesser 6 offense, such that the greater cannot be committed without also when applying the chosen to allege a way of committing the greater offense that necessarily subsumes a lesser offense, and so long as there is substantial evidence that the defendant committed the lesser offense without also committing the greater, the trial court must people v. banks, supra, 59 cal.4th at p. 1160, italics omitted; people v. james (2014) 230 cal.app.4th 1256, 1260.) health and safety code section 11370.1, subdivision (a) any amount of a substance containing . . . methamphetamine . . . while armed with a loaded, operable firearm is guilty of a felony . . . the statute defines armed with as available for immediate offensive or defensive (ibid.) bacon acknowledges that simple possession of methamphetamine is not a lesser included offense of possession while armed under the elements test. (see people v. williams (2009) 170 cal.app.4th 587, 644-test, possession of methamphetamine under health & saf. code,  11377, subd. (a) is not a lesser included offense of possession of a controlled substance while armed under health & saf. code,  11370.1, subd. (a), because a violation of  11370.1 may be based on possession of substances that are not included in  11377, subd. (a)]; people v. sosa (2012) 210 cal.app.4th 946, 949 [it is possible to violate health & saf. code,  11370.1, subd. (a) without violating health & saf. code,  11350, subd. (a), because the lists of controlled substances in the two statutes 7 differ].) however, bacon is correct that simple possession was a lesser included offense under the accusatory pleading test. the information here specified the particular substance in question. it alleged, as , in the county of los angeles, the crime of possession of a controlled substance with firearm, in violation of health and safety code section 11370.1(a), a [f]elony, was committed by ronnie eugene bacon, who did unlawfully possess methamphetamine while armed with a loaded, operable firearm, to wit: handgfull capitalization omitted.) thus, based on the language of the pleading, if bacon committed the offense of possession of methamphetamine while armed, he necessarily committed the lesser offense of possession of methamphetamine. we need not determine whether the trial court erred by failing to instruct on the lesser included offense, however, because assuming arguendo omission of the instruction was error, it was harmless. the failure to instruct on a lesser included offense requires reversal only if an examination of the entire record establishes a reasonable probability that the error affected the outcome. (people v. wyatt (2012) 55 cal.4th 694, 698; people v. beltran (2013) 56 cal.4th 935, 955.) no such probability exists here. to prove possession of a controlled substance while armed with a firearm, the people were required to show, in addition to possessing the contraband he (1) had a loaded, operable firearm available for immediate offensive or defensive use; and (2) he knew that he had the firearm available for immediate offensive or defensive use. (health & saf. code,  11370.1, subd. (a); 8 people v. mena (2005) 133 cal.app.4th 702, 706; calcrim no. 2303.) the meaning of health and people v. superior court (martinez) (2014) 225 cal.app.4th 979, 989-990 (martinez).) knowledge that the gun is loaded and operable is not an element of the offense. (people v. heath (2005) 134 cal.app.4th 490, 492.) the jury convicted bacon of possession of a firearm by a felon and possession of a controlled substance. therefore, based on the instructions given, it concluded bacon knowingly possessed both the firearm and a usable quantity of character as a controlled substance. there was no dispute that the shotgun was loaded and operable. the only element remaining to prove the health and safety code section 11370.1 charge was that bacon, while possessing the controlled substance, had the firearm available for immediate offensive or defensive use. there was ample evidence supporting such a finding. for example, in martinez, the defendant had a firearm available for immediate use within the meaning of health and safety code section 11370.1 when he was found in the kitchen with heroin; a sawed-off shotgun and marijuana were found either in the kitchen or in a bedroom; and another sawed-off shotgun and a rifle were found in a closet. (martinez, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at pp. 985, 989.) similarly, in people v. molina (1994) 25 cal.app.4th 1038, the evidence was sufficient to hold the defendant to answer on a health and safety code section 11370.1 charge. the defendant was truck9 toiletry bag, which contained baggies of drugs. a loaded gun was in a duffle bag full of clothing located behind the back seat, which seat. (id. at pp. 1041-1042, 1043-1044.) and in the analogous context of a section 12022 firearm enhancement,2 people v. bland (1995) 10 cal.4th 991 concluded the defendant was armed with a firearm in the commission of a felony when an assault weapon was under his bed in his bedroom and cocaine was found in his bedroom closet. (id. at p. 995.) bland explained that when a firearm is found in close proximity to the illegal drugs in a place frequented by the defendant, the jury may reasonably infer that the firearm was available for the defendant to put to immediate use. (id. at pp. 1002-1003.) similarly, here there was strong evidence the firearm was immediately available to bacon for offensive or defensive use. bacon was in the living room of the converted garage, along with the methamphetamine. the shotgun was in the closet in the bedroom. the closet was open and unlocked. the duffle bag itself was not locked. sergeant owen, who found the 2 health and safety code section 11370.1, as originally stats. 1989, ch. 1041,  1.) section while in the impeople v. pea (1999) 74 cal.app.4th 1078, 1083) armed witavailable for immedi (stats. 1991, ch. 469,  1.) this definition is consistent with the well- given to firearm enha(martinez, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at pp. 989-990.) 10 shot[a] couple minutes maybeafter he started looking inside the closet. the orange plastic was only loosely wrapped around the gun, and owen simply pulled it off. thus, bacon had ready access to the shotgun. to retrieve it, all bacon needed to do was walk into the bedroom and pull it from the duffle bag in the closet, which could have been accomplished within moments. in contrast, there was a dearth of evidence suggesting the firearm was not immediately available to bacon. bacon does not explain what evidence would have supported a finding he was not armed within the meaning of health and safety code section 11370.1, except to point out the gun was in the duffle bag in a closet, wrapped in plastic. these facts, however, provide little support for a finding the shotgun was unavailable for his immediate use. moreover, the defense theory was that the people had failed to prove bacon possessed or had knowledge of the shotgun, which was not in plain sight and could have belonged to one of the other persons who frequented the property. the defense did not otherwise argue to the jury that the firearm was not immediately available for ba given the evidence and the defense argument, there is no reasonable probability the jury would have rendered a more favorable verdict had the trial court given the challenged instruction. 2. correction of the abstract of judgment the trial court sentenced bacon to a term of five years, configured as follows. on count 3, possession of a controlled substance with a firearm, the court imposed the upper term of four years, plus an additional year for the section 667.5, subdivision (b) prior prison term enhancement. it stayed sentence on counts 1 and 2 pursuant to section 654. the court 11 initially stated it was imposing a consecutive one-year sentence on count 6, possession of a controlled substance, but then corrected itself and ordered sentence on count 6 stayed pursuant to section 654. the abstract of judgment does not reflect any term, imposed or stayed, on count 6. verbal pronouncement, this court has the inherent power to correct such clerical error on appeal, whether on our own motion or upon application of the parties. (people v. jones (2012) 54 cal.4th 1, 89; see people v. mitchell (2001) 26 cal.4th 181, 185; people v. walz (2008) 160 cal.app.4th 1364, 1367, fn. 3.) we therefore order this clerical error corrected. 12 disposition the clerk of the superior court is directed to modify the abstract of judgment to reflect a one-year sentence on count 6, stayed pursuant to penal code section 654, and to forward a copy of the corrected abstract of judgment to the department of corrections and rehabilitation. as so modified, the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports dhanidina, j. we concur: edmon, p. j. lavin, j. judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
