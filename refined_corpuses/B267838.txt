(b)). purcell moved to modify his sentenc 3051), which was filed on october 2, 2015; the trial court summarily denied the motion on october 8, 2015. on october 26, 2015, purcell filed an in propria persona notice of appeal from the order. we appointed counsel to represent purcell on appeal. after examination of the record, counsel filed an opening brief in which no issues were raised. on february 2, 2016, we advised purcell he had 30 days within which to submit any contentions or issues he wished us to consider. we received no response. however, attached to -page petition for modification of his sentence. section 3051 is not a resentencing statute. because purcell has no basis to seek resentencing under section 3051, we treat his motion as one made under section 1170, subdivision (d), the general resentencing statute. section 1170, subdivision (d)(1) enables a defendant to recall the current sentence and seek resentencing if the request is made within 120 days of the date of commitment. in this case, purcell petitioned for resentencing well beyond that deadline. after that time, the trial court no longer had jurisdiction to resentence purcell. (see people v. loper compare people v. teal (2014) 60 cal.4th 595 [appeal lies where denial of petition affects substantial rights].) as a result, the order issued by the trial court in this case is 1 statutory references are to the penal code. 3 not appealable, and we dismiss the appeal. (id. at pp. 1165-1166; people v. chlad (1992) 6 cal.app.4th 1719, 1725-1726.) disposition the appeal is dismissed. zelon, j. we concur: perluss, p. j. segal, j.
