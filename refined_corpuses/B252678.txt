his sentences for his burglary and robbery convictions should have been stayed under section 654; his stayed $280 parole revocation restitution fine must be reversed because his sentence does not include a parole period; and his abstract of judgment must be modified to reflect that he was sentenced to life with, not without, the possibility of parole for his attempted murder conviction and to correct the spelling of his middle name. we firearm allegations as to thomreduced to a lesser included violation of section 12022.5, subdivision (a) and remand the matter for resentencing;

(1978) 84 cal.app.3d 907, 911; people v. richardson (2008) 43 cal.4th 959, 1024.) which may be considered in making the determination of aiding and abetting are: presence at the scene of the crime, companionship, and conduct before and after the (people v. campbell (1994) 25 cal.app.4th 402, 409.) defendant aided and abetted the crime is a question of fact, and on appeal all conflicts in (ibid.) there is evidence that shows, and the prosecutor argued to the jury, that thompson was not the shooter. accordingly, culpability, if any, was as an aider and abettor. thompson contends that the evidence is insufficient to establish his culpability as an aider and abettor because the evidence does not show that he had an agreement or plan with thomas to rob terrance or that he even had any communication with thomas. evidence was adduced at trial from which a reasonable juror could infer 8 s that thompson and thomas knew each otherday of the shooting, thompson exchanged a number of text messages with terrance about arranging to meet at when thompson entered the apartment, he looked straight ahead at terrance. when roosevelt greeted thompson, thompson said nothing. immediately after entering and just before the first shot was fired, thompson turned to leave the apartment despite having exchanged numerous texts with terrance over several hours to arrange to meet with him. thompson did not make an attempt to cover himself when the first shot was fired, suggesting that he was not surprised when a gun was fired in his direction from close range. he did not stop and say anything to terrance or roosevelt on his way out of the apartment or return to the apartment to aid terrence or roosevelt. such evidence is sufficient for the jury to conclude that and thus was an aider and abettor. ii. through (d) firearm allegations for his burglary conviction subdivisions (b) through (d) firearm allegations with respect to his burglary conviction must be reversed because burglary is not an offense to which section 12022.53 applies. respondent properly concedes the contention, but argues that we may instead impose and stay a firearm allegation under section 12022.5, subdivision (a) because the allegations under section 12022.53 gave thomas notice that his conduct could also violate section 12022.5. 9 section 12022.53, subdivision (a) lists the felonies to which the provisions of subdivisions (b), (c), and (d) of section 12022.53 apply.4 burglary is not among the listed felonies. accordingly, the juryng on the section 12022.53, subdivision were improper. when an appellate court overturns a firearm enhancement that is not supported by sufficient evidence or that does not apply to the offense of which the defendant was convicted, it may nevertheless impose a lesser included firearm enhancement that is supported by substantial evidence and applies to the offense of conviction. (people v. fialho (2014) 229 cal.app.4th 1389, 1394-1397; people v. allen (1985) 165 cal.app.3d 616, 627; see people v. strickland (1974) 11 cal.3d 946, 959-961.) with respect to the commission of a felony listed in subdivision (a) of section 12022.53, subdivision (b) of that section and subdivision (d) applies to a person who personally and intentionally discharges a firearm and proximately causes great bodily injury . . . or death5 section 12022.5, subdivision (a)6 4 section 12022.53, subdivision (a) provides, felonies: [] (1) section 187 (murder).

(people v. allen, supra, 165 cal.app.3d at p. 627.) iii. section 654 stay of the burglary and robbery sentences and related firearm enhancement thomas contends that his concurrent sentences for his first degree burglary and robbery convictions should have been stayed under section 654 because those offenses (c) notwithstanding any other provision of law, any person who, in the commission of a felony specified in subdivision (a), personally and intentionally discharges a firearm, shall be punished by an additional and consecutive term of imprisonment in the state prison for 20 years. (d) notwithstanding any other provision of law, any person who, in the commission of a felony specified in subdivision (a), section 246, or subdivision (c) or (d) of section 26100, personally and intentionally discharges a firearm and proximately causes great bodily injury, as defined in section 12022.7, or death, to any person other than an accomplice, shall be punished by an additional and consecutive term of imprisonment in the state prison for 25 years to life. 6 except as provided in subdivision (b) [applicable to the use of an assault weapon or machine gun], any person who personally uses a firearm in the commission of a felony or attempted felony shall be punished by an additional and consecutive term of imprisonment in the state prison for 3, 4, or 10 years, unless use of a firearm is an element of that offense. 11 were the underlying felonies for his first degree felony murder conviction. thompson makes the same contention with respect to the concurrent sentence for his first degree burglary conviction and the accompanying enhancement for firearm use by a principal under section 12022, subdivision (a)(1). respondent agrees, as do we. the trial court instructed the jury that the underlying felony murder theory as to thomas and thompson were first degree residential burglary and/or first degree residential robbery. the jury convicted thomas of first degree felony murder and, as relevant, first degree burglary and first degree residential robbery. the trial court sentenced thomas to concurrent, four-year, middle term sentences for his burglary and robbery convictions.7 the jury convicted thompson of first degree felony murder and first degree residential burglary and found true the allegation that a principal used a firearm. the trial court sentenced thompson to a consecutive, four-year, middle term sentence for his burglary conviction and a concurrent one-year term for the firearm enhancement. when a defendant has been found guilty of first degree murder based on a felony-murder theory, section 654 requires that the punishment for the underlying felony be stayed. (people v. montes, supra, 58 cal.4th at p. 898; people v. boyd (1990) 222 cal.app.3d 541, 575-576.) section 654 also requires that the punishment for any enhancement attached to the underlying felony be stayed. (people v. montes, supra, 58 cal.4th at p. 898; people v. calles, supra, 209 cal.app.4th at p. 1221.) because underlying felonies for his first degree felony murder conviction, the trial court should have stayed imposition of sentence for those convictions under section 654. likewise, felony murder conviction, the trial court should have stayed imposition of sentence for 7 the trial court properly stayed, under section 654, the section 12022.53, convictions. (people v. montes (2014) 58 cal.4th 809, 898; people v. calles (2012) 209 .) 12 that conviction and for the attached section 12022, subdivision (a)(1) enhancement for use of a firearm by a principal. we order thomas sentences for his burglary and robbery convictions and thompsonsubdivision (a)(1) firearm enhancement stayed under section 654. we further order that iv. thomas argues that his stayed $280 parole revocation restitution fine under section 1202.45 must be reversed because his sentence does not include a parole period. respondent rightly agrees. when sentence does not allow for parole, an additional parole revocation restitution fine under section 1202.45 is improper. (people v. oganesyan (1999) 70 cal.app.4th 1178, 1185.) a parole revocation restitution fine under section 1202.45 is mandatory, however, in every case in which there is at least one count with a determinate sentence, even when the defendant is sentenced to death on other counts. (people v. brasure (2008) 42 cal.4th 1037, 1075.) although a parole revocation restitution fine must be imposed in cases in which there is one count with a determinate sentence, such a fine may not be imposed when the determinate sentence has been stayed under section 654. (people v. pearson the use of a conviction for any punitive purpose if the sentence on that conviction is people v. cruz (2012) 207 cal.app.4th 664, 672-673, fn. 8 [at least for ex post people v. hannah (1999) 73 cal.app.4th 270, 274-275 [a trial court may not impose a section 1202.45 fine if it suspended the state prison subject to a parole period and will not be absent a revocation of her probation and people v. hanson (2000) 23 cal.4th 355, 361-362 [the restitution fine under section 1202.4, subdivision (b) is a criminal penalty or punishment]; people v. le (2006) 136 cal.app.4th 925, 933 [section 654s ban on multiple 13 punishments is violated if the trial court considers a sentence that should have been stayed pursuant to section 654 in calculating the restitution fine under the formula provided by section 1202.4, subdivision (b)(2)].) in this case, the trial court sentenced thomas to a combination of life and determinate terms. the trial court sentenced thomas to life without the possibility of parole for his felony murder conviction, to life with the possibility of parole for his attempted murder conviction, and two concurrent four-year terms for his burglary and robbery convictions. the trial court imposed consecutive 25-years-to-life terms on enhancements. robbery convictions. if those determinate terms had been properly imposedi.e., if neither sentence had been subject to a section 654 stay, then the trial court properly could have imposed a section 1202.45 parole revocation restitution fine under people v. brasure, supra, 42 cal.4th at page 1075. because, however, we held above that 1202.45 parole revocation restitution fine was improper. (people v. oganesyan, supra, 70 cal.app.4th at p. 1185; people v. pearson, supra, 42 cal.3d at p. 361; people v. cruz, supra, 207 cal.app.4th at pp. 672-673, fn. 8; see people v. hannah, supra, 73 cal.app.4th at pp. 274-275; see also people v. hanson, supra, 23 cal.4th at pp. 361-362; people v. le, supra, 136 cal.app.4th at p. 933.) accordingly, the stayed $280 section 1202.45 parole revocation restitution fine was not properly imposed and is ordered v. thomas argues that his abstract of judgment must be modified to reflect that he was sentenced to life with, not without, the possibility of parole for his attempted murder conviction and to correct the spelling of his middle name. respondent agrees that the 14 abstract of judgment must be modified to reflect a term of life with the possibility of correctly that the record is respondent argues that the trial court should determine the correct spelling middle name when it decides other issues on remand. the sentence for attempted willful, deliberate, and premeditated murder is life with the possibility of parole. ( 664, subd. (a).) in its oral pronouncement of sentence, the trial court correctly sentenced thomas to life with the possibility of parole for his attempted murder convictionconviction. we order the abstract of judgment modified to correct this apparent clerical error. (people v. mitchell (2001) 26 cal.4th 181, 186-187.) thomas contends that his middle name is charged in the information under the middle name and that he stated that respondent argues that thomas has not demonstrated that the abstract of as respondent correctly states, the probation report lists the following aliases, among others, that thomas has used: marlon jarron thomas, marlon jerome thomas, marlon jerrome thomas, marlon jerron thomas, marlon jeron thomas, and marlon jerrone thomas. we agree with respondent that the appeal. the triaremand. 15 disposition ed violation of section 12022.5, subdivision (a), and the matter is remanded for resentencing. abstract of judgment is further ordered modified to strike the $280 parole revocation restitution fine and to reflect that thomas was sentenced to life with the possibility of parole for his attempted murder conviction. in connection with the remand for resentencing on the section 12022.5, subdivision (a) true finding, the trial court is to determine the correct , and his abstract of judgment is ordered modified accordingly. not to be published in the official reports. mosk, j. we concur: turner, p. j. goodman, j. judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
