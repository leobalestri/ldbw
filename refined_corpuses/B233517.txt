( 1382, subd. (a)(2).) when the trial court asked if defendant his attorney, however, was ready to proceed by the next court date. the trial court faretta the prosecutor then sought a three-day time waiver for trial, to accommodate his ome other 60 for trial. on april 7, 2011, the trial court conducted a marsden3 hearing, but denied reason to do so. trial commenced on april 11, 2011. the jury found defendant guilty on all counts and found true all special allegations ( 211, 459, 12022, subd. (b)(1)), and defendant admitted two prior prison terms and a strike conviction ( 667.5, subd. (b), 667, subds. (b)-(i), 1170.12, subds. (a)-(d)). defendant was sentenced to a total of 21 years 8 months in prison. the evidence at trial was as follows. 3 people v. marsden (1970) 2 cal.3d 118 (marsden). 4 1. venetian garden and flowers (counts 3 & 6) on may 30, 2006, at approximately 10:00 a.m., nvard mermeryan and ruzanna lower shop, venetian garden and flowers, on santa monica boulevard in los angeles. defendant walked into the store, wearing cargo pants, a baseball hat, and sunglasses. mermeryan went to the front of the store and asked if defendant needed any help. he inquired about the price of a flower, walked close to mermeryan, and pressed a knife against her stomach. defendant demanded money, so mermeryan walked him to the back of the store toward the cash register and told him to put the knife away so as not to scare begoyan. mermeryan gave defendant $37 from the register. defendant told her he would bring the money back later. he then left the store. mermeryan called the police. defendant never returned the

who robbed her. begoyan also identified defendant from a photographic lineup. according to begoyan, she and mermeryan looked at the photographic lineup together, and mermeryan translated what the police said for begoyan, who speaks armenian. begoyan testified that the poliand that begoyan and mermeryan then initialed next to the photograph. begoyan thought the robber was hispanic because he did not speak armenian. officer james jarvis, who conducted the photographic lineup for mermeryan and begoyan, testified that the lineup was shown to the women separately, and that mermeryan did not translate for begoyan. 2. hair salon, on melrose avenue. she was watching television in the back of the store when defendant entered, wearing a baseball hat and sunglasses. he approached her and told her to give him money. he took a knife out of his pocket and pressed it to her stomach. when melara opened the register, defendant told her to take all the money out 5 happened, but did not immediately call the police. she was scared because defendant told her other people were with him and would keep an eye on her store. she later decided to contact police and identified defendant from a photographic lineup on june 27, who robbed her, except the man in the photo looked a little older and had a beard. she described the robber to police as 5 feet 2 inches tall, 115 pounds, and between 30 and 35 years old. melara described defendant as hispanic because he spoke spanish to her. 3. botanica elegua (counts 4 & 7) on june 5, 2006, at 2:15 p.m., luisa barcelo was working at botanica elegua on melrose avenue. she was conducting a card reading in the back of the store when defendant entered. he was wearing a hat, dark glasses, and a sports jersey. he asked chest and told her to give him money. he followed barcelo to the cash register, holding the knife. when she opened the register, he took about $400 and left. barcelo called police to report the robbery. her store was equipped with video cameras, and she gave a video cassette of the robbery to responding officers, which was played for the jury. she identified defendant from a photographic lineup. she described defendant to police as 5 feet 1 or 2 inches tall, 125 to 130 pounds, and between 30 and 40 years old. 4. all you need party supply (count 1) on june 10, 2006, at approximately 5:05 p.m., mercedes garcia was blowing up balloons at all you need party supply on heliotrope drive. defendant walked in the store wearing a gray shirt and large hawaiian hat. defendant asked some pricing questions and then approached garcia behind the counter, pulling out a knife and placing it to her stomach. garcia was scared and tried to push the knife away. defendant told her he would kill her if she did not stop resisting. he demanded money and took $300 from a metal cash box stored under the counter, which also contained a calling card (that he left $1 on the counter, told garcia he would kill her if she called the police, and left. 6 garcia called police. forensic print specialists were able to lift fingerprints from fingerprints. garcia could not identify defendant in a photographic lineup. 5. tripti market (count 2) on june 10, 2006, at approximately 5:15 p.m., parbati majumdar was working at tripti market on marathon avenue. defendant entered wearing dark glasses, a striped gray shirt, and a hat. he asked about the price of some lotion and then walked behind the took between $300 and $350 and then left. majumdar hit the silent alarm and called police. the store had surveillance equipment which recorded the robbery, and the tape was played for the jury. majumdar was unable to identify defendant in a photographic lineup. 6. on june 11, 2006, los angeles police officer hermilio burdios and his partner officer burdine responded to a burglary call at 1559 winona. based on the reporting located the car and conducted an investigative stop. defendant was the driver and identified himself as mukuch strykanian. a later search of the car revealed two knives, a brown straw hat and gray vertical striped shirt. majumdar identified the hat, shirt, and knife as those used in the robbery. garcia also identified the hat and shirt. defendant was 5 feet 6 inches tall, 160 pounds, and 40 years old at the time of his arrest. all of the crimes were within a few city blocks of each other. discussion defendant contends the trial court improperly denied his faretta motion, reasoning that it was timely made two years before trial, and therefore the trial court lacked discretion to deny it. defendant also contends that the june 10 robberies should not have been tried with the other crimes, because they bolstered weak evidence of the may 30 and june 5 crimes. additionally, defendant contends that testimony concerning fingerprint evidence purportedly gathered at venetian garden was wrongfully admitted. 7 lastly, he complains that even if any of these errors alone is insufficiently prejudicial, the contentions. 1. faretta a defendant has the constitutional right under the sixth and fourteenth amendments to represent himself, and may waive the right to counsel in a criminal case. (faretta, supra, 422 u.s. at p. 819.) if the defendant is mentally competent and within a reasonable time before trial makes an unequivocal request of self-representation, knowingly and intelligently after having been advised by the court of its dangers, the request must be granted. (id. at p. 835; people v. valdez (2004) 32 cal.4th 73, 97-98; people v. welch mandated unconditional right of self-representation, a defendant must assert that right people v. horton (1995) 11 cal.4th 1068, 1110.) a motion not made within a reasonable time prior to trial is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court. (people v. valdez, supra, at p. 102; people v. windham (1977) 19 cal.3d 121, 128, fn. 5.) a motion made immediately before or on the day of trial is generally considered untimely. (see people v. howze (2001) 85 cal.app.4th 1380, 1397; people v. fitzpatrick (1998) 66 cal.app.4th 86, 91, 92.) moreover, court may deny a request for self-representation that is . . . intended to delay or disrupt people v. butler (2009) 47 cal.4th 814, 825.) defendant contends that his july 9, 2009 request was timely, because it was made nearly two years before the case ultimately went to trial in april 2011. however, the trial the time the request was made, the court declared a doubt as to his mental competence and, as a result, all criminal proceedings were suspended, and the court lacked jurisdiction to rule on the motion. (see people v. horton, supra, 11 cal.4th at p. 1108 proceedings were suspended [citation]. thus, the court lacked jurisdiction to rule upon 8 people v. dunkle (2005) 36 cal.4th 861 is misplaced. november 3, 1987, and resumed on may 19, 1988. dunkle made a faretta motion on june 17, 1988, which was denied, and proceedings were again suspended on march 8, 1989. he was again found competent on august 3, 1989, and trial began on october 16, 1989. (dunkle, at pp. 881-882.) the supreme court found that 1988 request to represent himself, made over a year before the commencement of his criminal trial, was timely . . . when he made the request, defendant had just been found id. at pp. 908-909.) notably, dunkle was not incompetent at the time he made his faretta motion, proceedings had not been suspended, and trial was not imminent. in contrast, faretta motion is a nullity because he was not competent at the time he made it, and proceedings were suspended when he made his request for self-representation. (people v. horton, supra, 11 cal.4th at p. 1108; see also people v. stanley (2006) 39 cal.4th 913, 931-932 [the defendant must be mentally competent for his request to represent himself to be made knowingly and intelligently].) before trial, the trial court properly found it to be untimely. in exercising its discretion, efforts to substitute counsel, the reason for the request, the length and stage of the proceedings, and the disruption or delay that might reasonably be expected to follow the granting of such a motion. (people v. jenkins (2000) 22 cal.4th 900, 959; people v. marshall (1996) 13 cal.4th 799, 827.) when the trial court exercises its discretion to deny a motion for self-xamine the total people v. howze, supra, 85 cal.app.4th at pp. 1397-1398.) including proceedings after the purported invocation of the right of self-represits discretion in denying the motion. (people v. marshall (1997) 15 cal.4th 1, 24.) it was 9 clear that defendant was not ready to proceed to trial, and that a continuance would have been necessary. also, the marsden proceedings did not reveal any deficiencies in the good layear, not counting the one year and seven months proceedings were suspended. there were also nearly 20 witnesses scheduled to testify at trial, and a bench warrant had to be issued to secure the presence of begoyan. discretion. furthermore, the record adequately supports an inference that the request was made for the purpose of delay. (people v. butler, supra, 47 cal.4th at p. 825; people v. marshall, supra, 15 cal.4th at p. 25.) two of the three psychological assessments as to and is able to understand the nature of the proceedings, but again chooses not to it is clear that he simply wanted to avoid trial, and that his faretta motion was a means to achieve this goal. (people v. marshall, supra, 15 cal.4th at pp. 25-to give up the right to counsel and represent himself or herself and unequivocally has inference that delay subvert the orderly administration of faretta motion].) 2. consolidation two or more accusatory pleadings may be consolidated for trial when the offenses because consolidation ordinarily p 10 charges, whether in a single accusatory pleading or by consolidation of several accusatory pleadings, ordinarily avoids needless harassment of the defendant and the waste of public funds which may result if the same general facts were to be tried in two or more separate trials [citation], and in several respects separate trials would result in the prevent co people v. ochoa (1998) 19 cal.4th 353, 409, fn. omitted.) whether pleadings are properly consolidated pursuant to section 954 is a question of law and is subject to independent review on appeal. a determination of whether separate proceedings are required in the interests of justice is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. (people v. cunningham (2001) 25 cal.4th 926, 984.) g on a motion to [consolidate] is correct at the time it was made, a reviewing court still must determine whether, in the end, the joinder of counts resulted in gross unfairness people v. gonzales and soliz (2011) 52 cal.4th 254, 281.) the parties agree that the crimes are of the same class, and consolidation of the two accusatory pleadings was proper under section 954. where the statutory criteria for consolidation are present, a defendant may establish error only by clearly showing the trial court abused its discretion alcala v. superior court (2008) 43 cal.4th 1205, 1220.) in deciding whether the trial record before the trial court when it made its ibid.-admissibility of the evidence in separate trials; (2) whether some of the charges are likely to unusually inflame the jury against the defendant; (3) whether a weak case has been joined with a strong case or another weak case so that the total evidence may alter the outcome of some or all of the charges; and (4) whether one of the charges is a capital offense, or the joinder of the chajoinder gives the court broader discretion in ruling on a motion for severance than it has id. at pp. 1220-1221.) 11 first, we will consider if the evidence is cross-admissible. if evidence of one crime would be admissible at a separate trial of the other crime, any potential prejudice from consolidation is ordinarily dispelled. (people v. mckinnon (2011) 52 cal.4th 610, 630.) however, lack of cross-admissibility is not, by itself, sufficient to demonstrate prejudice. (id. at pp. 630-631.) may be admitted to prove motive, intent, identity, or a common design or plan. (evid. code,  1101, subds. (a), (b).) misconduct and the charged offense must share common features that are sufficiently distinctive so as to support the inference that the same person committed both acts. (people v. erving (1998) 63 cal.app.4th 652, 660.) here, it is clear that the may 30, june 5, and june 10 crimes these crimes occurred at small independent businesses, with female proprietors who were pparently working alone). defendant disguised himself with a hat and sunglasses. he used a knife in each crime, and pressed it to the body of his victim. each crime was committed over the course of 10 days, in close proximity to each other. although a disguise and the use of a weapon may be features common to many robberies, the location, time-frame, and characteristics of the stores and proprietors here, as well as the choice of disguise and weapon, are sufficiently distinctive to render the evidence cross-admissible. (see id. at pp. 660-661; see also people v. roldan (2005) 35 cal.4th 646, 706; cf. people v. haston (1968) 69 cal.2d 233, 247-248.) - dence of other crimes may have on the jury. (people v. soper (2009) 45 cal.4th 759, 775.) in making this determination, we consider whether some of the charges are likely to inflame the jury against the defendant. (ibid.) we also consider whether a weak case is joined with a strong case so that the totality of the evidence could have altered the outcome as to some or all of the charges. (ibid.) defendant contends that the evidence of the may 30 and june 5 crimes was weaker, and thus the outcome was 12 likely tainted by consolidation with the june 10 crimes. defendant is mistaken. the evidence supporting the may 30 and june 5 crimes was not appreciably weaker than the june 10 crimes. for the may 30 and june 5 crimes, the witnesses had an ample opportunity to observe defendant, and each witnesses picked him out of a photographic lineup. for the june 10 crimes, neither victim was able to identify defendant in a photographic lineup, although fingerprint evidence linked defendant to one of the crimes, and tnot outweighedand severance is not requiredmerely because properly joined charges might make it more difficult for a defendant to avoid conviction compared with his or her id. at p. 781.) based on the facts before the trial court, we conclude the court did not abuse its discretion and find no basis for asserting a constitutional violation. 3. fingerprint evidence officer jarvis, who investigated the may 30 and june 5 robberies, was asked during direct examination why he included defendant in the photographic lineup he several observations that these three particular robberies all had commonalities . . . defense counsel objected on hearsay grounds. the prosecutor argued that the testimony him toverruled the objection. officer jarvis then went on to testify that the crimes were similar because of their proximity, the use of a knife, and that the suspect wore sunglasses. that she saw defendant touch a box of chocolates inside the store, which the police took as evidence. later in the trial, the prosecution informed the court that the fingerprint analyst who lifted the fingerprints from the chocolates from venetian garden was unavailable to uce the fingerprint card in 13 fingerprints were found at venetian garden and requested an admonishment to the jury. the court concluded that there was no evidence presented at trial that fingerprints had been lifted from the box, and therefore exclusion and an admonishment were unnecessary. hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered for the truth of the matter asserted. (evid. code,  1200.) generally, it is inadmissible, unless it falls into one of the enumerated exceptions to the hearsay rule. ( 1220 et seq.) evidence may be admitted for a nonhearsay purpose if it is relevant to a matter at issue in the case. (people v. turner -of-court statement is properly admitted if a nonhearsay purpose for admitting the statement is identified, and the nonhearsay purpose thus, evidence may be properly admitted for the nonhearsay purpose of proving, for example, why officer jarvis began to investigate defendant for the may 30 and june 5 crimes. jury was not asked to decide why officer jarvis included defendant in the photographic trial. (see people v. marsh people v. lucero (1998) 64 cal.app.4th 1107 is misplaced. in lucero, the trial court permitted a police officer to testify that a witness at the scene of a robbery told him a footprint left at ntroduced to prove the truth of the lucero, at p. 1109.) on ibid.) officer] was offered for a nonhearsay purpose it still had to be relevant to be admissible . . . . the legality of d id. at p. 1109-1110, citation omitted.) lucero here, the testimony was not introduced to show that officer jarvis had probable cause to 14 photographic lineup. even if the evidence was wrongfully admitted, any error was necessarily harmless. a conviction will only be reversed when it is reasonably probable a result more favorable to the defendant would have occurred in the absence of the error. (people v. watson (1956) 46 cal.2d 818, 836.) in this case, ample evidence, including video surveillance ante). 4. cumulative error lastly, defendant contends that even if the above asserted individual errors were not sufficiently prejudicial to warrant reversal, their cumulative effect denied him his federal and state constitutional right to a fair trial. because we have concluded that each disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports grimes, j. we concur: bigelow, p. j. flier, j.
