(id. at pp. 877-878.) allocate a burden of proof. however, . . . applying established principles of statutory construction we believe a petitioner for resentencing under proposition 47 must establish his or her eligibility for such resentencing. in such cases, it is important to keep in mind a person, like sherow, was validly convicted under the law applicable at the time of the trial of the felony offenses. it is a rational allocation of burdens if the petitioner in such cases bears the burden of showing that he or she is eligible for resentencing of what was an otherwise valid sesherow, supra, 239 cal.app.4th at p. 878.) the sherow court rejected the same due process argument process to place the initial burden of proof on him to show eligibility for resentencing. his arguments, however, are directed to principles regarding proof of guilt of an alleged crime. . . . [] the difficulty with a due process argument based on the the initial prosecution for an offense is that the resentencing provisions of proposition 47 deal with persons who have already been proved guilty of their 5 sherow, supra, 239 cal.app.4th at pp. 879-880.) the court n information about the offenses for which sherow [sought] (sherow, supra, 239 cal.app.4th at p. 878.) the or unreasonable. he knows what kind of items he took from the (id. at p. 880.) other decisions are in accord. (see, e.g., people v. rivas-colon (2015) 241 cal.app.4th 444, 448-449 contention that prosecution had burden to establish the value of the property exceeded $950 and that without that proof people v. sweeney (2016) 4 cal.app.5th 295, 302 der proposition 47, the petitioner has the burden to show that he or she is eligible for resentencing. with respect to a theft-related offense, this includes showing that the value of the property was $950 or ; people v. johnson (2016) 1 cal.app.5th 953, 958, 963-965, 969-970 (johnson) [following sherow; petitioning defendant bears initial burden of establishing eligibility; trial court properly ; people v. perkins (2016) 244 cal.app.4th 129, 136-137 (perkins) offender must set out a case for eligibility, stating and in some cases showing the offense of conviction has been reclassified as a misdemeanor and, where the offense of conviction is a theft crime reclassified based on the value of stolen property, showing the value of the property did not exceed $950..) the leading treatise on felony sentencing agrees. (couzens et al., sentencing california crimes (the rutter group 2018petitioner has the burden of establishing eligibility for relief 6 under section 1170.18, including, as to qualified theft crimes, that the loss to the victim did not exceed $950. our supreme court cited sherow and perkins with approval in people v. page (2017) 3 cal.5th 1175 (page). the 1170.18 bears the burden of establishing his or her eligibility, including by providing in the petition a statement of personally id. at p. 1188.) in that vehicle he or she was convicted of taking . . . was worth $950 or ibid.) grundy does not discuss or even acknowledge page. finally, grundy seems to contend he does not know how much money he took from the krispy kreme shop. grundy impossible for appellant to provide in his petition a statement of the value of the property if the value was not personally known to him at the time he filed person who knows how much cash he grabbed from the drawer in the donut shop is grundy. grundy is free to file a petition for resentencing that contains evidence of his eligibility for relief under proposition 47. (see johnson, supra, 1 cal.app.5th at p. 971.) 7 disposition we affimotion to recall the sentence on his felony conviction for second degree commercial burglary and to resentence him under proposition 47. this affirmance is without prejudice to the ion of a petition grundy may file, if he wishes, that offers evidence of his eligibility for the requested relief. not to be published in the official reports egerton, j. we concur: edmon, p. j. dhanidina, j.
