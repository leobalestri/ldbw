(see  17, subd. (b).) 3 proposition 47. on august 10, 2016, the court denied the petition on that ground. in a document dated september 7, 2016, and filed with the trial court on september 19, 2016, woods requested the court guideline[s] stating that my conviction of [section] 472 can be petitioned and reduced to a misdemeanor. the conviction of [section] 472 had no value of stolen item[,] nothing over on september 19, 2016, the trial court issued a minute order for re-sentencing pursuant to prop[osition] 47. [] the ruling of august 10, 2016 woods timely appealed from the august 10, 2016, order. on february 7, 2017, counsel filed a brief pursuant to people v. wende (1979) 25 cal.3d 436 (wende), raising no issues on appeal and requesting that we independently review the record to determine if the lower court committed any error. on june 16, we struck the brief on the ground that the record in the case was not complete, and we could not fulfill our duty to conduct an people v. kelly (2006) 40 cal.4th 106, 119.) on july 19, 2017, we granted a motion by 2017, wende brief. on september 1, 2017, we sent notice to woods of his right to file a supplemental brief within 30 days from that date. he did not file a supplemental brief. proposition 47 reduced to misdemeanors certain drug-related and theft-related offenses that had previously been classified as felonies. (people v. romanowski (2017) 2 cal.5th 903, 907; people v. rivera (2015) 233 cal.app.4th 1089, 1091.) proposition 47 further provided that one who was serving a felony prison sentence 4 ad been in effect at the time the inmate committed his crime, could petition the trial court to recall his sentence and request to be resentenced in accordance with the newly amended version of the statutes. ( 1170.18, subd. (a).) proposition 47 amended several sections of the penal code, including section 473, which defines forgery. ( 1170.18, subd. (a).) forgery relating to a check, bond, s check, travelers check, or money order, where the value of the check, bond, bank bill, s check, or money order does not exceed nine hundred fifty dollars ($950), 473, subd. (b).) either as misdemeanors or felonies. (see  473, subd. (a), 17, subd. (b).) section 472 defines the possession of a or forgery. because possession of a counterfeit seal is not the same as forgery of a check, money order, or other similar instrument, however, the punishment for a to section 473. thus, thiction of that crime is not eligible for recall. furthermore, to the extent that woodstrial court was a motion to reduce his conviction pursuant to the authority to sentence a wobbler offense as a misdemeanor (see people v. tran (2015) 242 cal.app.4th 877, 885-886), the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying the motion. woods presented virtually no evidence or argument to show that felony punishment, and its consequences, are not appropriate for (id. at p. 886.) nothing in our opinion prevents woods from filing another petition for reduction of his sentence at a later date, including upon successful completion of post-release community supervision. (see id. at pp. 891-892.) 5 we have reviewed the matter pursuant to wende, supra, 25 cal.3d 436 and people v. kelly, supra, 40 cal.4th 106, and are satisfied appellate attorney has fully complied with the responsibilities of counsel. we have found no arguable appellate issues and, accordingly, affirm the . disposition the order is affirmed. not to be published. rothschild, p. j. we concur: chaney, j. lui, j.
