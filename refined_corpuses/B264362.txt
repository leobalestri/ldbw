[] [appellant]: yes. [] [prosecutor]: if you 1 two counts of battery and an enhancement of the assault count were dismissed as part of a plea bargain. 2 he met this condition by time served in pretrial custody. 3 are not a citizen of the united states, this plea will cause you to be deported from the country, denied reentry, and denied naturalization as a citizen. do you understand all that? [] goncharuk was sentenced to the low term of 16 months in state prison. during the same hearing, the court asked goncharuk whether he admitted that he nce was to run concurrently with the sentence in case no. ya077019. deportation goncharuk served his time in case nos. na077713 and ya077019. according to the allegations of the petition for a writ of error coram nobis, the next events were as follows: being released, he was taken into immigration custody because the ins calculates that his concurrent 16 months imposed in 2010 as to the 2008 long beach case [na077713], should be added to the 363-day sentence in the 2008 case, to make the 2008 case a deportable offense. a legal resident, goncharuk is currently in custody at the james a. musick f the relief sought by the petition the 2010 admission of a probation violation in the 2008 long beach [na077713] case, ion in na-077713, and vacate the 16- a petition for a writ of coram nobis is the equivalent of a motion to vacate a judgment.people v. griggs (1967) 67 cal.2d 314, 316.) this is a well-established 4 principle.3 thus, if a court grants a petition for a writ of error coram nobis, the order that will issue is an order vacating the judgment. in this case, the petition is seeking: (1) to set aside the admission of a probation violation in case no. na077713; (2) an order deeming the probation violation to have been denied in case no. na077713; and (3) to vacate the sentence imposed in case no. ya077019. the admission of a probation violation is an interlocutory event. an order deeming the probation violation to have been denied is an interlocutory order and is not a final judgment. this is not the occasion for a general discussion of the writ of error coram nobis;4 suffice it to say, as we already have noted, that procedurally this writ is the functional equivalent of motion to vacate a judgment. the power to vacate a judgment does not also empower the court to enter miscellaneous orders that are interlocutory in nature, especially in a case that has been terminated by a final judgment, as is true of case no. na077713. thus, it appears that the relief the petition is seeking vis--vis case no. na077713 is not available under a writ of error coram nobis. however, vacating the judgment in case no. na077713 would have the effect of setting aside the violation of probation. we point out below why there are no grounds to vacate this judgment. the only procedural device for vacating the 16-month sentence imposed in case no. ya077019 is an order vacating the judgment in that case. however, the record is barren of any reason that would justify vacating this judgment. 3 coram nobis is the legal equivalent of a simple the writ of error coram nobis in california (1990) 30 santa clara l.rev. 1, 19.) 4 the early california experience, as well as modern california law, on coram nobis is discussed in prickett, the writ of error coram nobis in california, supra, 30 santa clara l.rev. at pages 7-24. 5 goncharuk that he was a u.s. citizen, was not aware of the fact that the admission of the probation violation in case no. na077713 could have adverse immigration consequences. on appeal, goncharuk points to the fact that in admitting to the probation violation in 2010 in case no. na077713, he was not warned that this admission could have adverse immigration consequences. putting the same point somewhat differently, the fact that goncharuk did not know in 2010 was that the admission of the probation violation would have adverse immigration consequences. errors of fact and law the uniform conclusion of the decisions is that the function of a writ of error coram nobis is to correct an error of fact. it never issues to correct an error of law.(people v. reid because the writ of error coram nobis applies where a fact unknown to the parties and the court existed at the time of judgment that, if known, would have prevented rendition of the judgment, [t]he remedy does not lie to enable the court to correct errors of law.people v. kim (2009) 45 cal.4th 1078, 1093, original italics.) to qualify as the basis for relief on coram nobis, newly discovered facts must establish a basic flaw that would have prevented rendition of the judgment. . . . new facts that would merely have affected the willingness of a litigant to enter a plea, or would have encouraged or convinced him or her to make different strategic choices or seek a different disposition, are not facts that would have prevented rendition of the judgment.people v. kim, supra, 45 cal.4th at p. 1103, italics aunerringly point to in re kirschke (1975) 53 cal.app.3d 405, 414-415, fn. 1, citing in re imbler (1963) 60 cal.2d 554, 570, and in re lindley (1947) 29 cal.2d 709, 723-724.) wrong advice about immigration consequences is not grounds for the issuance of a writ of error coram nobishe facts that [the appellant] allegesthat if he had been 6 adequately advised by his trial counsel as to the immigration consequences he would not have entered the pleawere facts that would have affected his willingness to enter the plea, and would have encouraged or convinced him to make different strategic choices or to seek a different dispositionbut they are not facts that would have prevented rendition of the judgment. (people v. kim, supra, people v. aguilar (2014) 227 cal.app.4th 60, 73.) there are no grounds to vacate the judgments the admitting he violated probation he became susceptible to being deported. however, that goncharuk allegedly did not know he could be deported once he admitted the probation violation, even assuming this to be true,5 would not have prevented the entry of in re kirschke, supra, 53 cal.app.3d 405, 414-415, fn. 1.) thus, this fact may be newly discovered but it simply has no effect on the validity of the judgment in case no. na077713, when that judgment is challenged by a petition for a writ of error coram nobis. goncharuk cites people v. wiedersperg (1975) 44 cal.app.3d 550, also involving the deportation of an alien, as a case where the appellate court found that the allegations of the coram nobis severely criticized in people v. kim, supra, 45 cal.4th at pages 1103-1104. we set forth the background of people v. wiedersperg, as seen by the court in people v. kim, in the margin.6 the supreme court noted that people v. wiedersperg suggested that the alleged 5 he was advised in 2008 and again in 2010, while in the process of admitting the probation violation, that his plea in 2008 and admission of a probation violation in 2010 not understand what he was told is not credible. 6 in arguing to the contrary, defendant relies heavily on people v. wiedersperg [, supra,] 44 cal.app.3d 550, but that decision cannot bear the weight of his argument. in that case, an austrian national was charged with having committed a minor drug 7 error was one of fact and not of law (45 cal.4th at p. 1103) and then went on to state: we disagree. the wiedersperg court never explains why it considered allegations of alienage an error of fact and not of law, nor why such an allegedly unknown fact would have prevented rendition of the judgment. [citation] later courts have found the opinion unpersuasive. as the court of appeal explained in people v. soriano [1987] 194 cal.app.3d [1470] at page 1475, the decision of the wiedersperg court was an extremely limited one. it found only that the trial court to whom the writ was directed had erred in finding it had no jurisdiction to consider the petition, and that [the petitioner] had stated facts which, if they could be proven, would permit issuance of the writ in the discretion of the trial court. (people v. kim, supra, 45 cal.4th at pp. 1103-1104.) we decline to follow people v. wiedersperg. when it comes to the judgment in case no. ya077019, the petition advances no reason or grounds for vacating this judgment. in fact, the only reason to vacate the 16-month sentence is to reduce the time of incarceration for purposes of deportation. that, of course, is not a reason to vacate the judgment under a writ of error coram nobis. in sum, we are faced with two judgments, neither of which is remotely susceptible to a collateral attack under a petition for a writ of error coram nobis. the superior court quite properly denied the petition summarily. the appeal must be dismissed since the petition did not state facts sufficient to invoke the jurisdiction of the superior court, the court was justified in denying the petition summarily. (people v. offense. he submitted the case on the preliminary hearing transcript, was convicted, and served his probation. later, he successfully convinced the trial court to expunge the conviction. he was thereafter deported but filed a petition for a writ of error coram nobis seeking to vacate his conviction on the ground that at the time of his plea no one knew he was an alien. the trial court denied the coram nobis petition on the ground the court lacked jurisdiction because the conviction had already been expunged. [citation.] the appellate court disagreed on the jurisdictional point and remanded, opining that the trial court, in its discretion and if the proof is sufficient, could grant the relief sought.[citation.people v. kim, supra, 45 cal.4th at p. 1103.) 8 shipman (1965) 62 cal.2d 226, 230; in re nunez (1965) 62 cal.2d 234, 236.) an order summarily denying a petition for a writ of error coram nobis is not appealable. (people v. hemphill (1968) 265 cal.app.2d 156, 160.) the foregoing amply justifies a dismissal of this appeal. we note, however, for yzed, was not cognizable under a writ of error coram nobis. this would also have justified a summary denial of the petition. disposition the appeal from the order denying the petition for a writ of error coram nobis is dismissed. not to be published in the official reports. boren, p.j. we concur: ashmann-gerst, j. chavez, j.
