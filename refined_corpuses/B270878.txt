(in re clark (1993) 5 cal.4th 750, 767, fn. 7.) we further stated: court that petitioner has made a prima facie case for relief when should not have been accomplished by way of nunc pro tunc orders. (see in re candelario (1970) 3 cal.3d 702.) instead, the trial court should have conducted a new sentencing hearing with petitioner present and represented by counsel. (see cal. const., art. i  15; pen. code,  977, subd.

[citations.]people v. fedalizo (2016) 246 cal.app.4th 98, 110.) petitioner did not waive such rights 8 when the trial court purported to resentence him nunc pro tunc, nor does he waive such right now. it is incumbent on this court to enforce a invocation of the right to be present at sentencing. further, this reviewing court does not impose sentences in the first instance; that is the task of the trial court. (see, e.g., people v. oates (2004) 32 cal.4th 1048, 1056, 1069 [remand to appellate court for further proceedings consistent with the opinion, including the views expressed in this of firearm enhancement under section 12022.53, subd.
