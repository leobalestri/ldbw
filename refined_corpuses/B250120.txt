(b), (c), & (d).) the court sentenced him to prison for 15 years to life. we affirm. factual summary viewed in accordance with the usual rules on appeal (people v. ochoa (1993) 6 cal.4th 1199, 1206), the evidence established that about 7:30 p.m. on december 29, 2010, 14-year-old taburi watson was shot multiple times and killed near st. andrews park at 87th and st. andrews. a bicycle was nearby in the street. a park employee heard the shots and later saw watson lying on the ground and two people walking southbound on st. andrews. on february 22 and march 29, 2011, los angeles police detectives eric crosson and samuel arnold interviewed creonia ward. ward implicated theron shakir (her former boyfriend), timothy allen (aka lil grape), and appellant in the killing as follows. ward told detectives that shakir, allen, and appellant left her house. she also told detectives that on the night of the shooting, shakir told her the following when the two were later in bed. appellant, shakir, and allen drove to the park. appellant remained in the car while shakir and allen exited and later shot watson, who had been on a bicycle. after the three later went where going to be so hap shot, and appellant, shakir, and allen felt they needed to retaliate. 1 appellant and codefendant theron shakir were jointly tried with separate juries. shakir is not a party to this appeal. 3 faugust 2, 2011 arrest, crosson and arnold interviewed appellant. appellant denied knowledge of any shooting. appellant later told detectives that on the day of the shooting he texted his girlfriend, falsely telling her that he and shakir had been in a shootout by the park. appellant said shakir, allen, and appellant had heard gunshots near the park and drove away. appellant later told detectives that appellant drove shakir and allen near the park. shakir and allen exited the car and appellant waited for them. shakir and allen called about a minute later and appellant picked them up by the park. appellant denied knowing anyone had done anything. appellant later said he heard gunshots after shakir and allen exited the car, but appellant did not see guns and assumed someone had shot at shakir and allen. on august 3, 2011, los angeles police detectives myra kellum and john ferreria interviewed appellant. during the interview, appellant expressed concern crosson and arnold were making appellant look like a ringleader. appellant admitted to kellum and ferreria that appellant crosson and arnold. appellant told kellum and ferreria the following. eight trey members had been suspected of shooting later, on the night of the present offense, appellant, shakir, and allen appellant was driving and receiving directions. shakir and allen had guns, but appellant did not know that when they first drove away. appellant drove to st. andrews park and shakir and allen exited. shakir and allen went through the park, saw someone, and started shooting. appellant said, (sic.) after the shooting, appellant drove shakir and allen [t]hen they told him that i hid some guns for 4 (sic.) appellant told detectives that shakir was saying it was like a favor to 2 issues ry hearing testimony was inadmissible, (2) the trial court erroneously denied his motion to suppress his confession, (3) the trial court erred by giving caljic no. 2.13, and (4) cumulative prejudicial error occurred. discussion 1. ng testimony was admissible. on october 31, 2011, a magistrate conducted the preliminary hearing of appellant and shakir (case no. ba387364).3 during the hearing, the prosecutor asked ward if she told detectives she was afraid to testify. ward indicated she did not want to testify, felt she would incriminate herself, and needed counsel. the magistrate answer was nonresponsive and the magistrate which a privilege may be asserted.magistrate indicated it would not then appoint counsel for ward. later, the prosecutor, standing behind shakir, asked if ward saw the person the prosecutor was standing behind. ward replied she needed a lawyer. the magistrate indicated the question could not incriminate ward. ward later testified the prosecutor 2 a police gang expert y gangster crips (eight trey) were rival gangs. the park was in eight tred watson was an eight trey member. the shooting was called by shakir as a witness, testified that on may 8, 2012, ward told the investigator the following. ward fabricated the story she told police because she was angry with shakir, who cared more about his child from another woman than his child from ward. 3 based on the watson killing, appellant and shakir were held to answer at their first preliminary hearing in case no. ba387364. a new complaint was later filed in case no. ba403335, concerning which appellant and shakir later waived their right to a preliminary hearing. 5 was standing behind shakir. ward denied remembering arnold interviewed her on february 22 and march 29, 2011. the prosecutor asked whether, during those interviews, she was trying to tell the truth. ward later testified she needed a lawyer because she did not want to incriminate herself. the magistrate ward denied remembering whether, on february 22, 2011 (1) she told arnold that shakir told ward that in december 2010, shakir shot a boy riding a bicycle or (2) she told detectives that shakir told ward that shakir went to do that shooting with appellant and lil grape. ward also denied remembering whether, on march 29, 2011 (1) she told arnold that shakir told ward that shakir and others saw a boy riding a bicycle and shot him or (2) she told arnold that in december 2010, shakir told ward that shakir shot that boy with lil grape, and that appellant waited in the car. on january 9, 2013, the trial court conducted a pretrial hearing concerning whether ward could invoke her right against self-incrimination. the prosecutor later posed several questions to ward but ward, represented by counsel, refused to answer them on the ground they might incriminate her. the court suggested the questions were the same ones posed to ward at the preliminary hearing. the court ruled ward could not invoke her right against self-incrimination. later, the court had a sidebar discussion with . after that discussion, the court ruled, based on the representations of during that discussion, -incrimination was valid and she was unavailable as a witness. the trial court ordered sealed the transcript of the sidebar discussion. admitted into evidence at trial. appellant claims preliminary hearing testimony was inadmissible. we conclude otherwise. the claim raises admissibility issues concerning (1) preliminary hearing testimony and (2) february 22 and march 29, 2011 statements, to crosson and arnold, in which she related s to her about the killing (see factual summary). 6 a. . as discussed, ward testified at the preliminary hearing to the effect she did not remember telling detectives that shakir told her that shakir shot watson and appellant was involved in the shooting. there is no dispute said testimony fell within the evidence code section 1291, subdivision (a) former testimony hearsay exception, except to the extent appellant argues the subdivision is inapplicable because ward properly invoked her right against self-hearing. appellant maintains that, as a consequence of that invocation, ward was not a . appelargument is unavailing. the assumption ward properly invoked her right against self-incrimination and right to counsel at the preliminary hearing. however, first, it is settled that the accused has no standing to object to a vioamendment privilege against self-people v. badgett (1995) 10 cal.4th sixth amendment right to counsel. the right to counsel is a personal right [citation], and a violation of that right cannot ordinarily be asserted vicariously.(id. at pp. 343-344.) second, t is settled that denial of a substantial right at the preliminary examination renders the ensuing commitment illegal and entitles a defendant to dismissal people v. pompa-ortiz (1980) 27 cal.3d 519, 523.) accordingly, even if appellant could have raised the issues of the alleged violations at the preliminary hearing of anyoright against self-incrimination and/or right to counsel, the record fails to demonstrate appellant did so by way of a penal code section 995 motion. appellant waived the issues. (cf. in re hannie (1970) 3 cal.3d 520, 528; people v. gibbs (1971) 16 cal.app.3d 758, 765.) 7 moreover, for the reasons discussed below, no violation of those rights occurred.4 we have identified the specific questions concerning which the magistrate concluded ward had not properly invoked her right against self-incrimination. appellant has failed to meet his burden of showing the proffered evidence might have incriminated ward. moreover, it clearly appears the proffered evidence could not possibly have a tendency to incriminate ward. no ight against self-incrimination occurred at the preliminary hearing.5 further, at the preliminary hearing, ward had a right to counsel to advise her concerning her right against self-incrimination only if (1) it appeared she might give incriminating testimony and (2) the magistrate did not advise her concerning her right against self-incrimination. (people v. schroeder (1991) 227 cal.app.3d 784, 788.) those requirements were not met here. preliminary hearing testimony was admissible under the evidence code section 1291, subdivision (a) former testimony hearsay exception. moreover, where, as here, the 4 evidence code section 404 states, be privileged under section 940 [the privilege against self-incrimination], the person claiming the privilege has the burden of showing that the proffered evidence might tend to incriminate him; and the proffered evidence is inadmissible unless it clearly appears to the court that the proffered evidence cannot possibly have a tendency to incriminate the -incrimination] applies only to matter which is put has the tendency to subject the witness to punishment for crime. it cannot do so in advance of an actual question being put. it is the court, not the individual, that must mpeople v. apodaca a compelled witness does not arise until he or she answers or refuses to answer a specific id. at p. 1715.) we independently review whether a witness could properly invoke the privilege. (people v. seijas (2005) 36 cal.4th 291, 304.) 5 as noted, the nonconfidential record in this case reflects the trial court, based on information not presented to the magistrate, ruled ward could validly invoke her right against self-incrimination. the differing rulings by the magistrate and trial court on this issue are therefore of no significance. we have reviewed the sealed transcript of the -incrimination was valid. 8 requirements of evidence code section 1291 were met, admission of the testimony did not violate apto confrontation. (people v. herrera (2010) 49 cal.4th 613, 621.) b. , and , were admissible under the inconsistent statement hearsay exception. ward made statements to detectives about statements shakir made to her about the killing. there is no dispute statements of shakir to ward, fell within the evidence code section 1235 inconsistent statement hearsay exception, except to the extent appellant argues the subdivision is inapplicable because ward properly invoked her right against self-incrimination and right 6 appellant maintains that, as a consequence of that invocation the meaning of evidence code section 1235 and (2) there was no compliance with evidence code section 770, subdivision (a). standing to object to the a-incrimination or right to counsel, and appellant failed to raise the issues in a penal code section 995 against self-incrimination, detectives 6 self-he people statement from shakir, or her giving any statement to police. this testimony was impeachedcession inconsistent with her preliminary hearing testimony. 9 about the killing were admissible under the evidence code section 1235 inconsistent statement hearsay exception.7 c. under the declaration against interest hearsay exception. shakir made statements to ward about the killing (and ward related them to detectives). appellant argues were inadmissible hearsay violative of his right to confrontation. we disagadmissible under the evidence code section 1230 declaration against interest hearsay exception. section 1230 [the declarant] to the risk of . . . criminal liability, . . . that a reasonable man in his position would not have made the statement unle that the declarant is unavailable, that the declaration was interest when made and that the declaration was sufficiently reliable to warrant admission people v. duarte (2000) 24 cal.4th 603, 610-611.) s california courts have held, a declaration against interest may be admitted in a joint trial so long as the statement satisfies the statutory definition and otherwise satisfies the constitutional requirement of trustworthiness.people v. arceo (2011) 7 appellant makes the related claim the trial court erred by using caljic no. 2.13 to instruct the jury that remembers a certain event, that testimony is inconsistent with a prior statement or at most a desire on her part not to incriminate herself, and no one explained to the jury her invocation of her right against self-incrimination. the claim is unavailing because appellant failed to request clarifying or amplifying language for the instruction. (cf. people v. palmer (2005) 133 cal.app.4th 1141, 1156.) we reject the argument on -incrimination occurred. no admiclause, we reject the claim because he raised that issue (as distinct from the issue of st time in his reply brief. (cf. people v. thomas (1995) 38 cal.app.4th 1331, 1334 (thomas); people v. jackson (1981) 121 cal.app.3d 862, 873 (jackson).) 10 195 cal.app.4th 556, 575 (arceo).) there is no dispute shakir was unavailable as a witness. if the declaration against interest hearsay exception otherwise applies to a statement, the fact the statement also inculpates a nondeclarant, including a defendant, does not render the exception inapplicable. (people v. tran (2013) 215 cal.app.4th 1207, 1218-whether the exception applies. (people v. gordon (1990) 50 cal.3d 1223, 1250-1251.) we previously set forth sha (see factual summary). thtold ward while the two were in bed that shakir and allen shot watson, and shakir implicated appellant in the shooting. shakir essentially told ward he was a direct perpetrator in the murder of watson. subjected him to criminal liability and was against his penal interest. (arceo, supra, 195 cal.app.4th at p. 576.) moreover, shakir purported to speak from personal knowledge. he did not, in his statement to ward, minimize his involvement or shift the blame to appellant; if anything, shakir made his statements, not to police when he was in custody, but to ward, his girlfriend, in bed. the most reliable circumstance, one in which the conversation occurs between friends in a noncoercive setting that fosters uninhibited disclosures. (arceo, supra, 195 cal.app.4th at p. 578.) further, ttrey gangs were rivals. shakir and allen were members of the former gang and watson was a member of the latter; therefore, shakir and allen had a motive to shoot and kill watson. there was evidence the killing was in retaliation for the shooting of to ward was sufficiently reliable and satisfied the constitutional requirement of trustworthiness, and his statement was admissible under the declaration against interest hearsay exception. (arceo, supra, 195 cal.app.4th 556, 575-578.) 11 was inadmissible under the bruton/aranda rule. (people v. aranda (1965) 63 cal.2d 518 (aranda); bruton v. united states (1968) 391 u.s. 123 [20 l.ed.2d 476] (bruton).) under that rule, the admission into evidence, incriminates, and is inadmissible hearsay as to, a defendant confrontation when the confession is admitted into evidence at their joint jury trial. (people v. fletcher (1996) 13 cal.4th 451, 455-456; aranda, supra, 63 cal.2d at pp. 528-531; bruton, supra, 391 u.s. at pp. 124-136 & fn. 3.) we note appellant and shakir were tried togeth even if the rule might statements to ward, his girlfriend, were nontestimonial and thus did not violate the bruton/aranda (cf. people v. gutierrez (2009) 45 cal.4th 789, 812-813; arceo, supra, 195 cal.app.4th at pp. 571, 574-575.) the bruton/aranda rule is also inapplicable becawas not inadmissible hearsay as to appellant; as discussed, both the inconsistent statement to ward. (cf. arceo, supra, 195 cal.app.4th at pp. 571-572 & fn. 6, 575.) related statement to detectives. (see fn. 7, antetestimonial, we reject the claim because he made it for the first time in his reply brief. (cf. thomas, supra, 38 cal.app.4th at p. 1334; jackson, supra, 121 cal.app.3d at p. 873.) finally, appellant made incriminating statements (which appellant characterizes as a confession) to kellum and ferreria about the watson killing. ward testified that , and appellant, shakir, and allen felt they needed to retaliate. after the shooting of watson, appellant told ward, . any erroneous admission into evidence of the detectives 12 relating what shakir said about the killing, was harmless under any conceivable standard. (cf. people v. watson (1956) 46 cal.2d 818, 836; chapman v. california (1967) 386 u.s. 18, 24 [17 l.ed.2d 705].) 2. crosson and arnold reflects as follows. crosson advised appellant of his miranda8 rights and appellant indicated he understood them. appellant subsequently indicated he wanted to talk with crosson, appellant waived his miranda rights, and appellant said he had nothing to hide from the detectives. appellant later made a statement to crosson and arnold and, on august 3, 2011, appellant made another recorded, transcribed statement to kellum and ferreria. kellum and ferreria began taking the august 3, 2011 statement at 4:00 a.m. on or before january 4, 2013, appellant made a pretrial motion alleging his miranda rights had been violated in connection with the above statements. during a hearing on that date, the court indicated it had read the above transcripts. the court found as follows. appellant waived his miranda rights after the first interview and never subsequently invoked them. appellant, not the detectives, sought to resume the interview, and appellant sought this to set the record straight that he was not the ringleader and to protect himself concerning his level of involvement in the incident. no miranda violation occurred. appellant subsequently indicated to the court that, during booking, kellum and ferreria made unrecorded promises to appellant and appellant should have been mirandized prior to his second statement. the court then heard testimony from kellum concerning whether kellum and ferreria had made promises to appellant. testimony established the following. detectives asked kellum to book appellant. kellum knew nothing about the case at that time. kellum and ferreria took appellant to the station basement for booking. it took perhaps a minute to go to the basement. the booking process took perhaps 20 to 30 minutes. 8 miranda v. arizona (1966) 384 u.s. 436 [16 l.ed.2d 694]. 13 while kellum and ferreria were booking appellant, appellant said he wanted to talk to them about his case. after booking, kellum and ferreria conducted the second interview of appellant at the station and made no promises of leniency. the trial court concluded no promises of benefit were made to appellant. the court denied reflected in the factual summary. mirandain [of miranda rights] is unnecessary where and intelligent waiver. [citations.] the courts examine the totality of the circumstances, including the amount of time that has passed since the waiver, any change in the identity of the interrogator or the location of the interview, any official reminder of the prior any indicia that he subjectipeople v. pearson (2012) 53 cal.4th 306, 316-317 (pearson).) on august 2, 2011, before his first statement, appellant understood and waived his miranda rights. appellant concedes he waived them. appellant never subsequently invoked them. given at the station, he initiated the interview leading to his second statement given at the station. the second statement occurred within about 30 minutes of the first. we holmiranda rights prior to the second statement was unnecessary and his second statement was voluntary. (cf. people v. hensley (2014) 59 cal.4th 788, 815; see people v. mickey (1991) 54 cal.3d 612, 647; in re aven s.
