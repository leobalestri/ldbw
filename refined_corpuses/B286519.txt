(people v. race (2017) 18 cal.app.5th 211, 217; people v. delarosarauda (2014) 227 cal.app.4th 205, 210.) at defendant has been convicted of a crime involving domestic violence as defined in section 13700 or in section 6211 of the family code, a violation of section 261, 261.5, or 262, or any crime that requires the defendant to register pursuant to subdivision (c) of section 290, the court, at the time of sentencing, 5 shall consider issuing an order restraining the defendant from any contact with the victim. the order may be valid for up to 10 2 thus, section 136.2[, subdivision (i)(1)] authorizes a postconviction restraining order people v. beckemeyer (2015) 238 cal.app.4th 461, 466.) defendant was not convicted of any of the enumerated crimes in section 136.2, subdivision (i)(1) as against a.f. defendant was not charged with or convicted of violating sections 261 (rape), 261.5 (unlawful sexual intercourse with a person under 18), or 262 (spousal rape). nor was he charged with a crime that required him to register as a sex offender pursuant to section 290, subdivision (c). thus, section 136.2 did not permit the issuance of a protective order in favor of a.f. unless as defined in section 13700 or in section 6211 of the family committed against a person cohabitant, former cohabitant, or person with whom the suspect has had a child or is having or has had a dating or engagement ; see also fam. code,  6211 [domestic violence is abuse against spouse, former spouse, cohabitant, former cohabitant, person with whom suspect has had a child, person with whom suspect has dating or engagement consanguinity .) while 2 section 136.2 was subsequently amended (stats. 2017, ch. 270,  1; stats. 2018, ch.805,  1), but the amendments do not affect the issue here. 6 defendant was convicted of committing a crime of abuse against a.f., there was no evidence that a.f. and defendant were in any of the relationships enumerated above. thus, defendant was not a.f., and section 136.2, subdivision (i)(1) does not support the issuance of the protective order here.3 we content or format of the judicial council form that determines the propriety of the challenged protective order, but the authorizing statute.people v. robertson (2012) 208 cal.app.4th 965, 996.) the attorney general has not identified any other statute that would provide a basis for the trial court to issue the order protecting a.f. in this case. the trial court thus erred by issuing the protective order. accordingly, we will strike the protective order and otherwise affirm the judgment as modified. 3 we need not decide whether the court could have issued a criminal protective order in favor of t.p. because the trial court expressly terminated an earlier protective order that listed t.p. as the protected person. 7 iv. disposition the judgment is modified by striking the november 20, 2017 protective order. as so modified, the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports kim, j. we concur: baker, acting p.j. seigle, j. judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
