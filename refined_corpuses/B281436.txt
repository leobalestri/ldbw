filed 10/25/18 p. v. firestone-kelly ca2/4 not to be published in the official reports california rules of court, rule 8.1115(a), prohibits courts and parties from citing or relying on opinions not certified for publication or ordered published, except as specified by rule 8.1115(b). this opinion has not been certified for publication or ordered published for purposes of rule 8.1115. in the court of appeal of the state of california second appellate district division four the people, plaintiff and respondent, v. john p. firestone-kelly, defendant and appellant. b281436 (los angeles county super. ct. no. sa093600) appeal from a judgment of the superior court of los angeles county, laura f. priver, judge. dismissed. edward mahler, under appointment by the court of appeal, for defendant and appellant. xavier becerra, attorney general, gerald a. engler, chief assistant attorney general, lance e. winters, assistant attorney general, paul m. roadarmel, jr. and tita nguyen, deputy attorneys general, for plaintiff and respondent. 2 introduction this case presents a challenging question: where the parties agree there was a prejudicial error below, and the trial court acted in excess of its jurisdiction by entering judgment, must this court nonetheless dismiss the appeal because the defendant has not obtained a certificate of probable cause required by penal code section 1237.5?1 during pretrial proceedings, the trial court declared a doubt as to the competency of defendant john firestone-kelly, and suspended all proceedings under section 1368, subdivision (c). competency and suspended proceedings, the trial court is required to hold a competency hearing; this requirement may not be waived. any further proceedings, other than a competency no competency hearing was held. rather, at the next hearing, trial counsel purported to waive the requirements of section 1368, defendant pled no contest, and judgment was entered. defendant, representing himself, later filed a notice of appeal and request for certificate of probable cause under section 1237.5; he did not mention the section 1368 error. the court certificate of probable cause. on appeal, the attorney general concedes that the trial court erred by failing to hold a competency hearing, and that as a result the court acted in excess of its jurisdiction by proceeding with the conviction and sentencing. however, the attorney general asserts that because the court retained fundamental jurisdiction, the conviction is voidable rather than void, and lack 1all further statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise indicated. 3 of a certificate of probable cause mandates dismissal. defendant asserts that because it is clear that the court violated his due process rights by failing to hold a competency hearing, no certificate is required. thus, this case presents a conflict: on the one hand, court fails to hold one, the judgment m (people v. welch (1999) 20 cal.4th 701, 738.) on the other hand, section 1237.5 dictates that a challenge to the validity of a plea cannot be addressed without a certificate of probable cause, requiring the appeal to be dismissed. we find that section 1237.5, and the case law interpreting it, leave no room for exceptions to the certificate requirement. the appeal is therefore dismissed. factual and procedural background at the preliminary hearing, irma h.2 testified that she was workiging center in june 2016. she saw defendant outside smoking a cigarette, and he walked into the building after a patient. defendant was carrying a metal water container, and he went toward the water cooler; irma asked if she could help him. defendant started yelling, cursing, and threatening to kill irma. expression on his face. irma pressed the panic button, which set off a silent alarm. defendant told irma he knew what she was doing, and said, i then defendant left. officer was advised the defendant was attempting to punch 2we refer to the victim by her first name to protect her privacy. (see cal. rules of court, rule 8.90(b)(4).) 4 several bystanders for no apparent reason. the officer turned and observed the defendant. the officer asked the defendant why he was swinging at people. the defendant stated he was shadow the los angeles county district attorney (the people) filed an information charging defendant with felony criminal threats for the incident involving irma ( 422, subd. (a), count 1), and misdemeanor assault on a john doe for the punching incident ( 240, count 2). on september 7, 2016, defendant pled not guilty. at a hearing on october 18, 2016, defendant requested new counsel, and the court held a hearing pursuant to people v. marsden (1970) 2 cal.3d 118 (marsden). the court denied defendan on the date set for trial, november 3, 2016, defendant again requested new counsel. the court held another marsden hearing. following the marsden hearing, defense counsel expressed a doubt about defendacompetence to stand trial pursuant to section 1368.3 the court asked the prosecutor whether he had any information as to happened during the course of this alleged crime that might the prosecutor responded, the court declared doubt, had defendant 3section 1368, discussed more fully below, allows the trial court or counsel to express on the record a doubt as to a sections 1368 and 1369 require certain procedures to be followed once such a doubt has been expressed. 5 removed from the courtroom because he was interrupting the proceedings, and suspended the proceedings pursuant to section 1368. the court set a hearing on december 8, 2016 for further proceedings under section 1368 in a different courtroom, and at the hearing on december 8, 2016, which was held before a different judge, the attorneys stated their appearances and the the prosecutor said that section 245, subdivision (a)(4), and he would serve a two-year sentence. defense counsel replied, the people moved to amend the information, and the court granted the motion to add count 3. defendant expressed that he understood his rights, and pled no contest. the court accepted the plea, sentenced defendant to two years in state prison, and imposed various fines and fees. the court asked d] reading of the appellate rights at defense counsel answered yes. on january 20, 2017, the court received a rambling, four-page handwritten letter from defendant requesting assistance in appealing from the plea and conviction. in the letter defendant acknowledged the felony and misdemeanor charges, stating that there was one case for assault and another for threats, and court to another. defendant wroteappeal is filed over the felony assault plea agreement and/or connect me with the proper judge or offices to have an appeal/revoke plea agreement done. the court noted that it received the letter, and prepared a minute order stating in part, 6 if the defendant wants to appeal, the defendant must file the appropriate documents on january 31, 2017, defendant, in pro per, filed a notice of appeal. defendant also filed a request for a certificate of probable cause, which did not address the competency issue. the court denied the request. discussion defendant asserted in his opening brief that the trial court erred when, after the first court suspended proceedings under section 1368, the second court failed to conduct the required competency hearing and instead reinstated criminal proceedings. defendant asserted that section 1237.5 barred a challenge to the validity of his plea, so he was challenging only his sentence. however, defendantbriefs focused on the argument that the trial court violated his due process rights by accepting his plea and entering a judgment. the people, represented by the attorney general, asserted that the appeal must be dismissed because defendant did not obtain a certificate of probable cause. we requested further briefing from the parties as to rendered the subsequent court proceedings void, and if so, whether a certificate of probable cause was required under the circumstances. both parties submitted supplemental letter briefs.4 in his supplemental briefing, the parties modified their 4 this court was very specific in defining the issues to be court acted in excess of its and entering judgment, and what effect that had on the requirement for a certificate of probable cause. for reasons brief instead argued that defendant was entitled to the assistance 7 arguments somewhat; defendant stated that he was in fact challenging the validity of his plea, and the attorney general conceded that failure to hold a competency hearing was error, jurisdiction. legal, such as when it implicates constitutional rights and the exercise of judgment about the values underlying legal principles, (in re taylor (2015) 60 cal.4th 1019, 1035.) we find that because defendant is challenging the validity of his plea, but he failed to obtain a certificate of probable cause as required by section 1237.5, the appeal must be dismissed. a. the trial court was required to hold a competency hearing stand trial (cooper v. oklahoma (1996) 517 u.s. 348, 369.) t has long been accepted that a person whose mental condition is such that he lacks the capacity to understand the nature and object of the proceedings against him, to consult with counsel, and to assist in preparing his defense (drope v. missouri (1975) 420 u.s. 162, 171.) a finding that a defendant is competent to stand trial is also necessary before a defendant may be permitted to plead guilty. (godinez v. moran (1993) 509 u.s. 389, 400.) thus, of counsel when preparing his notice of appeal. this was not an issue we requested to be briefed, and our specific request was not an invitation to assert new legal theories not addressed in the this issue. (see people v. malik (2017) 16 cal.app.5th 587, 595 [issues not raised in the opening brief are forfeited].) 8 the united states constitution and state law prohibit the state from trying or convicting a criminal defendant while he or she is mentall (people v. rogers (2006) 39 cal.4th 826, 846.) california has codified this mandate in section 1367, which mental disorder or developmental disability, the defendant is unable to understand the nature of the criminal proceedings or to ( 1367, subd.

[citations.] the objective is to promote judicial economy. . . . (people v. panizzon (1996) 13 cal.4th 68, 75.) a guilty plea admits every element of the charged offense and constitutes a conviction [citations], and consequently issues that concern the determination of guilt or innocence are not cognizable. [citations.] instead, appellate review is limited to issues that jurisdiction of the court or the legality of the proceedings, including the constitutional validity of the plea. (in re chavez (2003) 30 cal.4th 643, 649.) the attorney general compares this case to mendez, supra, 19 cal.4th 1084, arguing that the supreme court in that case made clear that appellate challenges regardcompetence in the trial court require a certificate of probable cause. in mendez, the trial mental competence twice, and both times had him committed to a mental hospital for evaluation and treatment. after each determined that the defendant was competent, and the trial court held that the defendant had recovered mental competence and reinstated the criminal proceedings. (id. at pp. 1089-1090.) after the second reinstatement, the defendant pled guilty pursuant to a 18 plea deal. (id. at pp. 1090-1091.) the defendant filed a notice of appeal, but did not indicate that he intended to appeal any grounds requiring a certificate of probable cause, and the court did not issue a certificate of probable cause. (id. at p. 1091.) later, citing issues with mental competence, the defendant sought and received a certificate of probable cause, but it was obtained outside the timeframe allowed by statute and court rules. (id. at pp. 1091-1092.) failure to obtain a timely certificate of probable cause, and the defendant challenged that finding in the supreme court. the supreme court framed the question as follows: order to obtain review of certificate issues, must a defendant who has pleaded guilty or nolo contendere to a charge in the superior court, and who seeks to take an appeal from a judgment of conviction entered thereon, have complied with section 1237.5 and rule 31(d), first paragraph, fully, and, specifically, in a timely fashion5 (mendez, supra, 19 cal.4th at p. 1093.) the court 5at the time mendez was decided, the first paragraph of california rules of court, rule 31conviction is entered upon a plea of guilty or nolo contendere [in the superior court], the defendant shall, within 60 days after the judgment is rendered, file as an intended notice of appeal the statement required by section 1237.5. . .; but the appeal shall not be operative unless the trial court executes and files the certificate of probable cause required by that section. within 20 days after the defendant files the statement the trial court shall execute and file either a certificate of probable cause or an order denying a certificate and shall forthwith notify the parties of the mendez, supra, 19 cal.4th at p. 1088 fn. 2.) similar provisions are now in california rules of court, rule 8.304(b). 19 incompetence issues are indeed certificate issues, inasmuch as they are questions going to the legality of the proceedings, and, (id. at p. 1100.) the should be applied in a strict manner. in enacting section 1237.5, the legislature . . . established a mechanism that did not invite (id. at p. 1098.) because the defendant did not obtain a timely certificate of probable cause in compliance with the applicable rules, the supreme court held that the appeal challenging any competence issues in the trial court must be dismissed. the attorney general correctly points out that california authority universally holds that in the absence of a certificate of probable cause, the validity of a guilty or no contest plea cannot be challenged. court to hear the merits of issues going to the validity of the plea unless the defendant has obtained a certificate of probable cause, or has sought and obtained relief from default in the reviewing (people v. panizzon, supra, 13 cal.4th 68, 75; see also people v. shelton (2006) 37 cal.4th 759, 766 [o a negotiated sentence imposed as part of a plea bargain is properly laims regarding the illegality of the judgment, whether on jurisdictional or other grounds, are precisely the types of claims which are covered by section 1237.5 and require a certificate of probable (people v. jones (1995) 33 cal.app.4th 1087, 1092.) here, by asserting that the trial court did not have the authority to enter judgment against defendant because it failed to hold a 20 competency hearing, defendant is challenging the legality of the judgment, which typically requires a certificate of probable cause. c. the due process error is not cognizable on appeal due to the lack of a certificate of probable cause the difficulty with this case is that on the one hand, the parties agree on the existence of a clear due process error that is ,but on the other hand, section 1237.5 does not allow defendant to challenge it because the court denied his request for a certificate of probable cause. we hold that section 1237.5 and the case law interpreting it do not allow for exceptions to the requirement that a defendant must obtain a certificate of probable cause. the attorney general asserts that although the trial lack fundamental jurisdiction, and as a result the judgment is voidable, but not void. because the judgment is voidable, the attorney general argues, the lack of a certificate of probable cause bars the appeal. indeed, [t]he erroneous acceptance of a plea bargain is only an act in excess of jurisdiction and hence is not void for want of fundamental jurisdiction. (people v. webb, supra, 186 cal.app.3d at pp. 411-412.) a certificate of probable cause is required when a defendant pleads guilty and thereafter jurisdictional, or other grounds going to the legality of the ( 1237.5, subd.

(id. at p. 1092-1093.) the court of appeal held that a certificate of probable cause was required nonetheless: impossible to commit the charged crime against the overaged victim, the trial court acted in excess of its jurisdiction when it imposed sentence for that crime.
