(pen. code,  1170.18, subd. (a)). although preciado did not check the box alleging that the property at issue in his conviction was worth less than $951, he 3 a joyride, [vehicle code section] 10851[, subdivision (a)]. taking or driving a vehicle. discussion 1. proposition 47 proposition 47 reduces certain drug and theft-related offenses to misdemeanors, unless a defendant is otherwise ineligible. (pen. code,  1170.18, subds. (a)-(c).) had previously been designated as either felonies or wobblers (crimes people v. rivera (2015) 233 cal.app.4th 1085, 1091.) under penal code section 1170.18, an individual who was previously convicted of a qualifying felony may petition the trial court to have that conviction reduced to a misdemeanor. (id. at p. 1092.) a petitioner who satisfies the criteria in section 1170.18 shall have his sentence recalled and be resentenced to a misdemeanor unless the court, in its discretion, determines that resentencing the petitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. (pen. code,  1170.18, subd. (b).) where, as here, a questions of statutory interpretation, we review that ruling de novo. (see people v. sherow (2015) 239 cal.app.4th 875, 878 (sherow 2. vehicle code section 10851 is not a qualifying theft offense under proposition 47 preciado contends penal code section 490.2, which was added by proposition 47 and which the property taken does not exceed $950 to a misdemeanor, applies to violations of vehicle code section 10851, subdivision (a), where the vehicle is taken by means of theft.1 spe 1 penal code section 490.2 reclassifies as petty theft a class of crimes that, prior to were considered grand theft, and it reduces the punishment 4 support his reading of penal code section 490.2. preciado argues the trial court erred in denying his resentencing petition because he committed a theft when violating vehicle code section 10851, subdivision (a). we recently rejected the same arguments in people v. solis (2016) 245 cal.app.4th 1099 (solis). in solis, we held that a violation of vehicle code section 10851, even if committed by means of theft, does not qualify for reduction of sentence under penal code section 490.2. (solis, supra, 245 cal.app.4th at pp. 1109-1114.) applying principles of statutory construction, we determined california voters intended to exclude all violations of vehicle code section 10851 from the scope of penal code section 490.2. (ibid.) first, applying looked to the language of penal by proposition 47. (solis, supra, 245 cal.app.4th at pp. 1110-1111.) in listing eligible predicate offenses for petty theft with a prior, penal code section 666 now distinguishes between petty theft, grand theft, and auto theft under vehicle code section 10851. (id. at p. 1110.) we concluded that auto theft under vehicle code section 10851 as a predicate offense that is distinct from both petty theft and grand theft demonstrates that the voters viewed auto theft under vehicle code section 10851 as a different type of theft. (id. at pp. 1110-1111.) thus, the voters did not intend for felony violations of vehicle code section 10851 to be reducible to misdemeanors under penal code section 490.2. (ibid.) for those crimes to a misdemeanor. the statute provides in relevant part: obtaining any property by theft where the value of the money, labor, real or personal property taken does not exceed nine hundred fifty dollars ($950) shall be considered petty theft and shall be punished as a misdemeanor, except that such person may instead be punished pursuant to subdivision (h) of section 1170 if that person has one or more prior convictions for an offense specified in clause (iv) of subparagraph (c) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (e) of section 667 or for an offense requiring registration code,  490.2, subd. (a).) 5 second, we compared vehicle code section 10851 to penal code section 484, the statute generally defining theft. (solis, supra, 245 cal.app.4th at pp. 1111-1112.) we recognized vehicle code section 10851 defines a more specific set of crimes than does penal code section 484, particularly those involving the unlawful taking and driving of vehicles. (ibid.) we also observed that the vehicle code is designed to address issues distinct from those addressed by the penal code, specifically issues of safety of public highways, the regulation of tow trucks, car insurance, and the recovery of stolen vehicles. (ibid.) because vehicle code section 10851 targets a more specific form of theft than what is addressed by penal code section 484, and because it does so with purposes distinct from the theft provisions included in the penal code, we concluded that the voters did not intend to make vehicle code section 10851 a reducible offense under penal code section 490.2. (ibid.) had the voters intended to do so, they would have made their intent explicit in enacting proposition 47. (ibid.) third, we rejected the argument that the voters intended to make vehicle code section 10851 a reducible offense under penal code section 490.2 because it is a lesser-included offense of penal code section 487, subdivision (d)(1), commonly le offense under penal code section 490.2. (solis, supra, 245 cal.app.4th at pp. 1112-1113.) we observed that a lesser-included offense may, in some instances, be a more serious crime than the greater offense, and, as a result, the legislature may decide to punish the lesser-included offense more severely. (ibid.) accordingly, the fact that vehicle code section 10851 is a lesser-included offense of penal code section 487 does not demonstrate that the voters intended to make vehicle code section 10851 a reducible offense under proposition 47. (ibid.) preciado does not offer any arguments that were not considered and addressed in solis. accordingly, for the same reasons expressed in solis, we conclude the trial court vehicle code section 10851 is not reducible to a misdemeanor under proposition 47. we therefore do 6 not need to reach the issue of whether preciado met his burden of showing that the value of the stolen property was less than $951. disposition the trial courorder denying p is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports lavin, j. we concur: edmon, p. j. hogue, j.* * judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
