(people v. deshon young (july 27, 2006, b183869, at p. 2) [nonpub. opn.].) law enforcement subsequently executed a search warrant in connection with these shootings on an apartment where young was staying. (ibid.) young was in his bedroom when swat stormed the apartment. after law enforcement arrested young, they searched his room and found a gun on his bed, under the covers. a jury convicted young of possessing a firearm as a felon in violation of section 12021, subdivision (a)(1). young filed a petition in propria persona for recall of his sentence in 2012, but the court denied the petition without prejudice for lack of service on the district attorney. on september 19, 2013, young refiled his petition for recall with the assistance of counsel. after a hearing, the court with prejudice under section 1170.126, subdivision (e)(2), s 667, subdivision (e)(2)(c)(iii) and 1170.12, subdivision (c)(2)(c)(iii). young appealed. discussion on appeal, young argues that the voters did not intend, and section 1170.126 is not actually written, to deny as here, arming is an element of the offense. young ccur during a separate offense. 1 undesignated statutory references are to the penal code. 3 a body of case law refutes these arguments. (see people v. brimmer (2014) 230 cal.app.4th 782, 805806; people v. elder (2014) 227 cal.app.4th 1308, 1312; see also people v. white (2016) 243 cal.app.4th 1354, 13611362; people v. hicks (2014) 231 cal.app.4th 275, 283284; people v. osuna (2014) 225 cal.app.4th 1020, 1035; people v. white (2014) 223 cal.app.4th 512, 519.) nlike section 12022, which requires that in a felony for additional punishment to be imposed (italics added), the [section here] disqualifies an inmate from eligibility for lesser punishment if he or she was armed with a firearm during the commission of the current offense (italics added). during is variously defined as throughout the at some point in the course of. s 3d new internat. dict. (1986) p. 703.) in other words, it requires a temporal nexus between the arming and the underlying felony, not a facilitative oneosuna, at p. 1032.) without a facilitative nexus requirement, the court did not need to find an additional separate ; it was enough, considering the temporal element only, that the arming occurred during the possession. felon in possession of a firearm is not automatically disqualified from resentencing by virtue of that conviction[, however]; such a person is disqualified only if he or she had the firearm available for offensive or defensive use.people v. blakely (2014) 225 cal.app.4th 1042, 1048 (blakely); accord, people v. estrada (2015) 243 cal.app.4th 336, 342; people v. burnes (2015) 242 cal.app.4th 1452, 1458.) ,however, that the defendant actually physically possessed the weapon by submitting eyewitness testimony placing the weapon in the to prove availability.

[t]he threat presented by a firearm increases in direct proportion to its accessibility. obviously, a firearm that is available for use as a weapon creates the very real danger i (people v. mendival (1992) 2 cal.app.4th 562, 573.)blakely, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1057.) the can and does apply to section 12021 possession offenses, and the trial court properly applied it here. disposition the order is affirmed. not to be published. lui, j. we concur: rothschild, p. j. chaney, j.
