(a)(1))1 and admitted a prison prior on 1all further statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise indicated. 3 may 26, 2015. on june 2, 2015, pursuant to appellan plea agreement, the trial court imposed a sentence of five years but suspended its execution and placed appellant on five years of formal probation. appellant admitted that he violated his probation by failing to obey all laws. the court revoked and immediately reinstated modifications, including a requirement that appellansuccessfully complete a 180-day live-in program the court conditionally approved the blueprint recovery program in palmdale and ordered appellant not to leave the program prior to successful completion or until authorized to do so by the program director, his probation officer, or the court. the court further ordered appellant to promptly report to the court if he left the program prior to completion. in addition to agreeing to attend the treatment program, appellant agreed to waive custody credits he had earned to that point. he and the court had the following exchange: the court: time, for a total of 553 days. [] what i . . . mean by that, if you got sent to state prison, you would have credit for that. it would be applied, reduce your sentence by 553 days. does that make sense to you? yes. do you give up that right and essentially waive your back time as if you did not serve that time in custody? yes. 4 so that means, effectively, your - - the full sentence hanging over your head still exists. [] does counsel join? the court issued a minute order documenting the modified probation conditions. the minute order further stated, appellant was released to blueprint recovery on november 10, 2016. on august 31, 2017, the trial court summarily revoked appellantthe revocation hearing was continued several times before ultimately being held on december 4, 2017. at the revocation hearing , the trial court found appellant violated his probation. the court further found that appellant was not amenable to probation and executed the five-year sentence it originally imposed. the court then determined that appellant was entitled to 96 days of actual custody credit, based on his revocation date of august 31, 2017, as well as an additional 96 days of good-time/work-time credits, for a total of 192 days. the court noted the minute order regarding appellantzero credits up until the current residential treatment program on november 10, 2016 and his arrest on august 13, 2017. appellant the court then read into the record the colloquy quoted above, and remarked that appellant counsel requested that receive s in-t 5 urt said that it did not think appellant was entitled to credit for that because he had waived his back time. when counsel pressed the issue of credits for time in the program, the court suggested there was legal basis appellant told the courtunderstanding, okay, that is fine. but after the fact i did six months, and i completed the program, and i should be eligible for credit for th the court reiterated that appellant would receive 192 days of credit. appellant timely appealed. discussion i. legal standards entitled to credit against his term for all actual days of (people v. buckhalter (2001) 26 cal.4th 20, 30.) section 2900.5, subdivision (a) provides that a convicted against his or her sentence of imprisonment for all days spent in similar residential institutionrved as a condition of probation in compliance with a court order as this 2900.5 . . . apply to custodial time in a residential treatment (people v. jeffrey (2004) 33 cal.4th 312, 318.) entitlement to credits for time spent in a residential 6 (people v. davenport (2007) 148 cal.app.4th 240, 245.) the procedure by which a defendant is placed in a facility that determines the right to credit, but the requirement that the the proceedings relating to the same conduct for which the defendant has been convicted.

(see people v. superior court (jones) (1998) 18 cal.4th 667, 681.) ii. analysis the trial cdays of credit was a knowing and voluntary waiver of any right to credit he may have for participating in the court-ordered residential treatment program. the court alternatively concluded that appellant was not entitled to credits for several other reasons, including his no contest plea, alleged lack of the latter three bases were clearly invalidsection 2900.5, subdivision (a) specifically states that 8 regardless of how effective the court believes that custody was. the parties accordingly focus on the scope and validity of that waiver was, by its terms, exclusively backward-looking. the court advised appellant at the 2016 hearing that he was entitled to 553 days of credit at that point, and asked him if ive your back time as if you did not serve that time the minute order documenting the 2016 back time for all no reasonable person would understand 2016 admonition or minute order that to mean that he or she also was waiving any additional credits that might be earned in the future. indeed, appellant told the court at the 2017 hearing that . respondent points out, accurnor his defense counsel expressed any confusion or disagreement s that does not the 2016 waiver reached future custody credits. in the explicit context of the 553 days of credit appellant already had earned, before the court even imposed the 180-day treatment condition. nce does not amount to acquiescence to a forward-looking waiver. such waivers are permissible, but the totality of the circumstances in this case does not support the conclusion that appellant knowingly made such a waiver here. the question then becomes whether appellant carried his burdens of showing that he spent time at blueprint recovery and 9 2900.5. respondent contends satisfy his burden of showing to the trial court that he was entitled to custody credit as a result of his time at blueprint appellant replies that the record contains sufficient facts from which we can conclude he satisfied his burden. he points to his representation to the court that he spent 180 days in the program, buttressed by a lack of evidence that he appeared before the court due to leaving the program before its completion, program without authorization. alternatively, he contends the point is waived because the prosecutor below did not contest his representation and did not dispute the custodial nature of blueprint recovery, or that we should remand the matter for an evidentiary hearing. the record suppor. both sides were silent below as to the custodial nature of blueprint unsupported assertion that he spent 180 days in the program. this silence can be attributed to the was not entitled to credit due to his waiver; there was no opportunity for litigation regarding the custodial nature of the program or the amount of time appellant spent there. imposing a forfeiture on either party would not be appropriate under the circumstances of this case. we accordingly agree with appellant that the matter should be remanded to give both sides the opportunity to develop the factual record. (see in re wolfenbarger (1977) 76 cal.app.3d 201, 206.) disposition the judgment of the trial court is reversed and the matter 10 is remanded. on remand, the trial court shall hold an evidentiary hearing at which appellant will bear the burden of proving, with appropriate evidence, (1) that he spent time at the blueprint recovery residential treatment facility, and, if so (2) 2900.5, subdivision (a). not to be published in the official reports collins, j. we concur: willhite, acting p.j. dunning, j. * * judge of the orange county superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
