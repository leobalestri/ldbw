(people v. kelly (2006) 40 cal.4th 106, 110.) the complaint charged appellant with two counts of second degree burglary. only count 2 alleged that appellant used a firearm in the commission of the crime. pursuant to a plea bargain, appellant pleaded no contest to count 2 of the complaint and admitted personally using a gun in the crime as alleged in that count. count 1 was dismissed. at the sentencing hearing appellant moved to withdraw his plea claiming that it was based on misinformation from his appointed counsel regarding the facts of the case. he also claimed that he thought he was pleading to count 1 of the information which did not allege a gun use enhancement instead of count 2 which did. the court denied the motion. the court sentenced appellant to the midterm of three years and a consecutive 10 years for the gun use under penal code section 12022.53, subdivision (b). appellant filed a notice of appeal claiming that i didnt know what [no contest] meant[.] the court granted a certificate of probable cause. after appellants appointed counsel on appeal filed a wende brief, appellant filed two letters with us essentially arguing that his plea should be set aside because his attorney provided ineffective assistance. specifically, appellant alleges that his attorney gave him wrong information and there was no evidence that he used a gun in the robbery. the record refutes appellants claims. 3 before accepting appellants plea of no contest the court asked appellant: do you understand that your plea of no contest will be treated the same as a guilty plea by this and every other court? appellant answered: yes, maam. the court mentioned several times that appellant was pleading to count 2 and asked appellant if he had any questions or if there was anything he didnt understand. appellants only question was whether the prison would assign him to fire camp. the court also informed appellant that the complaint alleged that during the commission of the offense in count 2, he personally used a firearm, a handgun, within the meaning of penal code section 12022.53 subdivision (b) and asked appellant: sir, do you admit or deny that allegation? appellant answered: i admit. no evidence of appellants use of a gun was produced because there was no preliminary hearing or trial. appellants counsel explained at the hearing, however, that the police had an identification of appellant by the victim in count 2 along with the victims statement: this is the suspect that held a gun on me. counsel also told the court that she advised appellant that if he did not accept the prosecutions offer of 13 years the prosecution threatened to add a gang enhancement to the charges that would increase the exposure to 30 years. we cannot judge from the record the seriousness of the prosecutions threat. disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published. rothschild, j. we concur: mallano, p. j. chaney, j.
