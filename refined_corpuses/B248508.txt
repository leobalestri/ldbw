(a)) and had served three prior prison terms (pen. code,  667.5, subd. (b)). appellant pleaded not guilty. on march 7, 2013, appellant entered into a plea agreement under which he was to be given a term of four years in state prison. in accordance with the agreement, the information was amended to include a charge of residential burglary (pen. code,  459), to which appellant pleaded nolo contendere. as provided in the plea agreement, the trial court imposed the four-year middle term for residential burglary. in addition, at the sentencing hearing, the court ordered the imposition of a $400 restitution fund fine (pen. code,  1202.4, subd. (b)), a $400 parole revocation fine with payment stayed (pen. code,  1202.45), a $40 court operations assessment (pen. code,  1465.8), and a $30 criminal conviction 3 assessment (gov. code,  70373, subd. (a)(1)). the remaining charge and special allegations were dismissed. this appeal followed.1 facts2 on department were patrolling near the shadown park inn, a location where rock cocaine is often sold. they saw appellwhen appellant noticed the officers, he ran between two rooms, and threw a plastic baggy containing an off-whit the officers detained appellant and recovered the baggie, which was determined to contain rock cocaine. after the officers advised appellant of his miranda rights, and using3 1 nolo contendere restricts the scope of the appeal before us, as (people v. cuevas (2008) 44 cal.4th 374, 379.) generally, under this principle, such as the dismissal of other counts or an agreed maximum punishment, both parties, including thid. at p. 383, quoting people v. panizzon (1996) 13 cal.4th 68, 80.) 2 because the record lacks a transcript of the preliminary hearing, the facts are based otion for discovery under pitchess v. superior court (1974) 11 cal.3d 531. 3 miranda v. arizona (1966) 384 u.s. 436. 4 discussion appellant contends the minute order from the sentencing hearing and the abstract of judgment improperly reflect the imposition of a $10 fine under penal code section 1202.5 and a related $29 penalty assessment.4 we agree. generally, in sentencing a defendant, the trial court is obliged to impose fees and fines in express terms. (people v. high (2004) 119 cal.app.4th 1192, 1200.) here, the court orally imposed several fines and assessments, but mentioned no fine or assessment related to section 1202.5.5 as that provision permits the court to determine whether the defendant has the ability to pay a fine, the imposition of a fine and any related assessment is not mandatory. (people v. castellanos (2009) 175 cal.app.4th 1524, 1533 [upon a determination that defendant lacks the ability to pay, court may decline to impose section 1202.5 fine and related assessments].) because the court ordered no fine or assessment, we presume that it found appellant lacked the ability to pay. (people v. sharret (2011) 191 cal.app.4th 859, 864.) accordingly, the inclusion of the $10 fine and the related $29 assessment in the sentencing minute order and abstract of judgment was error. (people v. zackery (2007) 147 cal.app.4th 380, 385 where there is a discrepancy between the oral pronouncement of judgment and the minute order or the abstract of judgment, the oral pronouncement controls.].) respondent does not dispute this conclusion. 4 all further statutory citations are to the penal code. 5 subdivision (a) of section 1202.5 provides for the imposition of a $10 fine when a defendant is convicted of specified crimes, including residential burglary, provided that the defendant has the ability to pay the fine. generally, when the trial court orders the imposition of a fine under section 1202.5, it is also obliged to impose additional assessments under other statutes. (people v. castellanos, supra, 175 cal.app.4th at pp. 1528-1533.) 5 disposition the trial court is directed to correct the sentencing minute order to eliminate the references to a $10 fine ( 1202.5) and the related $29 assessment, to prepare an amended abstract of judgment reflecting that modification, and to forward the amended abstract to the department of corrections and rehabilitation. in all other respects, the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports manella, j. we concur: epstein, p. j. edmon, j.* *judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
