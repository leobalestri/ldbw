_____________________________ 2 introduction elda rocha drove her boyfriend jherome higuera, a gang member, to an apartment building where he opened fire on a group of teenagers, killing one of them and severely injuring another. rocha waited for higuera while he committed the crimes and drove him away after the shooting. a jury convicted rocha of one count of second degree murder and three counts of attempted murder. the jury also found true gang-related firearms allegations under penal code section 12022.53, subdivisions (d) and (e)(1).1 rocha argues that there was insufficient evidence she aided and abetted the crimes, that there was insufficient evidence to sustain the gang-related firearm enhancements, and that her counsel was ineffective for failing to call a gang expert. she also argues the trial court erred in imposing a term of 25 years to life under section 12022.53, subdivisions (d) and (e)(1), on each of the attempted murder convictions for the two individuals who did not sustain any injuries. we affirm. factual and procedural history a. dia dia, which stands for gang that claims territory in an area west of downtown los angeles. members of dia vandalize property, spray paint the name of the gang in the neighborhoods the gang claims as its territory, carry weapons, and commit robberies and assaults with deadly weapons. 1 statutory references are to the penal code. 3 higuera was a member of dia. he had several dia tattoos, gang moniker and the name of a subset, or clique, of dia. rocha began dating higuera in june 2012, and she knew he was a member of dia. on one occasion in early august 2012, rocha, at higueraup another dia gang member who had been shot by a rival gang member and drove with higuera to the scene of the shooting so higuera could retaliatehiguera meant he and his fellow gang members her tag or, according to b. retaliation on august 17, 2012 higuera received a call from william vasquez, whom rocha knew as a leader of dia who had guns in his house. . . i need use her truck, higuera said, met a13-year-old boy named art t. and his friend j.g. inside saw pictures of dead dia gang members. she heard art t. say that he wanted to join the gang and that some people from another gang had made fun of him. rocha told higuera and vasquez that, while the two men knew higuera and vasquez to involve kids like art t. and j.g. because they talking about shooting people and . . . the stuff you guys have 4 guys ever take them and do something like the stuff i hear you art t. and j.g. got into the back seat of ro, and higuera sat in the front passenger seat. higuera and vasquez told rocha to start driving. art t. uera also took a bag of bullets from the glove compartment. higuera asked art t. where he had been beaten up, and art t. gave rocha directions. when rocha arrived at the location, higuera said to art t., running and said, c. shots higuera, art t., and j.g. walking towards an apartment building. on the porch of the apartment building were four 17-year-olds socializinging and talking, drinking, playing music. the group consisted of jonathan lopez, luis rufino, edwin cruz, and kimberly duarte. the three males were part of a tagging crew as higuera approached the group of teenagers, art t. and j.g. went to an alley next to the apartment building. higuera walked up to the four teenagers and askedthe three young men asked, , higuera and one of the teenagers said, hat the f 5 higuera ,took out a gun and started shooting at the group. fell to the ground and covered her head. lopez ran to the door of the apartment building, which was open, ran inside, and asked someone to call the police. when lopez came back out to the porch, he found cruz on the floor, bleeding from multiple gunshot wounds. cruz did not survive. rufino was shot twice in both legs, and one of the bullets shattered his testicle. lopez and duarte escaped uninjured. d. getaway after higuera shot at the group on the porch, he, art t., and j.g. . as they approached the car, rocha yelled rocha drove them back . in the car, art t. expressed concern he was going to get in trouble with his mother because it was late and she did not know where he was. rocha spoke with art t. on the phone and pretended to be j.g.that art t.s mother would not find out art t. had been involved in the shooting. rocha dropped art t. and j.g. e. more dia when art t. and j.g. r, another member of dia got into the back seat of the car. higuera told around. as rocha drove, higuera and the other gang member saw a man from a rival gang unrelated to the shooting in this case. higuera and the other dia gang member , and the other dia gang member started shooting like crazy. the two men , and 6 rocha drove higuera and the other gang approximately three months later, police found rocha in her car with the engine running near a location where higuera had been spray painting dia graffiti. the police also found an acrylic paint marker in her car. f. charges the people charged rocha with one count of murder and three counts of attempted murder on the theory she aided and abetted the crimes. the people alleged rocha committed the offenses for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with a criminal street gang, with the specific intent to promote, further, or assist in criminal conduct by gang members, within the meaning of section 186.22, subdivision (b)(1). the people also alleged a principal in the commission of the crimes personally and intentionally discharged a firearm causing death to cruz, within the meaning of section 12022.53, subdivisions (d) and (e)(1). g. expert testimony , testified that that a gang member earns respect within the gang by committing violent crimes. by committing violent crimes, gang members create fear in the community and discourage witnesses from testifying, which enables members of the gang to commit further crimes with impunity. women can become involved in gang activity without becoming members of the gang by helping their boyfriends who are members of the gang commit crimes. gangs like to serve as lookouts and 7 to carry weapons, ammunition, and drugs. gang members believe police officers are less likely to search women. based on a hypothetical with facts similar to those in this case, frus testified the shooting was committed to benefit a criminal street gang because it spread fear in the community and the actions were in association with the gang because she drove a car carrying the gang members who committed the shooting and because she stored the ammunition used in the crime in the glove compartment of her car. h. conviction the jury convicted rocha of one count of second degree murder and three counts of attempted murder. the jury also found true the gang-related firearms allegations under section 12022.53, subdivisions (d) and (e)(1), for each count. the trial court sentenced rocha to 40 years to life for the murder conviction (15 years to life for second degree murder plus 25 years to life for the gang-related firearm enhancement) and, for each of the attempted murder convictions concurrent terms of five years plus 25-years-to-life for the gang-related firearm enhancements. rocha timely appealed. discussion a. substantial rectly aided and abetted in the murder as there is no evidence [she] knew [higuera] was going to shoot and kill anyone that night, intended to commit . . . or that she had the requisite intent to 8 commit those same crimes or for [higuera] to commit said , however, misstates the law of aider and abettor liability and misconstrues the evidence showing she aided and abetted higuera in committing the crimes. 1. the applicable law light most favorable to the judgment to determine whether it discloses evidence that is reasonable, credible, and of solid value such that a reasonable jury could find the defendant guilty beyond a people v. sanchez (2016) 63 cal.4th 411, 453-454.)

by his or her own act should the perpetrator fail to do so, nor that the aider and abettor must seek to share the fruits of the crime.people v. beardslee (1991) 53 cal.3d 68, 90; see people v. ogg

[] . . . [] among the factors which may be considered in making the determination of aiding and abetting are: presence at the scene of the crime, companionship, and conduct before and after the people v. nguyen, supra, 61 cal.4th at p. 1054.) the failure to take steps to prevent the commission of the crime (people v. lara (2017) 9 cal.app.5th 296, 322) and flight (people v. medina (2009) 46 cal.4th 913, 924). 2. the substantial evidence there was substantial evidence rocha knew of and shared to kill. rocha knew that higuera was a member of dia, a criminal street gang, and that vasquez was a leader of the gang. higuera had asked rocha to serve as a driver in a gang-related shooting, a fact from which the jury could 11 reasonably infer rocha knew higuera was capable of killing. (see people v. gonzales and soliz (2011) 52 cal.4th 254, 296 ecause [the defendant] had previously committed an armed robbery with [the co-defendant], a jury could reasonably infer [the defendant] knew [the co-defendant] was armed and capable of using deadly force].) the jury could also reasonably infer that on the night of the shooting rocha knew higuera intended to kill because he had previously asked her to serve as the driver for a gang-related crime and she knew that, whenever higuera and his fellow gang members said they were ,they meant they were going to shoot someone. in fact, rocha essentially admitted she knew higuera and vasquez were planning a shooting when she expressed concern that art t. and j.g. were too young to participate in that kind of gang activity. once rocha, higuera, and the two boys were in the car, the motive for and nature of the shooting became even clearer. art t. talked about a group from a rival tagging crew who had attacked him the previous week, and higuera brandished a firearm to show art t. how he was going to even the score. higuera also retrieved ammunition from the glove compartment and asked art t. to give rocha directions to the place he had been attacked. rocha was present and heard the conversation between higuera and art t., which disclosed that the reason rocha was driving higuera and the two boys was to assist higuera in avenging the attack on art t. by shooting his assailants with bullets rocha had in her car. to continue driving to the location of the planned retaliatory attack showed she knew and shared intent. (see people v. lee, supra, 31 cal.4th at p. 624.) once they arrived at the scene and higuera got out of the car, rocha promised higuera she would keep the engine running to aid in their escape. after the attack, rocha encouraged 12 higuera to hurry as he ran back to the car. (see people v. swanson-birabent (2003) 114 cal.app.4th 733, 743-one who is present for the purpose of diverting suspicion, or to serve as a lookout, or to give warning of anyone seeking to interfere, or to take charge of an automobile and to keep the engine running, or to drive the getaway car and to give direct aid to others in making their escape from the scene of the crime, is a principal in the crime committedand the gang expert explained that gangs like dia use women like rocha to assist boyfriends who are gang members in committing crimes.

(see albillar, supra, 51 cal.4th at xpert opinion that particular criminal conduct benefited a gang by enhancing its reputation for viciousness can be sufficient to raise the inference that the ] criminal street eaning of people v. garcia, supra, 9 cal.app.5th at p. 380 the importance of respect to gangs and the need to protect gang territory and comply with requests to commit act of violence from other gang members was substantial evidence the offenses were gang-related].) there was also evidence rocha knew higuera needed a car for the retaliatory shooting ordered by vasquez, and higuera asked her to assist him in carrying out the crime by driving. rocha not only drove higuera to the location of the shooting, she facilitated his flight from the scene. nor was this the only time rocha assisted higuera in committing gang-related crimes: rocha drove higuera to other gang shootings both before and after the august 17, 2012 shooting. the jury reasonably could have concluded from the evidence of conduct that she knew higueramission that evening was to kill members of the rival tagging crew for disrespecting art t. and that her assistance would benefit the gang.

(people v. bolin, at p. 334.) moreover, rocha has failed to establish prejudice. deficient before examining the prejudice suffered by the defendant as a result of the alleged deficiencies. . . . if it is easier to dispose of an ineffectiveness claim on the ground of lack of sufficient prejudice, which we expect will often be so, that course 21 speople v. carrasco, supra, 59 cal.4th at p. 982; see people v. brown, supra, 59 cal.4th at p. 109.) here, even if a defense gang expert had given an opinion rocha was not a gang member, the result would not have been any different because membership in a gang is not an element of the gang enhancement. (see albillar, supra, 51 cal.4th at pp. 67-68.) in addition, the evidence rocha acted in association with the gang and to benefit was to participate in a gang-related shooting, and she actively assisted higuera in carrying out the attack, as she had done before the shooting and as she continued to do after the shooting. there is no reasonable probability that, had counsel for rocha called a gang expert, the result would have been any different.

(ibid.) the supreme court held that under these circumstances multiple subdivid. at p. 1055.) the supreme coecause the requirements of the subdivision (d) enhancements have been satisfied as to each of mpted murder convictions, subdivision (f) of section 12022.53 requires that the enhancement be imposed as to (id. at p. 1056; see people v. palacios (2007) 41 cal.4th 720, 733 [trial court properly imposed three great bodily injury enhancements on three qualifying offenses, even though the defendant fired only one shot at a single victim]; people v. reyes-tornero (2016) 4 cal.app.5th 368, 379 [trial court properly imposed great bodily injury enhancement on the four assault 23 convictions, even though only one of four victims suffered an injury].) higuera fired multiple shots at a group of four people, but only killed one and injured one other. although lopez and duarte escaped uninjured, the jury convicted rocha of three counts of attempted murder and found true for each count the allegations that the offenses were committed for the benefit of a criminal street gang within the meaning of section 186.22, subdivision (b)(1), and that a principal discharged a firearm causing death to cruz within the meaning of section 12022.53, subdivisions (d) and (e)(1). therefore, the trial court properly imposed the section 12022.53 enhancement on the attempted murder convictions for lopez and duarte because the requirements of subdivision (d) were satisfied as to each of [the] oates, supra, 32 cal.4th at p. 1056), and subdivision (e)(1) extended the enhancements to rocha as an aider and abettor (see people v. garcia, supra, 28 cal.4th at p. 1171). disposition the judgment is affirmed. segal, j. we concur: zelon, acting p. j. bensinger, j.* *judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
