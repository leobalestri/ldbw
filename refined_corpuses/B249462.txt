(people v. mooc (2001) 26 cal.4th 1216, 1228.) this court has independently reviewed the sealed transcript of the in camera proceeding on the pitchess motion. we conclude the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that six personnel files should be disclosed. (people v. mooc, supra, 26 cal.4th at p. 1232.) 3 the trial courts amended abstract of judgment was requested and issued after appellants opening brief was filed. 4 disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. manella, j. we concur: epstein, p. j. collins, j.
