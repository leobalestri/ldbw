(b); count 2). the trial court found true the allegation in connection with count 1 that appellant had suffered a prior conviction for a serious and/or violent felony. ( 667, subds. (a)(1), (d), 1170.12, subd. (b).) the court denied probation and sentenced appellant to 11 years in state prison and 364 days in county jail. appellant contends his conviction for robbery lacks substantial evidentiary support. we disagree and affirm. factual background around midnight on friday, june 19, 2015, robert porter was panhandling outside a jack-in-the-box restaurant when he saw appellant burning a book near the drive-through lane. porter approached appellant and asked him what he was doing. appellant d to walk away, he saw appellant urinating on the front door step of the restaurant. porter again approached appellant and said, fuck are you doing? appellant became , you ca 1 undesignated statutory references are to the penal code. 3 porter tried to run away, but appellant caught up with him. threw his change on the ground in front of appellant. appellant picked up the money and ran away. discussion robbery conviction appellant contends that insufficient evidence supports his robbery conviction because he did not form the intent to steal until after he had struck porter, and there was insufficient evidence from which the jury could infer such intent before the use of force. the contention lacks merit. appellant knew porter had money when he struck him, and porter complied with would strike him again. on this evidence, all the elements of robbery are satisfied. in assessing record in the light most favorable to the judgment to determine whether it contains substantial evidencethat is, evidence that is reasonable, credible, and of solid valuefrom which a reasonable trier of fact could find the defendant guilty beyond a reaso people v. avila (2009) 46 cal.4th 680, 701; people v. watkins (2012) 55 cal.4th 999, 10191020.) we draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the verdict and presume the existence of every fact the [jury] could reasonably deduce from the evidence that supports its findings. (people v. maciel (2013) 57 cal.4th 482, 515; people v. kraft (2000) 23 cal.4th 978, 1053.) in reviewing the sufficiency 4 of twhether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. (people v. medina (2009) 46 cal.4th 913, 919.) in this regard, the appellate court is bound to affirm a con that upon no hypothesis whatever is there sufficient substantial evidence to (people v. cravens (2012) 53 cal.4th 500, 508.) he testimony of a single witness is sufficient for the proof of any factpeople v. richardson (2008) 43 cal.4th 959, 1030other evidence, inconsistent or false as to other portions (people v. white (2014) 230 cal.app.4th 305, 319, fn. 14). robbery is the taking of possession of another, against the will and from the person or immediate presence of that person, accomplished by means of force or fear and with the specific intent permanently to deprive no. 9.40; people v. letner and tobin (2010) 50 cal.4th 99, 166.) the force or fear element of robbery is cast in the alternative: that is, a robbery may be accomplished by means of either force or fear. (people v. james (1963) 218 cal.app.2d 166, 170; see also people v. clark (2011) 52 cal.4th 856, 943944 (clark).) the element of fear for purposes of robbery is satisfied when there is sufficient fear to cause the victim to comply with the unlawful demand for his property. (people v. morehead (2011) 191 cal.app.4th 765, 774.) extreme to satisfy this element of robbery. (people v. davison (1995) 32 cal.app.4th 206, 216.) all that is required is evidence 5 ca people v. brew (1991) 2 cal.app.4th 99, 104.) further, direct proof of fear is not required; the jury may infer fear from the circumstances under which the property was taken. (people v. holt (1997) 15 cal.4th 619, 690; clark, supra, 52 cal.4th at p. unlawful demand can convey an implied threat of harm for failure to comply, thus supporting an inference of the requisite people v. morehead, supra, 191 cal.app.4th at p. 775.) the record in this case contains abundant evidence demonstrating that appellant accomplished the robbery of porter by means of fear, and any rational trier of fact would have found the elements of robbery beyond a reasonable doubt. immediately after striking porter in the face, appellant afraid of being hit again as appellant continued to porter pulled out the money he had collected from panhandling and threw it on the ground. appellant picked up the money and ran away. not only did porter testify that he threw the money down out of fear of further attack, but these circumstances readily support the inference that appellant accomplished the taking by means of that fear. we therefore reject challenge to his robbery conviction. 6 disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published. lui, j. we concur: chaney, acting p. j. johnson, j.
