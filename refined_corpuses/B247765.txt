(people v. petznick (2003) 114 cal.app.4th 663, 687.) unauthorized sentences are not subject to the rule of forfeiture. (people v. smith (2001) 24 cal.4th 849, 852.) accordingly, that portion of the courts judgment imposing a parole revocation fine shall be stricken. 4 at the time of appellants sentencing in 2002, section 1202.45 provided: in every case where a person is convicted of a crime and whose sentence includes a period of parole, the court shall at the time of imposing the restitution fine pursuant to subdivision (b) of section 1202.4, assess an additional restitution fine in the same amount as that imposed pursuant to subdivision (b) of section 1202.4. this additional restitution fine shall be suspended unless the persons parole is revoked. 4disposition the judgment in case number pa032653 is modified as follows: the parole revocation fine of $10,000 is stricken. the trial court is directed to amend the abstract of judgment to reflect this modification and to forward certified copies of the amended abstracts to the department of corrections and rehabilitation.
