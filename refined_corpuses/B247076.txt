however, she did not see appellant drinking that day. on the date of the 3 argument with appellant, cooper was on medications risperdal and remeron to treat her depression and bipolarism. cooper has been arrested for domestic violence. however, cooper did not go to prison for the domestic violence arrest. in november of 1995, cooper was sent to prison for robbery. cooper does not have any other convictions besides domestic violence and robbery. procedural history on may 29, 2012, appellant was convicted of one count of selling cocaine and he admitted six prior convictions, all but one of them being convictions for the sale of controlled substances. the trial court imposed the low term of three years and added three years pursuant to health and safety code section 11370.2. the court suspended the sentence and placed appellant on probation. one of the conditions of probation was that --u-to-program. on june 6, 2012, appellant reported to the court that he had been rejected by dare-u-to-care. the court ordered a supplemental probation report and on june 15, 2012, approved for appellant the lamp program and project 180. -gram. the court observed during the hearing on december 17, 2012, that cooper had testified that appellant had lived with her in the tent for five months which, according to the court, meant that he had not complied with the order that he serve one year i-revocation hearing on february 11, 2013, the court stated that it had modified the order in november 2012 to the extent of allowing appellant to spend six months in an outpatient status but that it appeared from correspondence received from project 180 that appellant was living in a shelter or hotel and not in a project 180 facility, i.e., that he was in an outpatient status at project 180. a supplemental probation report was prepared for a status hearing that was held on november 8, 2012. the report noted that appellant was in compliance with his 4 treatment at project 180. the court took note of this report during the hearing on november 8, 2012. the attack on cooper took place on november 22, 2012. the people moved to n on november 27, 2012. -doubt cooper. at the hearing held on january 2, 2013, the court noted that appellant had revocation of the probation. on february 11, 2013, when the court actually revoked ruling, the completely credible. - the assault and battery inflicted on cooper. appellant was sentenced to county jail for six years and received credit for 292 days. he was also ordered to pay various fines and fees. discussion that it was error to revoke probation in the absence of a supplemental probation report is predicated on the theory that appellant was doing well at project 180 and that the trial court would have done differently it if had known about that. this theory fails because probation was revoked on cooper, there is no reason to think that the court would have ruled differently because appellant had done well at project 180. 5 in fact, appellant had not done particularly well at project 180. in a letter dated with his treatment. his attendance was low averaging 2 days per week with 1 - 2 hours of treatment per day despite recommendations that he participate in a significantly more in avoiding a probation violation and that he also said that he was not invested in the treatment program. in addition, there were multiple times that appellant missed treatment for one week or more. we agree with respondent that if it was error not to have ordered a supplemental probation report for purposes of the revocation hearing, the error was harmless. (people v. dobbins (2005) 127 cal.app.4th 176, 182 [lack of supplemental probation report is subject to people v. watson (1956) 46 cal.2d 818 error analysis].) it is simply inconceivable that a probation report prepared after november 2012 would have brought about a more favorable outcome. the court, in revoking probation, was aware of the december 31, 2012 project 180 letter which, one would think, was the final nail in the coffin. in any event, probation was revoked over the assault on cooper without any disposition the judgment (order) is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. boren, p.j. we concur: ashmann-gerst, j. ferns, j.* _______________________________________________________________ * judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
