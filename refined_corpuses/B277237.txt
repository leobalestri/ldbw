(see  1170.12, subds. (a)-(d); 667, subds. (b)-(i).) consequently, the trial court 1 all further code citations are to the penal code unless otherwise indicated. 2 effective january 1, 2012, former section 12021, subdivision (a) was repealed and reenacted without substantive change as section 29800, subdivision (a). (stats. 2010, ch. 711,  4.) all further references to section 12021 are to the former version. 3 sentenced defendant to an indeterminate prison term of 25 years to life. ( 667, subd. (e)(2), 1170.12, subd. (c)(2).) we ain december 1995. in november 2012, voters adopted proposition 36, which prospectively limited the imposition of indeterminate life sentences under the three strikes law by amending sections 667 and 1170.12. prior to proposition 36, a defendant with two or more prior convictions for serious or violent felonies (see  667.5, 1192.7) who also was convicted of any new felony was subject to an indeterminate life sentence. (people v. yearwood (2013) 213 cal.app.4th 161, 167.) pursuant to proposition 36, life sentences are reserved violent felony or the prosecution has pled and proved an (ibid.) proposition 36 also established a postconviction relief sentence imposed pursuant to the three strikes law for a crime that is not a serious or violent felony and who is not disqualified, may have his or her sentence recalled and be sentenced as a second strike offender unless the court determines that resentencing would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. (people v. yearwood, supra, 213 cal.app.4th at p. 168.) pursuant to section 1170.126, subdivision firearm, was armed with a firearm or deadly weapon, or intended ( 667, subd. (e)(2)(c)(iii), 1170.126, subd. (e)(2).) in march 2013, defendant filed a petition requesting recall of his sentence pursuant to section 1170.126. in august 2016, 4 the trial court denied the petition, finding defendant ineligible for resentencing under proposition 36 firearm[d]uring the commission of the current ( 667, subd. (e)(2)(c)(iii), 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(c)(iii), 1170.126, subd. (e).) from de defendant timely appealed from the order denying his petition for resentencing. discussion defendant asserts the trial court erred in concluding that he nderlying offense, arguing that one cannot be armed with a firearm during the commission of the crime of possession of the same firearm. we follow the majority of decisions in rejecting this argument. defendant asserts that the arming requirement must be finding that he was armed cannot be based on an underlying conviction for being a felon in possession of a firearm he acknowledges that appellate courts consistently have rejected this argument under the same circumstances. (see people v. osuna (2014) 225 cal.app.4th 1020, 1029-1032 (osuna) [conviction for possession of a firearm can proposition 36 eligibility purposes]; people v. white (2014) 223 cal.app.4th 512, 524527 (white) [same]; people v. blakely (2014) 225 cal.app.4th 1042, 10511057 [same]; people v. elder (2014) 227 cal.app.4th 1308, 13121314 [same]; people v. brimmer (2014) 230 cal.app.4th 782, 793799 [same]; people v. hicks (2014) 231 5 cal.app.4th 275, 283284 [same]; people v. white (2016) 243 cal.app.4th 1354, 13621363 [same].) he argues these cases were wrongly decided. we disagree. armed with a firearm or other deadly weapon has been statutorily defined and judicially construed to mean having a [weapon] (osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1029, citing  1203.06, subd. (b)(3); health & saf. code,  11370.1, subd. (a); people v. bland (1995) 10 cal.4th 991, 997 (bland) [construing arming enhancement in  12022].) we presume the electorate intended armed with a deadly weapon to have this meaning under proposition 36. (osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1029, citing people v. weidert is deemed to be aware of existing laws and judicial constructions in effect at the tim. . . [and] [t]his following this construction, courts uniformly have held that the armed-with-a-firearm exclusion applies nexus between the arming and the underlying felony, not a where the record indicates the defendant was in actual physical possession of the weapon. (osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1032 [record showed fleeing defendant was observed holding handgun that was discovered during subsequent search of nearby house from which he emerged]; see also white, supra, 223 cal.app.4th at p. 524 [record showed defendant was observed tossing away pair of rolled-up sweatpants containing handgun during police pursuit]; people v. brimmer, supra, 230 cal.app.4th at p. 796 [record showed defendant was personally armed with unloaded shotgun while arguing with his girlfriend].) 6 here, finding that he had a firearm available for use at the time he committed the underlying offense. rather, he maintains exclusion. relying on bland, supra, 10 cal.4th at p. 997, he argues the exclusion should be interpreted to disqualify an inmate from facilitative nexus. this cannot occur where the underlying crime is a possessory offense, as having a gun available does not facilitate the commission of the crime of possession of a firearm by a felon. bland involved a sentencing enhancement that applies of a felony drug possession offense. ( 12022, subd. (c).) the bland court interpreted thin the commissionf felony drug possession as requiring evidence of a (bland, supra, 10 cal.4th at p. 1002.) appellate courts have routinely refused to appunder proposition 36. as the osuna court explained, the construction facilitative nexusbetween the arming and an underlying felony is specific to the g enhancementan additional term of imprisonment added to the base term, for which a defendant cannot be punished until and unless convicted of a related substantive offense. (osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1030.) the court also reasoin the (italics added), [proposition 36] disqualifies an inmate from 7 eligibility for lesser punishment if he or she was armed with a during added). s 3d new internat. dict. (1986) p. 703.) in other words, it requires a temporal nexus between the arming and the underlying felony, not a facilitative one. the two are not the same. (osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1032; accord people v. brimmer, supra, 230 cal.app.4th at pp. 798-799; people v. hicks, supra, 231 cal.app.4th at pp. 283-284; people v. white, supra, 243 cal.app.4th at pp. 1362-1363.) we agree with the reasoning of the osuna line of cases. inconsistent with the intent of the electorate in passing such as firearm possession. it is clear the electorates intent was not to throw open the prison doors for all third strike offenders whose current convictions were not for serious or violent felonies, but only for those who were perceived as nondangerous or posing little or no risk to the public. a felon who has been convicted of two or more serious and/or violent felonies in the past, and most recently had a firearm readily available for use, simply does not pose little or no risk to the public. [t]he threat presented by a firearm increases in direct proportion to its accessibility. obviously, a firearm that is available for use as a weapon creates the very real danger it will be used. [citation.] (people v. blakely, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1057.) thus, we conclude that the trial court did not err in finding that defendant was armed with a firearm when he committed the 8 felon-in-possession offense, and for that reason was ineligible for resentencing. disposition affirmed. not to be published in the official reports collins, j. we concur: epstein, p. j. willhite, j.
