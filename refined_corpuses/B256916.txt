(welf. & inst. code,  10980, subd. (c).) on april 17, 2014, the trial court terminated his probation and sentenced him to three years in state prison, to be served in the county jail pursuant to penal code section 1170, subdivision (h), with a sentencing credit of 101 days for time served. without seeking or obtaining a certificate of probable cause (pen. code,  1237.5), williams timely appealed, challenging only the sentence imposed. we appointed counsel to represent williams on appeal. after examining the record, appointed counsel filed an opening brief certifying he was unable to identify any issue for appellate review and asking this court to independently review the record. (people v. wende (1979) 25 cal.3d 436, 441-442.) on december 17, 2014, we sent letters to williams and appointed counsel, directing counsel to immediately forward the appellate record to williams and advising williams that within 30 days he could personally submit any contentions or issues that he wished us to consider. counsel submitted a declaration confirming that williams was advised of his right to personally file a supplemental brief. no such brief has been submitted. we have examined the entire record and are satisfied that appellants counsel has fully complied with the responsibilities set forth in people v. kelly (2006) 40 cal.4th 106, 3109-110 and people v. wende, supra, 25 cal.3d at p. 441. williamss no contest plea and failure to obtain a certificate of probable cause limit the potential scope of his appeal to [g]rounds that arose after entry of the plea and do not affect the pleas validity or [t]he denial of a motion to suppress evidence under penal code section 1538.5. (cal. rules of court, rule 8.304(b); see pen. code,  1237.5.) the record fails to demonstrate any such issue exists. disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published. chaney, j. we concur: rothschild, p. j. bendix, j.* * judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
