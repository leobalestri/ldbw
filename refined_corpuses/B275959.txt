(veh. code,  10851, subd. (a).) he admitted one prior strike and was sentenced to a term of 2 years 8 months. on appeal, he asks us to reduce his sentence under proposition 47 (pen. code,  1170.18),1 which reduced certain theft-related and drug-related felonies to misdemeanors. must be dismissed for two reasons. first, there is nothing in the record indicating that appellant filed a proposition 47 petition in the superior court. second, appellant did not obtain a certificate of probable cause under section 1237.5, which is a prerequisite to an appeal following a guilty or no contest plea. we therefore dismiss the appeal. factual and procedural background2 appellant agreed to purchase a vehicle from the victims. appellant used a fake name and gave the victims fraudulent $100 bills for the agreed purchase price. when the victims discovered the money was fake, they filed a police report. police officers subsequently arrested appellant and returned the vehicle to the victims. a complaint was filed, alleging that on or about february 19, 2016, appellant committed the crime of driving or taking a vehicle without consent.

( 1237.5.) -appointed counsel filed an opening brief asking this court to review the record independently pursuant to the holding of people v. wende (1979) 25 cal.3d 436, 441 (wende). on december 27, 2016, appellant filed a supplemental brief, stating that he had filed a petition in the superior court under section 1170.18, a provision of proposition 47 enacted in november 2014, seeking to reduce his assault conviction to a misdemeanor. he states in his brief that he had nas of december 23, 2016 and asks this court to reduce his felony conviction to a misdemeanor. 4 that would be a misdemeanor under proposition 47, and for persons who have already completed a sentence for such an offense, the a sentence for a conviction, whether by trial or plea, of a felony or felonies who would have been guilty of a misdemeanor under the act that added this section . . . had this act been in effect at the time of the offense may petition for a recall of sentence before the trial court that entered the judgment of conviction in his or her case to request resentencing 1170.18, subd.

(people v. johnson (2009) 47 cal.4th 668, 677.) we have independently reviewed the record, and neither exception applies here. therefore, the appeal is dismissed for failure to obtain a certificate of probable cause. we have independently reviewed the record and conclude that there are no arguable issues on appeal. (see wende, supra, 25 cal.3d at pp. 441442; see also smith v. robbins (2000) 528 u.s. 259, 278279 [upholding the wende procedure].) 3 vehicle code section 10851 was not directly modified by proposition 47 and is not listed as one of the sections under which resentencing can be requested. the california supreme court is currently reviewing whether a felony conviction for violating vehicle code section 10851, subdivision (a), may be reduced to misdemeanor petty theft ( 490.2, 1170.18), and whether the defendant may be resentenced on a vehicle code section 10851, subdivision (a) conviction as if convicted of misdemeanor petty theft.
