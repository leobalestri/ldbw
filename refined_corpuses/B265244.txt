(b)-(d), 1170.12), to a term of 27 years to life. on appeal, this court affirmed the judgment.2 in 2012, the electorate passed proposition 36, the three strikes reform act of 2012 (prop. 36), which, among other modifications of the three strikes law, added section 1170.126 to the penal code to permit petitions for recall of sentences, and resentencing by individuals who would not have been subject to indeterminate life sentences had they been sentenced under proposition 36. on december 3, 2012, mcgee filed a petition for recall. the trial court issued an order to show cause, and the people filed opposition to the petition, asserting that mcgee was ineligible for resentencing because he was armed during the commission of the offense, and that he was unsuitable for resentencing because of his record. after additional briefing by both parties, and a hearing at which mcgee was represented by counsel, the trial court denied the petition on march 24, 2015, finding mcgee ineligible. mcgee appealed. 1 the statute has been renumbered as 29800, subdivision (a). all further statutory references are to the penal code. 2 people v. mcgee (may 21,1998, b106792 [nonpub.opn.].) 3 discussion on appeal, mcgee argues that former section 12021(a)(1) is not a crime enumerated in proposition 36 as being excluded from eligibility for resentencing, and that, under the circumstances of his conviction, he should not be deemed ineligible for resentencing. as relevant here, an inmate is not eligible for resentencing under section 1170.126 he offenses appearing in clauses (i) to (iii), inclusive, of subparagraph (c) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (e) of section 667 or clauses (i) to (iii), inclusive, of subparagraph (c) of paragraph (2) of subdivision ( 1170.126, subd. (e)(2).) the referenced statutes prohibit treating a third strike offender as a second strike offender for purposes of sentencing if with a firearm or deadly weapon, or intended to cause great bodily injury to another ( 667, subd. (e)(2)(c)(iii), 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(c)(iii).) acknowledging this provision, mcgee argues that these factors may not be part of the offense in question, but must be found in addition to the offense itself. as a result, he argues his conviction, for the possession of a firearm, does not fall within the exclusion. the appellate courts have uniformly rejected this argument, a fact mcgee acknowledges. although he argues those cases were wrongly decided, we disagree. in people v. osuna (2014) 225 cal.app.4th 1020 (osuna), the court noted that the mean having a firearm available for use, eith (id. at p. 1029.) (id. at p. 1030.) the defendant did not dispute this. he claimed, however, as does mcgee, that in order to be ineligible for recall he [argued] one cannot be armed with a firearm during the commission of possession of the same (ibid.) 4 with imposition of an arming enhancementan additional term of imprisonment added to the base term, for which a defendant cannot be punished until and unless convicted of a related substantive offense. (osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1030.) an arming enhancement under section 12022, subdivision (a)(1), may be imposed where the de (osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1031.) both place during the underlying crime and (ibid.) to further the commission of the underlying felony. (ibid.) the crime of possession of a firearm by a felon. thus, a defendant convicted of violating section 12021 does not, regardless of the facts of the offense, risk imposition of between the arming and the possession. however, unlike section 12022, which requires in the commission ofimposed (italics added), [proposition 36] disqualifies an inmate from eligibility for lesser punishmenduring offense (italics added). s 3d new internat. dict. (1986) p. 703.) in other words, it requires a temporal nexus between the arming and the underlying felony, not a facilitative one. the two are not the same. (osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1032.) based on this analysis, the court concludefirearm during possession [of a firearm by a felon]. there was no facilitative nexus; his having the firearm available for use did not further his illegal possession of it. there was, however, a temporal nexus. 5 (e)(2)(c)(iii), 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(c)(iii)), and since at issue is not the imposition of additional punishment but rather eligibility for reduced punishment, . . . the literal language of [proposition 36] disqualifies an inmate from resentencing if he or she was armed with a firearm during th (osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1032; accord, people v. brimmer (2014) 230 cal.app.4th 782, 799 (brimmer); see also people v. berry (2015) 235 cal.app.4th 1417, 1426.) appellate courts in the firearm possession cases have uniformly concluded the ineligibility factor applies whenever the record shows the defendant was in actual physical possession of the firearm, and thus armed. (see brimmer, supra, 230 cal.app.4th at p. 797; osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1030; people v. white (2014) 223 cal.app.4th 512, 525.) they reason that a firearm possession offense that amounts to arming is not a minor non-violent offense for purposes of proposition 36. (see brimmer, supra, 230 cal.app.4th at p. 799.) is not distinguishable. as in osuna, mcgee had the weapon available for use; the record demonstrated the weapon was loaded and within his grasp when he was first sighted by the police. the trial court did not err. disposition the order denying the petition is affirmed. zelon, j. we concur: perluss, p. j. segal, j.
