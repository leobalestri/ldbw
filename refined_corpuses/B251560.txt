(as sergeant seymour later testified, mr. shah a linen wrap worn by indian men. that information had never been disclosed to the public.) defendant did not know who subsequently tied mr. shahthe last time i knowlike i know somebodyi dontied up or not. but i heardi know that he was trying to resist or something, and somebody justyou know what i meanwhacked to the head or anything. it was just, be quiet. you know what i mean? type of truck where he waited. defendant sergeant seymour testified it was defendant who first mentioned the mercedes. defendant also told sergeant ion of mr. shahfatal beating was consistent with mr. shahduring the interview, defendant, who was nervous, expressed fears for his safety and that of his family and ms. pasasouk. sergeant seymour names of certain individuals, especially one conversation, defendant asked if efforts could be taken to protect ms. pasasouk. sergeant 10 seymour testified defendant expressed concern about protecting ms. pasasouk from a specific latino gang. sergeant seymour was asked to describe the structure of the gangs in this state. after referring to the gang mentioned by defendant, sergeant seymour you have southern california hispanic gangs. depending on who you are talking to and the context you are talking to, hispanic gangs can go into a larger or more organized group, leading up to, and who i believe he was eventually talking about was f. forensic evidence footprint evidence was also yard. the only possible match to defendant was deoxyribonucleic acid on a screwdriver found near the armoire in mr. shah were both possible contributors to the mix defendant was a contributor. und on any of several other tools that were examined in addition to the screwdriver. the one pair of g. uncharged burglaries evidence the prosecution presented evidence that subsequent to mr. shah defendant committed several other burglaries. two of the three targeted homes belonged to indian families. on december 21, 2007, a la verne residence was burglarized. the perpetrators entered through a bathroom window that faced the backyard. the victim, ashok patel, was a native of india. mr. patel testified his house was left in disarray: hallcomputer, currency, including indian money, and a lexus automobile were stolen. the 11 lexus was subsequently found at ms. chaialso rented a room in that rowland heights home. ms. chai testified at trial that in december 2008 and january 2009, her boyfriend, steven, was driving a lexus. he january 11, 2 arrived home while the burglary was in progress. he notified law enforcement authorities. a door from the garage into the mr. the master bedroom had been pulled out and stuff dumped on the . . . according to mr. carter, a duffle bag had been filled with old cellular telephones and driveway. several cellular telephones and two ski masks were in the subaru. the discovery of cellular telephones in the subaru was consistent with information ms. pasasouk gave sergeant seymour at their first meeting. ms. pasasouk said defendant had left a cellular telephone in a vehicle abandoned at the scene of a burglary subsequent to the present crimes. moreover, as noted above, defendant admitted he had burglarized the corona home and had left his cellular telephone in the subaru. and a jewelry store ms. pasasouk. home. the burglars entered through a window towards the rear of the house. the house was left in a mess. sergeant luis correa testdisarray. everything that could be knocked off a shelf, overturned, looked at, looked through, it was completely ransacked. mattresses off of the box springs. the rails, paintings off the walls and . . . torn. so evcars were stolena ford taurus, a nissan maxima and a honda accord. on january 11, 2008, investigators searched the rancho cucamonga home where defendant had been staying. the detectives found, among other items, a ca12 whose last name was bhatt. sergeant seymour had been unaware of the anaheim hills burglary until defendant mentioned it. b. the defense case 1. cellular forensics evidence thomas blackburn testified he was employed as an expert witness on matters relating to cellular technology. telephone was in the vicinity of the shah residence at the time of the killing. this was the cellular telephone found in the subaru in corona. on and operating at the time. telephone calls made at 10:28 p.m. and 1:24 a.m. no calls were made or received in the vicinity of the mercedes abandoned in west covina. mr. blackburn conceded there was a 2-hour, 56-minute gap between the last call made on december 3, 2007, and the first call made on december 4, 2007. the cellular telephone data also demonstrated it had been regularly used in the rowland heights and rancho cucamonga areas. 2. forensic evidence mehul anjaria explained the significance of the deoxyribonucleic acid evidence collected at the shah home. mr. anjaria said in a random test of 25 unrelated people, about 1 would be included as a possible contributor to the deoxyribonucleic acid mix on the screwdriver handle. so if you had a population the size of california, 37 million 13 3. false confession evidence richard angelo leo is a law professor who also has a ph.d. in social psychology. more specifically, mr. leo testified about law enforcement interrogation techniques and how they can lead to false confessions. dr. leo testified that the goal of police in other words, to obtain statements, admissions or confessions that can be used to obtain a conviction. dr. leo explained that law enforcement agents frequently attempt to would be better off admitting the crime because the individual will receive leniency. or -defense in order to encourage an admission. the officers may also mischaracterize or falsify facts in an attempt to obtain incriminating statements. dr. leo concluded law enforcement interrogation techniques may lead to a search for statements supporting a conviction while ignoring evidence that does not. iii. discussion a. felony-murder jury instruction 1. legal principles defendant was sentenced to life without the possibility of parole pursuant to a felony murder special circumstance finding under section 190.2, subdivision (a)(17) which in the first degree is death or imprisonment in the state prison for life without the possibility of parole if one or more of the following special circumstances has been found . . . to be 14 true: [] . . . [] (17) the murder was committed while the defendant was engaged in, or was an accomplice in, the commission of, attempted commission of, or the immediate flight after committing, or attempting to commit, the following felonies [including section 190.2, subdivision (b) discusses the special circumstance as applied to the actual killer. section 190.2, subdivisions (c) and (d) address the special circumstance as applied to persons not the actual killer. section 190.2, subdivision he actual killer, who with the intent to kill, aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces, solicits, requests, or assists any actor in the commission of murder in the first degree shall be punished by death or imprisonment in the state prison for life without the possibility of parole . . . italics added.) section 190.2, subdivision actual killer, who, with reckless indifference to human life and as a major participant, aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces, solicits, requests, or assists in the commission of a felony enumerated in paragraph (17) of subdivision (a) which results in the death of some person or persons, and who is found guilty of murder in the first degree therefor, shall be punished by death or imprisonment in the state prison for life without the possibility of parole . . . people v. mil (2012) 53 cal.4th 400, 408-409; people v. estrada (1995) 11 cal.4th 568, 572.) the jury was instructed on felony murder and aiding and abetting liability. however, defendant contends, the attorney general concedes, and we agree there was instructional error. the parties do not dispute there was sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to conclude defendant was not mr. shahactual killer and did not have instruction on the reckless indifference and major participant elements. ( 190.2, subd. (d); people v. mil, supra, 53 cal.4th at p. 409; see people v. rountree (2013) 56 cal.4th 823, 854.) in failing to so instruct, the trial court omitted two essential elements of the charge. (people v. mil, supra, 53 cal.4th at p. 409; see people v. contreras (2013) 58 cal.4th 123, 164.) 15 we apply the harmless error standard of review. (people v. nunez and satele (2013) 57 cal.4th 1, 45; people v. mil, supra, 53 cal.4th at pp. 405, 409-417.) we must conduct a thorough examination of the record to determine whether, beyond a reasonable doubt, the jurpeople v. gonzalez (2012) 54 cal.4th 643, 666; people v. mil, supra, 53 cal.4th at p. 417.) we must consider whether the evidence was such that a rational factfinder could have concluded defendant was not a major participant or did not act with reckless indifference. (people v. gonzalez, supra, 54 cal.4th at p. 666; people v. mil, supra, 53 cal.4th at p. 418.) in other words, we must consider whether the record supports a reasonable doubt as to either omitted element. (people v. gonzalez, supra, 54 cal.4th at p. 666; people v. mil, supra, 53 cal.4th at p. 418.) the instructional error is harmless if the omitted elements were uncontested and are supported by overwhelming evidence. (people v. gonzalez, supra, 54 cal.4th at p. 666; people v. mil, supra, 53 cal.4th at p. 417; see people v. aranda (2012) 55 cal.4th 342, 367-368; people v. marshall (1997) 15 cal.4th 1, 42 [failure to instruct that special circumstance required intent to kill was prejudicial under the chapman v. california (1967) 386 u.s. 18, 24 standard because intent to kill evidence was sufficient but not overwhelming].) 2. major participant 190.2, subdivision (d) does not have a technical meaning peculiar to the law. (people v. proby (1998) 60 cal.app.4th 922, 933; see people v. smithey (1999) 20 cal.4th 936, 980-981.) as used in the term . . . of a . . . (people v. proby, supra, 60 cal.app.4th at pp. 931, 933-934.) (people v. smith (2005) 135 cal.app.4th 914, 928; people v. hodgson (2003) 111 cal.app.4th 566, 578 & fn. 23.) 16 participation than others. (people v. proby, supra, 60 cal.app.4th at p. 934.) there was overwhelming evidence defendant was a major participant in the shah burglary. defendant was a member of a burglary conspiracy. he made his living committing burglaries and other crimes. defendant and his accomplices had committed a series of burglariesfour in the month of december 2007 alone. they routinely stole cash, jewelry, electronics and vehicles. they targeted indian families. they chose the shah home because they knew it contained a safe. they expected to find $60,000 in cash. ms. chai overheard defendant talking to steven, her boyfriend. they discussed ms. pasasouk and ms. chai he had committed the shah burglary. defendant admitted during those conversations assaulting mr. shah. after the assault, mr. shah stopped moving and died. and, in the immediate aftermath of the crime, ms. pasasouk overheard defendant and mr. phong talking about how mr. shah had died. in addition, defendant had a key to ms. pasasouk and ms. chai, defendant, when questioned after his arrest, admitted in some detail his participation in the burglary and homicide. the jury heard a recording of that interview. defendant described how the burglars had gained entrance to the house. admitted observing that mr. shah had been assaulted. when interviewed by sergeant seymour, defendant described why mr. shah resist or something, and something just - you know what i mean - whacked him. but he defendant described an assault that was consistent with mr. shahdeoxyribonucleic acid was on a screwdriver found in the shaharguably less than significant in a vacuum, this was material evidence of guilt when viewed in light of the record as a whole. defendant participated in the burglary from its 17 commencement until he and his accomplices made their escape. when he learned he was suspected of burglary and murder, defendant attempted to flee. this was overwhelming evidence defendant was a major participant within the meaning of section 190.2, subdivision (d). no rational juror could have a reasonable doubt whether defendant was a major participant. be unreasonable to go against a charge in this case of [first] degree murder because there asks us to conclude the jury posed the question because it was unconvinced defendant was a major participant in the burglary. however, speculation. (see people v. boyce (2014) 59 cal.4th 672, 716; people v. tamborrino (1989) 215 cal.app.3d 575, 587.) 3. reckless indifference to human life (d), derives from the opinion in tison v. arizona (1987) 481 u.s. 137, 158, and footnote 12. (people v. estrada, supra, 11 cal.4th at p. 575.) in tison, the united states supreme [r]reckless disregard for criminal activities known to carry a grave risk of death . . . tison v. arizona, supra, 481 u.s. at p. 157; see ring v. arizona (2002) 536 u.s. 584, 594.) the united states the most dangerous and inhumane of allthe person who tortures another not caring whether the victim lives or dies, or the robber who shoots someone in the course of the robbery, utterly indifferent to the fact that the desire to rob may have the unintended indifference to the value of human life may be every bit as shocking to the moral sense as 18 tison v. arizona, supra, 481 u.s. at p. 157; see schad v. arizona (1991) 501 u.s. 624, 644.) in people v. estrada, supra, 11 cal.4th at pages 577-578, our supreme court held law. rather, our supreme court explainedthe defendant was subjectively aware that his or her participation in the felony involved a 1981) p. 1151, col. 1.) to regard something, even to regard it as worthless, is to be aware of it. (see id. at p. 1911, col. 1 people v. estrada, supra, 11 cal.4th at p. 577; see people v. miranda (2011) 199 cal.app.4th 1403, 1421.) our ss of the grave risk to human life created people v. estrada, supra, 11 cal.4th at p. 578; accord, people v. mil, supra, 53 cal.4th at p. 417 t knowingly engaged in criminal conduct with subjective awareness the activity involved a grave risk of death]; see, e.g., people v. lopez (2011) 198 cal.app.4th 1106, 1117; people v. smith, supra, 135 cal.app.4th at pp. 927-928.) there was overwhelming evidence defendant acted with reckless indifference to human life. defendant was one of four perpetrators of the present crimes. defendant admitted to ms. pasasouk tying up, holding down and kicking mr. shah several times. defendant told ms. pasasouk and ms. chai he thought he had killed somebody. defendant and the other burglars beat mr. shah. enough force was used to fracture mr. shahmr. shah stopped moving. defendant thought mr. shah might have suffered a heart attack. defendant nevertheless 19 left mr. shah bound and lying face down on the floor. defendant made no attempt to assist mr. shah. even when viewed in a light favorable to defendant, albeit discounting his false confession crisk of death. when interviewed, defendant admitted observing that mr. shah had been assaulted and was incapacitated. defendant knew mr. shah had resisted and had been defendant saw mr. shah mr. shah was on his knees with his upper torso sprawled across the bed. someone was trying to hold mr. shah they [wanted to] put him in thmr. shah and remove the body from the house. instead, defendant returned to his truck. this act of leaving the residence resulted in leaving mr. shah accomplices. defendant made no attempt to summon help. no rational juror could have a reasonable doubt whether defendant acted with reckless disregard for human life. this case is distinguishable from people v. mil, supra, 53 cal.4th at pages 417-419. in mil, our supreme court considered whether a failure to instruct on the major participant and reckless indifference elements of felony murder was harmless error. our supreme court found there was substantial evidence the defendant had participated in a burglary and robbery in a motel room and had stabbed and killed the victim. however, our supreme court found there was also evidence the defendant had left the motel room ahead of his girlfriend. she then had an opportunity, unbeknownst to the defendant, to stab and kill the victim. the supreme court concluded the evidence supported a finding the defendant was unaware that: his girlfriend planned to use any force; that she was armed with a knife; or that she stabbed the victim. therefore, a rational juror could have a reasonable doubt whether the defendant was subjectively aware of a grave risk of death when he participated in the burglary and robbery. the instructional error was not therefore harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. (id. at p. 419.) unlike the defendant in mil, defendant cannot claim ignorance of mr. shahdefendant admitted 20 perceiving mr. shah. and defendant intent and conduct. b. evidence suppression motion which was [the] product of the original illegal taking of any property . . . which was and . . . any computer evidence . . . (emphasis omitted.) . . . computers seized . . . . appeal, defendant argues the trial court improperly denied his motion to suppress a suppress evidence obtained from his cellular telephone. the later issue was never raised in the trial court. as a result it was forfeited. ( 1538.5, subd. (m); people v. williams (1999) 20 cal.4th 119, 136; people v. davis (2008) 168 cal.app.4th 617, 629.) a section 1538.5 motion must be made in writing and must specifically list the items of property or evidence sought to be suppressed. ( 1538.5, subd. (a)(2).) the only item defendant specifically identified as having been seized from the hotel room was a uppression denial ruling was admission of the challenged evidence was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt under chapman v. california, supra, 386 u.s. at page 24. (people v. moore (2011) 51 cal.4th 1104, 1128-1129; people v. prince (2007) 40 cal.4th 1179, 1250.) the primary issue at on the computer seized at the hotel tended to corroborate evidence defendant and his determination of the central issues at trial. in light of the overwhelming evidence of 21 people v. moore, supra, 51 cal.4th at pp. 1128-1129; people v. prince, supra, 40 cal.4th at p. 1250.) c. uncharged burglaries evidence 1. defenda defendant asserts it was prejudicial error to admit uncharged burglaries evidence. (evid. code,  1101, subd. (b).) defendant argues there was insufficient uniqueness and similarity to support admission. we find no abuse of discretion. 2. controlling legal principles particular occasion or criminal disposition. (evid. code,  1101, subd. (a); people v. harris (2013) 57 cal.4th 804, 841; people v. thomas (2011) 52 cal.4th 336, 354.) but it may be admitted to prove some other fact such as intent, identity or common design. (evid. code,  1101, subd. (b); people v. harris, supra, 57 cal.4th at p. 841; people v. thomas, supra, 52 cal.4th at p. 354.) the prosecupurposes for which other crimes evidence may be considered. the necessary degree of similarity between the charged and uncharged crimes depends on the element sought to be proved. (people v. ewoldt (1994) 7 cal.4th 380, 402; accord, people v. harris, supra, 57 cal.4th at p. 841; people v. thomas, supra, 52 cal.4th at p. 355.) our review is for an abuse of discretion. (people v. harris, supra, 57 cal.4th at p. 841; people v. thomas, supra, 52 cal.4th at pp. 354-355.) our supreme court has explained: people v. thomas, supra, 52 cal.4th at pp. 354-355; people v. carter (2005) 36 cal.4th 1114, 1149.) the trial court did not abuse its discretion. 22 3. intent the least degree of similarity is required to prove intent. our supreme court has sufficiently similar to support the people v. robbins [(1988)] 45 cal.3d 867, people v. ewoldt, supra, 7 cal.4th at p. 402; accord, people v. harris, supra, 57 cal.4th at p. 841; people v. thomas, supra, 52 cal.4th at p. 355.) when interviewed after his arrest, defendant admitted he had committed a number of burglaries. in each of the prior cases, as in the present case, the burglars took jewelry, electronics, cash and vehicles. defendant admitted being present evidence alburglary. it undermined his effort to portray himself as a mere driver and lookout. 4. common design or plan a greater degree of similarity is required to prove a common design or plan. (people v. thomas, supra, 52 cal.4th at p. 355; people v. ewoldt, supra, 7 cal.4th at p. 402.) design or plan, the common features must indicate the existence of a plan rather than a series of similar spontaneous acts, but the plan thus revealed need not be distinctive or unusual. . . . . [e]vidence that the defendant has committed uncharged criminal acts that are similar to the charged offense may be relevant if these acts demonstrate circumstantially that the defendant committed the charged offense pursuant to the same design or plan he or she used in committing the uncharged acts. unlike evidence of uncharged acts used to prove identity, the plan need not be unusual or distinctive; it need only exist to support the inference that the defendant employed that plan in committing 23 the charged offense. (see people v. ruiz [(1988)] 44 cal.3d 589, 605-people v. ewoldt, supra, 7 cal.4th at p. 403; accord, people v. edwards (2013) 57 cal.4th 658, 712.) the manner in which the other burglaries and the present burglary were committed was sufficiently similar to support an inference defendant committed the present burglary pursuant to the same plan. the charged and uncharged burglaries were all committed in the same month, december 2007. all but one was committed against an indian family. in each case the perpetrators entered through a door or window in an area not visible from the street. they ransacked the houses. they stole jewelry, electronics, cash and vehicles. 5. identity the greatest degree of similarity is required for the uncharged crimes evidence to be relevant to prove identity. (people v. harris, supra, 57 cal.4th at p. 841; people v. ewoldt, supra, 7 cal.4th at p. 403.) as our supreme court has held: established, the uncharged misconduct and the charged offense must share common features that are sufficiently distinctive so as to support the inference that the same person committed both acts. (people v. miller people v. ewoldt, supra, 7 cal.4th at p. 403.) the distinctive features of the uncharged and charged burglaries were threefold. first, the burglars targeted indian families. second, they ransacked the houses leaving little untouched. third, they stole vehicles. these unusual features were sufficient to support an inference the same person or persons committed all of the crimes. 24 d. the gonzalez matter herbert gonzales, a former defendant in a [murder] case (dismissed july, 2006 on motion [sergeant] randall seymour in his mode of interrogation, intimidation, fabrication and exploitationall in an effort to make it appear to a courtat some later timethat [sergeant] seymour obtained a freely given, voluntary confession, or statements against defendant represented that mr. gonzalez was under subpoena and available to testify. the trial court denied the motion. prior to the present trial, defendant sought permission to cross-examine sergeant seymour about the gonzalez matter. defendant asked the trial court to take judicial notice of newspaper articles discussing the gonzalez case. the trial defendant argues the trial court abused its evidence code section 352 discretion and violated his confrontation and fair trial rights under the state and federal constitutions. defendant forfeited any claim in the present appeal with respect to testimony by present trial. defendant made no showing mr. gonzalez was under subpoena or otherwise available to testify. defendant cannot now claim the trial court erred in refusing to allow mr. gonzalez to testify. (see people v. dowl (2013) 57 cal.4th 1079, 1087-1089; people v. thompson (2010) 49 cal.4th 79, 129-130.) for an abuse of discretion. (people v. clark (2011) 52 cal.4th 856, 893; people v. williams (2008) 43 cal.4th 584, 634-635.) as our supreme court explained in williams: disturbed on appeal except on a showing that the court exercised its discretion in an 25 arbitrary, capricious or patently absurd manner that resulted in a miscarriage of justice. people v. rodrigues [(1994)] 8 cal.4th [1060,] 1124-(people v. williams, supra, 43 cal.4th at pp. 634-635.) we find no such abuse of discretion in concluding the probative value was not outweighed by potential prejudicial effect. first, in the gonzalez matter, there apparently was exculpatory deoxyribonucleic acid evidence lending credence to a false confession claim. there was no such exculpatory evidence in third, defendant presented testimony from dr. lee as to the aim and effect of law enforcement interrogation techniques. fourth, the trial court could reasonably conclude reference to the isolated gonzalez matter in cross-examination of sergeant seymour would tend to confuse the jury, cause it to speculate as to the settlement, and take up undue time. (people v. moore (2011) 51 cal.4th 386, 407, fn. 6.) we find no constitutional fair trial or confrontation violation. this is beca[a]s a general matter, the ordinary rules of right to present a defense. [citations.] (people v. robinson (2005) 37 cal.4th 592, 626-(people v. prince, supra, 40 cal.4th at p. 1245.) there is no defendant makes passing reference on appeal to a request to discover information as to other homicide cases investigated by sergeant seymour. this argument is insufficiently developed to warrant discussion. (see people v. fuiava (2012) 53 cal.4th 622, 726; people v. barnett (1998) 17 cal.4th 1044, 1182; people v. bonin (1989) 47 cal.3d 808, 857, fn. 6.) we note that we previously denied a mandate petition as to the overbroad motion is unsupported by any relevant evidence, has failed to demonstrate an yi v. superior court (apr. 21, 2011, b232421) [nonpub. order].) we reiterate that analysis today. 26 e. the confidential informant prior to the first trial in this case, on february 3, 2010, defendant filed a motion for confidential informant disclosure. defendant relied on information from the sergeant seymour spoke with a narcotics detective. the narcotics detective told sergeant seymour an anonymous informant had identified defendant as mr. shahin identifying the murderer, the informant two brothers, were with defendant at the time. later that day sergeant seymour spoke with the anonymous informant. the informant said mr. phong, steven and defendant committed burglaries. mr. phong and steven, but not defendant, were staying at a house in philips ranch. there were guns, drugs and stolen property in the philips ranch residence. prior to the foregoing conversation, defendant argues there was no connection between him known connection between or innocence, including the requirement . . . the burglaries . . . . a public entity has a pidentity when the need to preserve confidentiality outweighs the need for disclosure. (evid. code,  1041; people v. hobbs (1994) 7 cal.4th 948, 958-959.) the privilege gives way only when it appears the informant is a material witness on the question of guilt or innocence and nondisclosure would result in a fair trial denial. (people v. lawley (2002) 27 cal.4th 102, 159; people v. borunda (1974) 11 cal.3d 523, 527; people v. hobbs, supra, 7 cal.4th at p. 959; people v. navarro (2006) 138 cal.app.4th 146, 163.) disclosure is required upon an adequate showing an informant: participated in the crime or was an eyewitness to it; is a witness to circumstances preceding the crime; or otherwise can give evidence that might exonerate the defendant or offer an affirmative defense. (people v. lawley, supra, 27 cal.4th at p. 159; twiggs v. superior court (1983) 27 34 cal.3d 360, 365; price v. superior court (1970) 1 cal.3d 836, 844.) the burden is on the defendant to demonstrate a reasonable possibility the informant could give potentially exculpatory evidence. (people v. lawley, supra, 27 cal.4th at pp. 159-160; people v. borunda, supra, (people v. gordon [(1990)] 50 cal.3d [1223,] 1246[, overruled on a different point in people v. edwards (1991) 54 cal.3d 787, 835].)people v. lawley, supra, 27 cal.4th at pp. 159-160.) the necessary showing requires more than speculation or a mere suspicion the information will be relevant and helpful to the defense or essential to a fair trial. (davis v. superior court (2010) 186 cal.app.4th 1272, 1276; people v. luera (2001) 86 cal.app.4th 513, 526.) it requires at least a reasonable possibility. (ibid.) our review is for an abuse of discretion. (people v. hobbs, supra, 7 cal.4th at p. 976; davis v. superior court, supra, 186 cal.app.4th at p. 1277.) there was no abuse of discretion. defendant made no showing of even a reasonable possibility the confidential informant was in any position to offer exculpatory evidence or support an affirmative defense. f. cumulative error defendant contends he is entitled to reversal because of cumulative error. we find effect of all the errors requires reversal. (people v. jones (2013) 57 cal.4th 899, 981; people v. edwards, supra, 57 cal.4th at p. 746.) g. peace officer personnel records camera hearing for review of peace officer personnel records. (people v. mooc (2001) 26 cal.4th 1216, 1228-1232; pitchess v. superior court (1974) 11 cal.3d 531, 535.) the 28 occurred. (people v. myles (2012) 53 cal.4th 1181, 1209; people v. mooc, supra, 26 cal.4th at pp. 1228, 1232.) h. sentencing 1. cruel and unusual punishment defendant contends his life-without-parole sentence as applied to him is so disproportionate that it constitutes cruel and unusual punishment under the state and federal constitutions. defendant asserts he did not participate in the killing. defendant denies intending that mr. shah die. defendant claims he did not want to be involved in moving mr. shah from the scene of the killing. defendant argues he was not a major participant in the burglary and did not act with reckless indifference to human life. further asserts 16 states impose less severe punishment for felony murder. we disagree. the eighth amendment to the united states constitution prohibits cruel and unusual punishment. the eighth amendment does not require strict proportionality between the crime and sentence; rather, it forbids sentences that are grossly disproportionate to the severity of the crime. (ewing v. california (2003) 538 u.s. 11, 23-24 ewing); see in re coley (2012) 55 cal.4th 524, 529.) three factors are considered: the gravity of the offense and the harshness of the penalty; sentences imposed for other crimes in the same jurisdiction; and sentences imposed for the same crime in other jurisdictions. (ewing, supra, 538 u.s. at p. 22; in re coley, supra, 55 cal.4th at p. 540.) here, defendant addresses only the first and third factors. a sentence may be cruel or unusual under the california constitution, article i, section 17. such a sentence though must be so disproportionate to the crime that it shocks the conscience and offends fundamental notions of human dignity. (people v. virgil (2011) 51 cal.4th 1210, 1287-1288; in re lynch (1972) 8 cal.3d 410, 424.) we 29 consider the nature of the offense, the offender and the particular circumstances of the crime. (people v. gonzales (2012) 54 cal.4th 1234, 1300; people v. dillon (1983) 34 cal.3d 441, 478 (dillon).) further, because choosing appropriate criminal penalties is a legislative function, a court must not intervene unless the prescribed punishment is out of proportion to the crime. (ibid.; people v. felix (2003) 108 cal.app.4th 994, 999-1000.) the sentence imposed on defendant was not cruel or unusual under the state or federal constitutions. defendant participated in a burglary during which mr. shah was killed. defendant attempts to downplay his involvement. however, defendant was a member of a burglary conspiracy that had committed multiple burglaries. the conspiracy targeted indian families. the perpetrators routinely stole cash, jewelry, electronics and vehicles. during the present burglary, defendant, at a minimum, tied up mr. shah. there is evidence defendant held down and kicked mr. shah. mr. shah stopped moving. defendant thought mr. shah might have had a heart attack. defendant later spoke to ms. pasasouk. defendant expressed fear that mr. shah may have been killed. mr. shahrefused. defendant left the shah residence without taking any steps to aid mr. shah. defendant took no steps to preserve mr. shahs life. mr. shah was found face down on his bedroom floor with his hands and feet bound. mr. shah had suffered multiple blunt force injuries. his spine, vertebrae and ribs had been fractured. in the years preceding the present crime, defendant had been convicted of several felonies. on march 13, 2002, defendant was convicted of assault with a deadly weapon other than a firearm ( 245, subd. (a)(1)) and placed on probation. however, on december 3, 2003, defendant was arrested for first degree burglary ( 459) and burglary tools possession ( 466). and on february 18, 2004, defendant was arrested for felony vehicle theft (veh. code,  10851, subd. (a)). on march 16, 2004, defendant received a 16-month sentence consecutive to his burglary sentence. defassault case was revoked and on september 16, 2004, defendant was sentenced to two years in state prison. on february 10, 2005, defendant was convicted of burglary and sentenced to two years in state prison. his sentence was concurrent with the assault case. 30 defendant was paroled on september 23, 2005. he was discharged from parole on september 13, 2007. less than three months later, defendant committed the present crimes. when interviewed after his arrest, defendant admitted having committed seven or eight additional burglaries. defendant relies on enmund v. florida (1982) 458 u.s. 782, 784 and dillon, supra, 34 cal.3d at page 480. in enmund, a robbery at a farmhouse ended in a murder. but there was no evidence the defendant was present at the farmhouse when the murder occurred. it appeared, instead, the defendant was the driver who waited in a car by the side of the road a few hundred feet away. (enmund v. florida, supra, 458 u.s. at pp. 783-788.) the united states supreme court found the defendant did not personally kill or attempt to kill. the record did not warrant a finding he had any intention of participating in or facilitating a murder. and he merely aided and abetted a robbery during which a murder was committed. the united states supreme court concluded that under those circumstances the death penalty was impermissible under the eighth amendment. (enmund v. florida, supra, 458 u.s. at p. 798.) the circumstances of the present case are not comparable. here, there was overwhelming evidence defendant was not merely a driver but fully participated in the burglary during which mr. shah was murdered. enmund is inapplicable under the facts of our case. (people v. contreras, supra, 58 cal.4th at pp. 162-164; people v. young (2005) 34 cal.4th 1149, 1205.) and this case does not involve the death penalty, an important element of the enmund analysis. (see people v. contreras, supra, 58 cal.4th at p. 163; people v. letner and tobin (2010) 50 cal.4th 99, 192-193; people v. lancaster (2007) 41 cal.4th 50, 81-90.) in dillon, a 17-year-old and several others went to a marijuana farm to steal some marijuana. the defendant carried a .22 semi-automatic rifle. some of his friends were armed with shotguns. they encountered an armed security guard. one of the firing his weapon. the defendant fatally shot the guard. our supreme court concluded the punishment for first degree murder was cruel and unusual under the circumstances and reduced the judgment to second degree murder. the court reasoned that when the 31 defendant heard gunshots, he thought one of his friends had been shot, and he thought he would be next. (people v. dillon, supra, 34 cal.3d at pp. 482-483.) in addition, there was evidence the defendant was extremely immature and exercised poor judgment. (id. at p. 483.) our supreme court noted that because the defendant was a minor, he would have received the same sentence as that the trial court imposed even if he had committed premeditated and deliberate first degree murder. (id. at p. 487.) there are no comparable circumstances in the present case. defendant, a recidivist, was not a minor. there was no evidence he was immature or exercised poor judgment. there was no evidence he acted out of fear he would be shot or otherwise harmed. dillon is not controlling. (people v. rhodes (2005) 126 cal.app.4th 1374, 1389; people v. valdez (2005) 126 cal.app.4th 575, 581; see witkin & epstein, cal. criminal law (4th ed. 2012) punishment,  283, pp. 385-386.) additionally, as the attorney general points out, a number of other jurisdictions authorize a life-without-parole sentence for felony murder. these include: colorado (colo. rev. stat.  18-3-102, 18-1.3-401; georgia (ga. code  16-5-1; iowa (iowa code  702.11(1), 707.2(1)(b), (2), 902.1; louisiana (la. rev. stat.  14:30); mississippi (miss. code ann.  97-3-19(2)(e), 97-3-21(3)); nevada (nev. rev. stat.  200.030(1)(b), (4)(b)); north dakota (n.d. cent. code,  12.1-16-01(1)(c), 12.1-32-01(1)); oklahoma (okla. stat. ann. 21,  701.7(b), 701.9(a)); and tennessee (tenn. code ann.,  39-13-202(a)(2), (c)). other jurisdictions treat the aggravated circumstances in our case as a matter requiring a life sentence without the possibility of parole. the sentence of life without the possibility of parole violates no provision of the state or federal constitutions. 2. the prior prison term enhancements we asked the parties to brief the question whether the trial court was required to either impose or strike ( 1385, subd. (a)), rather than stay, the section 667.5, subdivision (b) prior prison term enhancements. (people v. langston (2004) 33 cal.4th 1237, 1241; 32 people v. garcia (2008) 167 cal.app.4th 1550, 1561; see people v. johnson (2006) 145 cal.app.4th 895, 908, fn. 20.) the parties agree. the failure to either impose or strike a prior prison term enhancement is a jurisdictional error that may be corrected for the first time on appeal. (people v. garcia, supra, 167 cal.app.4th at p. 1562; in re renfrow (2008) 164 cal.app.4th 1251, 1254.) upon remittitur issuance, the trial court is to exercise its discretion whether to impose or strike the prior prison term enhancements ( 667.5, subd. (b)) as to each of counts 1 and 3 through 6. iv. disposition the judgment staying the penal code section 667.5, subdivision (b) prior prison term enhancements is reversed. upon remittitur issuance, the trial court is to exercise its discretion whether to impose or strike the prior prison term enhancements ( 667.5, subd. (b)) as to each of counts 1 and 3 through 6. the judgment is affirmed in all other respects. not to be published in the official reports turner, p.j. i concur: kriegler, j. mosk, j., concurring i concur. in neder v. united states (1999) 527 u.s. 1 (neder), the united states supreme court held that a jury instruction that erroneously omits elements of the offense is subject to a harmless error analysis. the harmless error standard is governed in such a case by chapman v. california (1967) 386 u.s. 18. (see washington v. recuenco (2006) 548 u.s. 212, 213.) justice scalia dissented in neder criminal defendant of the right to have the jury determine his guilt of the crime chargedwhich necessarily means his commission of every element of the crime chargedcan neder, supra, 527 u.s. at p. 30.) although i believe justice people v. flood (1998) 18 cal.4th 470, 522 (mosk, j., dissenting), i am bound to follow the california supreme court decision following neder. (see people v. aranda (2012) 55 cal.4th 342; people v. gonzalez (2012) 54 cal.4th 643, 663; people v. mil (2012) 53 cal.4th 400; people v. chun (2009) 45 cal.4th 1172; people v. concha (2010) 182 cal.app.4th 1072, 1085-1089.) i concur in the judgment. mosk, j.
