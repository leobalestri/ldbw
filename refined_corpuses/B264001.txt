(a)) and an additional six-year term. the defense submitted evidence that petitioner had received satisfactory and above average grades from his work supervisor at the prison laundry, participated in narcotics anonymous classes, and was the defense also presented expert testimony by richard subia, a prison practices expert, and dr. hy malinek, a clinical and forensic psychologist. 2 cdc 115 documents misconduct believed to be a violation of law which is not minor in nature.in re gray (2007) 151 cal.app.4th 379, 389; see also cal. code regs., tit. 15,  3312, subd.

(people v. birkett (1992) 21 cal.4th 226, 231.) furthermore, although courts may not generally subject to judicial correction in order to best carry out the intent of the adopting body. (people v. skinner (1985) 39 cal.3d 765, 775.) 2. proposition 36 prior to its amendment by [proposition 36], the three strikes law required that a defendant who had two or more prior convictions of violent or serious felonies receive a third strike sentence of a minimum of 25 years to life for any current felony conviction, even if the current offense was neither serious nor violent. (former  667, subds. (d), (e)(2)(a), 1170.12, subds. (b), (c)(2)(a).) [proposition 36] amended the three strikes law with respect to defendants whose current conviction is for a felony that is neither serious nor violent. in that circumstance, unless an exception applies, the defendant is to receive a second strike sentence of twice the term otherwise provided for the current felony, pursuant to the provisions that apply when a defendant has one prior conviction 6 fopeople v. johnson (2015) 61 cal.4th 674, 680681.) ceeding whereby a prisoner who is serving an indeterminate life sentence imposed pursuant to the three strikes law for a crime that is not a serious or violent felony and who is not disqualified, may have his or her sentence recalled and be sentenced as a second strike offender unless the court determines that resentencing would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to people v. yearwood (2013) 213 cal.app.4th 161, 168.) in determining whether the petitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of danger history, including the type of crimes committed, the extent of injury to victims, the length of prior prison commitments, and the remoteness disciplinary record and record of rehabilitation while incarcerated; and [] (3) any other evidence the court, within its discretion, determines to be relevant in deciding whether a new sentence would result in an u( 1170.126, subd.

(see, e.g., people v. valencia (2014) 232 cal.app.4th 514, review granted february 18, 2015, s223825; people v. chaney (2014) 231 cal.app.4th 1391, review granted february 18, 2015, s223676; people v. florez (2016) 245 cal.app.4th 1176, review granted june 8, 2016, s234168; people v. myers (2016) 245 cal.app.4th 794, review granted may 25, 2016, s233937; people v. garcia (2016) 244 cal.app.4th 224, review granted april 13, 2016, s232679; people v. lopez (2015) 236 cal.app.4th 518, review granted july 15, 2015, s227028.) we conclude, consistent with the majority of courts to have considered 9 this issue, we recognize the basic principle of statutory and constitutional construction which mandates that courts, in construing a measure, not undertake to rewrite its unambiguous language. [citation.] that rule is not applied, however, when it appears clear that a word has been erroneously used, and a judicial correction will best carry out the intent of the adopting body. [citation.] . . . whether the use of [a particular word] is, in fact, a drafting error can only be determined by reference to the purpose of the section and the intent of thpeople v. skinner, supra, 39 cal.3d at pp. 775776.) for the reasons that follow, we conclude that the voters erroneously used the word codein section 1170.18, subdivision (c), and that this error is properly subjected to judicial correction. specifically, as we now discuss, we believe the voters intended in section 1170.18, subdivision (c) to refer to proposition 47, not to the entire penal code. we therefore conclude that the passage of proposition 47 did not alter proposition 36 or section 1170.126. uage do not indicate that proposition 47 itself. to the contrary, subdivision (n) states, and related sections is intended to diminish or abrogate the finality of judgments in any case not falling within the purview of this act, italics added.) if a court ruling on a proposition 36 petition must grant the petition unless it finds an unreasonable by section 1170.18, subdivision (c), the finality of the underlying judgment may be [ed] (id.,  1170.18, sub. (n).) likewise, the official title and summary, legal analysis, and arguments for and against proposition 47 nowhere suggest that proposition 47 will have an impact on proposition 36. (voter information guide, supra, pp. 34-39.) the ballot materials do 10 not, for example, say that proposition 47 will severely restrict the ability of courts to reject resentencing petitions under proposition 36. rather, the ballot materials emphasize that the resentencing provisions of proposition 47 will affect only those persons serving sentences for specified nonserious, nonviolent property or drug crimes. accordingly, nothing in proposition 47 resentencing under proposition 36. furthermore, propositions 36 and 47 have different purposes. proposition 36 is designed to reduce penalties for individuals with two or more prior serious or violent felony convictions, whose current conviction is also a felony. by contrast, proposition 47 is intended to reduce penalties for low-level offenders who have nonserious and nonviolent property and drug offenses (voter information guide, supra, p. 35.) the wording of section 1170.18, subdivision (c) is also inconsistent with an intent to apply that subdivision throughout the entire penal code. subdivision (c) refers to the to refer to persons petitioning ).) suggests that the term is limited to individuals petitioning under that particular act. (id.,  1170.18, sub. (c).) lastly, the timing of proposition 47 is inconsistent with an intent to affect proposition 36 petitions. proposition 36 required defendants to file petitions within two years from its enactment absent a showing of good cause for a late petition. ( 1170.126, subd. (b).) proposition 47 was enacted with only two days remaining in the two-year period for filing proposition 36 petitions. a rational voter would not have understood proposition 47 to change the rules for proposition 36 petitions when the period for filing such petitions had almost expired. on these grounds, we conclude that section 1170.18, subdivision (c) contains a drafting error that must be judicially corrected to read . as so read, to proposition 36. 11 5. e prospectively to proposition 36 petitions filed after proposition 47 was enacted, we nonetheless would conclude it does not apply in this case proposition 36 petition for resentencing was filed and decided before proposition 47 went into effect.3 we agree with the majority of courts that have addressed this issue and conclude that proposition 47 does not apply retroactively. section 3 of the penal code says, retroactive, unless expressly ha[s] described section 3, and its identical counterparts in other codes [citations], as codifying the time-honored principle . . . that in the absence of an express retroactivity provision, a statute will not be applied retroactively unless it is very clear from extrinsic sources that the legislature . . . must have intended a retroactive appeople v. brown (2012) 54 cal.4th 314, 319 (brown), italics added.) proposition 47 and the ballot materials are silent as to the retroactive application. (voter information guide, gen. elec. (nov. 4, 2014), pp. 3439.) thus, there is no cl of arises from the relevant extribrown, supra, 54 cal.4th at p. 320.) furthermore, the rule enunciated in in re estrada (1965) 63 cal.2d 740 (estrada), that statutes that are amended to reduce punishment for particular crimes are intended to apply retroactively, does not apply here. in estrada, the california supreme court stated: when the legislature amends a statute so as to lessen the punishment it has obviously expressly determined that its former penalty was too severe and that a lighter punishment is proper as punishment for the commission of the prohibited act. it is an 3 whether proposition 47 applies retroactively to proceedings under proposition 36 is also currently pending before the california supreme court. (see people v. chaney, supra, 231 cal.app.4th 1391, review granted feb. 18, 2015, s223676.) 12 inevitable inference that the legislature must have intended that the new statute imposing the new lighter penalty now deemed to be sufficient should apply to every case to which it constitutionally could apply . . . [including] acts committed before its passage provided the judgment convicting the def (id. at p. 745.) therefore, rule is that the amendment will operate retroactively so that the lighter punishment is id. at p. 748.) estrada does not apply in this case because applying the definition of of danger resentencing under proposition 36 would not reduce punishment for a particular crime. (see brown, supra, 54 cal.4th at p. 325 [rejecting application of estrada to statute where h respect to a particular criminal offense, and thus does not support an analogous inference rather, it simply changes the lens through which the dangerousness determinations under proposition 36 are made. on these grounds, we of danger to petitioner whose petition for resentencing under proposition 36 was decided before the effective date of proposition 47. 6. section 1170.126, subdivision (g) is not unconstitutionally vague subdivision (f) of section 1170.126 provides that the trial court must exercise its risk of danger to exercising its discretion in subdivision (f), the court may consider: (1) the petitioners criminal conviction history, including the type of crimes committed, the extent of injury to victims, the length of prior prison commitments, and the remoteness of the crimes; s disciplinary record and record of rehabilitation while incarcerated; and 13 (3) any other evidence the court, within its discretion, determines to be relevant in deciding whether a new sentence would result in an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. petitioner contends that orted into proposition 36, then proposition 36 violate[s] due process because [it] fail[s] to give notice of what is required for a finding of dangerousness and invite[s] specifically, petitioner argues that level of risk . . .
