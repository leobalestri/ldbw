 filed 12/23/16 p. v. mosley ca24 not to be published in the official reports california rules of court, rule 8.1115(a), prohibits courts and parties from citing or relying on opinions not certified for publication or ordered published, except as specified by rule 8.1115(b). this opinion has not been certified for publication or ordered published for purposes of rule 8.1115. in the court of appeal of the state of california second appellate district division four the people, plaintiff and respondent, v. byron charles mosely, defendant and appellant. b269711 (los angeles county super. ct. no. ba423092) appeal from a judgment of the superior court of los angeles county, sam ohta, judge. affirmed david m. thompson, under appointment by the court of appeal, for defendant and appellant. kamala d. harris, attorney general, gerald a. engler, chief assistant attorney general, lance e. winters, assistant attorney general, paul m. roadarmel, jr. and william n. frank, deputy attorneys general, for plaintiff and respondent. 2 introduction defendant byron mosely appeals from the judgment entered following his conviction by jury of committing a lewd act upon a child and kidnapping to commit such an act. he contends the trial court erred in admitting evidence of a prior act of uncharged misconduct. he further argues that his sentence on the kidnapping count should have been stayed pursuant to penal code section 654. we find no error and therefore affirm. factual and procedural history i. procedural background the los angeles county district attorney (the people) filed an information on july 24, 2014 charging defendant with committing a lewd act upon a child (pen. code,  288, subd. (a); count one), kidnapping for child molesting (pen. code,  207, subd. (b); count two), and kidnapping to commit another crime, specifically, a lewd act upon a child (pen. code,  209, subd. (b)(1); count three), arising from events occurring on march 28 and 29, 2014. n to dismiss count two. at the conclusion of trial, the jury convicted defendant on counts one and three as charged. the court sentenced defendant to a determinate term of eight years in state prison on count one and a consecutive indeterminate term of seven years to life on count three. defendant timely appealed. ii. prosecution case a. march 28, 2014 incident on march 28, 2014, the victim, kayla c., and her sister were playing at the home of their friend, paris b. kayla was eight years old and paris was about nine years old.1 mother testified that she had known defendant since she was a baby and he 1 the girls testified at trial about twenty-one months later. 3 the kids or around th paris testified that defendant frequently kayla lived with her mother and siblings in the las palmas motel, about two blocks from kayla testified that she asked her mother if she then defendant, paris, and kayla din the building parking lot and sent paris upstairs. paris testified that she kayla did not testify at trial as to any contact with defendant in the van and stated she could not remember certain details about the events of that day. children were being punished. she therefore asked defendant to take kayla home and he agreed. the van, instead of taking her home, defendant drove them to a nearby after leaving the restaurant, kayla fell asleep in the van; she testified that defendant told her he was taking her home, but when she woke up, they were at a motel. kayla asked where they were, and because the van had broken down. she asked to go home and defendant said she followed his directions to exit the van and go into a motel room.2 2 defendant took kayla to the fijian motel, located about six blocks south of her home. the manager of the fijian motel testified that defendant 4 once inside, defendant told kayla to take a bath, which she did. during her bath, defendant walked into th he also told her to put on lotion after the bath, which she did. defendant then left and kayla fell asleep on the bed. she woke up . . . was lying next to her on the bed. he was dressed and lying on top of the blankets. defendant then touched her vagina with his hand over her clothing. later on the morning of march 29, 2014, kayla and defendant walked to her home. kayla told her mother that she had stayed overnight with defendant at a motel. when kayla told her where she had spent the night, they according to ebony b., defendant left with kayla on the evening of march 28, 2014. h11:00 p.m., about one and a half to two hours later. in the interim, she had placed three phone calls and one text to defendant. when defendant arrived, he was alone and returned the van. she asked defendant if he had taken defendant then took his bicycle and a he then left her apartment on his bicycle. b. investigation officers from the los angeles police department (lapd) responded to the 911 call on the morning of march 29, 2014. kayla reportthat he touched her. kayla and defendant were taken to the hospital for filled out a registration card at 10:00 p.m. on march 28, 2014 to rent a motel room for that night. 5 sexual assault examinations. defendant consented to the examination, which involved collection of evidence samples for forensic dna testing. nurse practitioner shamsah barolia conducted a sexual assault examination on kayla on march 29, 2014. during that examination, kayla nto the when kayla came out of the bathroom, defendant was gone, and she fell of children cussing at each other on his kayla further reported that and when she turned away, he kissed the other ear. she also said that he touched me on my private part hurting and red. kayla also m the investigating lapd detective interviewed kayla on march 31, 2014. om. kayla also stated kayla also reported that defendant told her to sit on his examination, barolia collected oral, anal, vestibular, and vulvar swabs.3 3 as nurse barolia explained, the vulvar swabs are taken from the external genital area, and the vestibular swabs are from the inner vaginal area around the urethral opening. 6 anal and vestibular samples, and his dna was detected in her vulvar sample. fbedsheet, and then to a second individual who came in contact with that item. c. prior misconduct incident involving defendant. s.a. testified that she had known defendant since she was born. in 1980 or 1981, her mother often asked defendant to watch her and her younger brother while she worked an overnight shift. at the time, s.a. was four or five years old. her mother would put her to bed he would take off her pajamas and direct s.a. to put her defendant would then remove his clothing, get on she thought at the time he was causing her to urinate on herself. defendant would also touch her vaginal area under her clothing with his hands. s.a. also testified as to other occasions in the presence of family members when defendant would tell her to she did not tell anyone until she was thirteen, after she saw an episode of the oprah winfrey show and realized she was a victim. d. defense defendant did not present any witnesses at trial. in closing, his counsel argued, among other things, that there was circumstantial evidence to support the inference that the van actually was broken. he also argued that he and that defendant lacked the specific intent necessary for count 7 occur until eight or nine hours after they arrived at the motel. discussion i. admission of uncharged acts under section 1108 defendant argues the court erred in admitting the uncharged acts of sexual misconduct against s.a. we conclude the court did not abuse its discretion in admitting s.a.4 a. legal principles as a genof specific instances of uncharged misconduct, is inadmissible to prove the conduct of that person on a specific occasion. ( 1101, subd. (a).) the rule is qualified by section 1101, subdivision (b), which permits admission of evidence of uncharged misconduct when such evidence is relevant to nce in sexual offense cases, section 1108 creates an exception to section 1101's prohibition against propensity evidence. under section 1108, when a section 1101 if not inadmissible under section 352.

( 352.) this determination is entrusted to the sound discretion of the trial judge who is in the best position to evaluate (falsetta, supra, 21 cal.4th at pp. 917-918.) misconduct evidence for abuse of discretion. (see, e.g., people v. kipp (1998) 18 cal.4th 349, 369-371; people v. huy ngoc nguyen (2010) 184 cal.app.4th 1096, 1116 (nguyen).) a trial court's admission of evidence pursuant to showing that the court exercised its discretion in an arbitrary, capricious or patently absurd manner that resulted in a manifest miscarriage of justice. (people v. rodrigues (1994) 8 cal.4th 1060, 1124-1125.) b. factual background prior to trial, the people moved to admit evidence of prior sexual misconduct committed by defendant against s.a. pursuant to sections 1108 and 352. prior incident alleged by s.a. was highly inflammatory, significantly remote in time, and not sufficiently similar to outweigh the factors in favor of exclusion. the trial court proceeded to analyze the issue in detail under sections the probative value of an uncharged act is its 9 specifically, the court noted the following similarities: he befriended; two, the alleged victim is a young female child five years old in the prior offense and eight years old in the instant offense; three, the defendant played a care-taking function to assist the family; and, four, the defendant took advantage of an opportunity to be alone with the alleged victim created by the care- the court also ive value of the prior incident. the court then balanced the probative value against the other relevant factors under section 352. first, it found the uncharged conduct was not [b]oth occasions as opposed to it being a one-5 but found that fact -finding role out of some sort of second, the court found little possibility of confusion of the issues, indicating the jury would be properly instructed as to the use of the prior act evidence. third, considering remoteness of the conduct, the -mitigated by 5 s.a. did not ts, but did state that it was a repeated occurrence. 10 6 which demonstrated -court found that presentation of s.a. admit evidence regarding the prior incident. c. no error in admission of incident as the trial court properly recognized, admission of a prior incident of sexual misconduct requires a careful balancing under section 352 to outweighed by the probability that its admission will [(a)] necessitate undue consumption of time [or (b)] create substantial danger of undue prejudice, of without doubt, evidence a defendant committed an offense on a separate occasion is inherently prejudicial. [citations.] but evidence code section 352 requires the exclusion of evidence only when its probative value is substantially outweighed by its e people v. quang minh tran (nguyen, supra, 184 cal.app.4th at p. 1115.) the factors to be considered by a trial court in conducting a section 352 (nguyen, supra, 184 cal.app.4th at p. 1116.) however, guided by the 6 that case was eventually dismissed after preliminary hearin 11 falsetta, supra, 21 cal.4th at p. 917 (regarding section 1108) and people v. ewoldt (1994) 7 cal.4th 380, 404-406 (regarding section 1101, subdivision (b)), courts have largely considered the following five factors as crucial to admissibility: evidence has probative value, e.g., whether the uncharged conduct is similar enough to the charged behavior to tend to show defendant did in fact commit the charged offense; (2) whether the propensity evidence is stronger and more inflammatory than evidence of the defendant's charged acts; (3) whether the uncharged conduct is remote or stale; (4) whether the propensity evidence is likely to confuse or distract the jurors from their main inquiry, e.g., whether the jury might be tempted to punish the defendant for his uncharged, unpunished conduct; and (5) whether admission of the propensity evidence will require an undue consumption of time. [citation.]. (nguyen, supra, 184 cal.app.4th at pp. 1116-1117; see also people v. branch (2001) 91 cal.app.4th 274, 282; people v. harris (1998) 60 cal.app.4th 727, 738-740.) we address each factor in turn. 1. probative value prior sexual offense is indisputably relevant in a prosecution for another sexual offense. [citation. (people v. branch, supra, 91 cal.app.4th at p. 282; see also falsetta, supra, 21 cal.4th at p. 920 tutes relevant .) (falsetta, supra, 21 cal.4th at p. 917.) s.a. and kayla 12 were young girls, both younger than nine years old at the time of the incident, and in both instances defendant befriended a family with young children, used that friendship to take on a caretaking role over those children, and then used an opportunity created by that caretaking role to be alone with the alleged victim and to sexually molest her. we agree that the acts bear significant similarities. defendant points out that in the current case, he did not befriend the family of the victim (kayla), but rather the family of her friend (paris). however, the record ably supports the trial enabled him to develop a position of trust as to the children and adults in that family and their friends. this position created the opportunity for him to drive kayla home alone. his abuse of that position is remarkably similar to the conduct alleged by s.a. in addition, while the prior conduct involved additional alleged acts, in both instances defendant engaged in sexual fondling of the victim when she was sleeping or had recently awoken.7 further, the probative value of evidence of uncharged misconduct also is independent of the evidence of the (ewoldt, supra, 7 cal. 4th at p. 404; falsetta, supra, 21 cal.4th at p. 917.) here, s.a. was a witness entirely unrelated to the charged offense, thus bolstering the probative value of her testimony. 7 we also note that while there was no testimony as to any skin-to-skin contact between defendant and kayla (as alleged by s.a.), the presence of inference of such contact. 13 2. inflammatory nature defendant next contends that the evidence of the prior conduct was more inflammatory than the testimony regarding the charged conduct. we disagree. defendant notes that the acts alleged by s.a. were more extensive and occurred on a repeated basis. while true, the evidence related to those acts came from the fairly brief testimony of a single, adult witness. by contrast, two young children and their mothers testified as to the events surrounding the charged conduct, along with multiple law enforcement and trauma center witnesses. further, the charged conduct included not only overnight against her wishes. as such, it was not an abuse of discretion for the trial court to conclude that s.a.inflammatory than the evidence supporting the charged conduct. 3. remoteness in time as the trial court acknowledged, there was a substantial time gapover 30 yearsbetween the incident alleged by s.a. and the current offense. time limits have been established for determining when an uncharged offense is so remote as to be inadmissible. . . . [] remoteness of prior offenses [citation.] in theory, a substantial gap between the prior offenses and the charged offenses means that it is less likely that the defendant had the propensity to commit the charged offenses. however, ... significant [citation.] put differently, if the prior offenses are very similar in nature to the charged offenses, the prior offenses have greater 14 (people v. branch, supra, 91 cal.app.4th at pp. 284-285; see also, e.g., people v. frazier (2001) 89 cal.app.4th 30, 41 [15or 16year gap]; people v. soto (1998) 64 cal.app.4th 966, 977, 991-992 [more than a 20year gap].) here, as discussed above, the trial court did not err in determining that the substantial similarity between the two acts sufficiently outweighed the remoteness of the uncharged offense. moreover, the court noted the alleged incident by defendant in 1993 as a factor mitigating the remoteness, as that charged sexual offense. while defendant notes that the only information brief, the trial court was nevertheless entitled to consider this allegation as part of its analysis. under these circumstances, it was unlikely the jury disbelieved the evidence regarding the charged offenses but nevertheless convicted defendant on the strength of s.a.uncharged conduct, or that the jury's passions were inflamed by the evidence of the latter. 4. likelihood of confusion as defendant points out, the likelihood of confusion is increased where, as here, defendant was never charged with or convicted of, the alleged conduct with s.a. (see falsetta, supra, 21 cal.4th at p. 917 [prior conviction lessened to convict the defendant simply to punish him for the other offenses, and that the jury's attention would not be diverted by having to make a separate determination whether defendant commitherefore weighs against admission, although the trial court found the potential prejudice decreased because the jury would be instructed as to the 15 appropriate use of the prior act evidence.8 defendant suggests that s.a. he offers no further explanation or examples. this contention lacks merit, particularly given the fact that the alleged victim testified at trial and was therefore available for cross-examination and that her testimony was limited to the alleged misconduct. 5. consumption of time finally, there was little danger that the presentation of evidence isconduct would require an undue consumption of time. the evidence consisted of the testimony of a single witness, s.a., and was limited to a discussion of the alleged sexual misconduct by defendant against her. thus, the court was well within its discretion to determine that this factor supported admissibility. in sum, we find the trial court did not abuse its discretion in balancing under sections 1108 and 352. ii. multiple punishment defendant contends the trial court erred in refusing to stay his sentence for count three pursuant to penal code section 654. we disagree. penal code section 654, subdivision (a), provides: that is punishable in different ways by different provisions of law shall be punished under the provision that provides for the longest potential term of imprisonment, but in no case shall the act or omission be punished under in the seminal decision interpreting this statute, divisible and therefore gives rise to more than one act within the meaning of 8 the jury was so instructed, using caljic 2.50.01. 16 section 654 depends on the intent and objective of the actor. if all of the offenses were incident to one objective, the defendant may be punished for (neal v. state of california (1960) 55 cal.2d 11, 19 (neal), overruled in part on another ground as stated in people v. correa (2012) 54 cal.4th 331.) while the forth in neal judicial glossengrafted onto section 654,[w]ess declined to expressly overrule it. (people v. latimer (1993) 5 cal.4th 1203, 1211, 1215-1216 (latimer).) neal have limited the rule's application in various ways. some have narrowly interpreted the length of time the defendant had a specific objective, and thereby found similar but consecutive objectives permitting multiple punishment. (e.g., people v. harrison [1989] 48 cal.3d [321,] 334-338 [multiple sex crimes each have the separate objective of achieving additional sexual gratification]; people v. perez [1979] 23 cal.3d [545,] 551-554 [similar]; people v. trotter (1992) 7 cal.app.4th 363, (latimer, supra, 5 cal.4th at pp. 1211-1212.) one line of cases, cited by the attorney general here, relies on the although directed to one objective, may give rise to multiple violations and (people v. beamon (1973) 8 cal.3d 625, 639, fn. 11, disapproved on another ground in people v. mendoza (2000) 23 cal.4th 896.) under these objective does not necessarone indivisible course of conduct for purposes of section 654. if the offenses were committed 17 on different occasions, they may be punished separately. (people v. goode (2015) 243 cal.app.4th 484, 492-493.) often, divisibility turns on whether the defendant had an opportunity (people v. kwok (1998) 63 cal.app.4th 1236, 1254-1255 [permitting punishment for burglary that was committed with the intent to facilitate subsequent crimes]; people v. massie (1967) 66 cal.2d 899, 908.) where the defendants' acts are to renew his or her intent before committing the next [offense], thereby (people v. gaio (2000) 81 cal.app.4th 919, 935.) defendant relies on another line of cases springing from the language in neal, supra, 55 cal.offenses were incident to one objective, the defendant may be punished for any one such offenses but not for more than these cases apply penal code section 654 to bar multiple punishment for an offense such as kidnapping and a second offense, where the kidnapping was done for the purpose of committing the second offense. (see, e.g., latimer, supra, 5 cal.4th at p.1216; people v. jackson (1995) 32 cal.app.4th 411, 414 [staying punishment for kidnapping e of committing a sexual offense, provided the sexual offense was punished and the acts comprised an people v. burns (1984) 158 cal.app.3d 1178, 1181; people v. galvan (1986) 187 cal.app.3d 1205, 1219.) series of offenses is for the trial court, and the law gives the trial court broad latitude in making this determination. its findings on this question must be 18 upheld o(people v. hutchins (2001) 90 cal.app.4th 1308, 1312.) defendant urges that we should bar punishment on the kidnapping count. because he was convicted of kidnapping with the specific intent to commit lewd conduct, he argues that the kidnapping was necessarily done with the same intent and objective as the subsequent lewd conduct however, the trial court concluded that penal code section 654 did not bar punishment on both counts, relying on t accordingly, the court found the two crimes were stwo crimes were divisible, rather than a continuous course of conduct, and thus subject to separate punishment. crucially, not only were the crimes separated by many hours, but defendant left the motel, returned the van to bicycle. as such, the court was entitled to find that defendant had the opportunity to reflect and to renew his intent prior to the second offense, creating a separate risk of harm upon his return to the motel and initiation of the lewd contact with kayla. these circumstances distinguish this case from the kidnapping cases cited by defendant, which applied penal code section 654 to a continuous course of conduct between the kidnapping and the assault. (see, e.g., latimer, supra, 5 cal.4th at p. 1206 [defendant kidnapped victim, drove her into the desert, then raped her]; people v. flores (1987) 193 cal.app.3d 915, 917 [defendant kidnapped child, took him to motel room, and sexually assaulted him].) 19 evidence to establish that his lewd conduct occurred in the early morning on march 29, 2014, and thus many hours after the kidnapping began. the -hour time gap was supported by touched her after she woke up early the next morning. we therefore conclude that substantial evidence supports the trial disposition affirmed. not to be published in the official reports collins, j. we concur: willhite, acting p. j. manella, j.
