(a)). the people further alleged that he had served a prison term for his 2012 conviction for possession of a controlled substance. (pen. code,  667.5, subd. (b).) defendant moved to suppress the drugs found in his truck. following an evidentiary hearing, the trial court denied the motion. the court reasoned that the deputies had three lawful bases for stopping defendantthe expired registration tags, the dark window tinting, and his failure to signal. although the sticker deputy ruiz found last two bases windows, and found that it was he window is very, very the court then noted that officer ruiz could, with the aid of his flashlight, see the baggies and open container of alcohol in plain view. the court upheld the search because there was probable cause to search the vehicle and because the deputies had learned that defendant was on probation before starting the search. defendant proceeded to trial by jury, and was convicted on all counts. the trial court sentenced defendant to three years in jail on the transporting count; the court stayed a two-year sentence on the possession for sale count under penal code section 654.2 defendant timely appeals. 1 miranda v. arizona (1966) 384 u.s. 436. 2 it is unclear from the record what happened with the prior prison term allegation, although the trial court did not impose any sentence for it. 4 discussion defendant argues that the trial court wrongly denied his motion to suppress. a defendant may seek suppression of evidence search is conducted without a warrant, the people have the burden of establishing that the search is constitutionally valid. (people v. redd (2010) 48 cal.4th 691, 719.) in reviewing findings by reviewing them for substantial evidence (ibid.) but do not defer to its conclusions as to whether the search was lawful (ibid.; people v. durant (2012) 205 cal.app.4th 57, 62record (durant, at p. 62; in re rafael c. (2016) 245 cal.app.4th 1288, 1300, fn. 5), unless it is a ground on which additional evidence could have been adduced (robey v. superior court (2013) 56 cal.4th 1218, 1242; green v. superior court (1985) 40 cal.3d 126, 137-138). we will apply these standards to each of the three acts defendant challengesnamely, the lawfulness of (1) the initial stop of his truck, (2) his detention, and (3) the search of his truck. i. stop of truck under the fourth amendment, law enforcement officers may stop a motorist if they have probable cause or reasonable suspicion to believe that the driver has violated the law. (people v. evans (2011) 200 cal.app.4th 735, 743 (evans) [probable cause]; people v. wells (2006) 38 cal.4th 1078, 1082 [reasonable suspicion].) in this case, the deputies had probable cause and reasonable suspicion to believe that defendant had violated three laws: (1) the law requiring valid vehicle registration (veh. code,  5200-5205.5); (2) color or reduces the light transmittance of the wveh. code,  26708 & veh. code,  22107). 5 although the presence of the registration extensiofirst basis for the stop (e.g., people v. celis (2004) 33 cal.4th 667, 674-675 [stop may last their suspicions that justified the stop]), the remaining two bases remained valid. with respect to tinting, courts are (people v. niebauer , very review of the photographs of the windows. defendant argues that there was no proof that did not people v. logsdon (2008) 164 cal.app.4th 741, 744; people v. suff (2014) 58 cal.4th 1013, 1055-1056.) ii. detention of defendant under the fourth amendment, law enforcement officers may effect a warrantless arrest of a person upon a showing of probable cause to believe that they have committed a public offense, even if that offense is a misdemeanor punishable only by a fine. (people v. mckay (2002) 27 cal.4th 601, 605; atwater v. city of lago vista (2001) 532 it were an arrest, the deputies had probable cause to believe that defendant had committed the misdemeanor of having an open container of alcohol in the truck. (veh. code,  23222, subd. (a); pen. code,  17, subd. (a) [offense not designated as an infraction or felony is a misdemeanor].) iii. search of truck under the fourth amendment, law enforcement officers may lawfully search a vehicle without a warrant in a number of circumstances. under the so-search a vehicle when he or she has probable cause to believe it contains contraband or people v. waxler (2014) 224 cal.app.4th 712, 715-716.) in this 6 case, we agree with the trial court that the deputies had probable cause to believe that ntraband and evidence of a crime). by the time they searched the car, they knew defendant had baggies indicative of narcotics transactions in his truck and also knew that he was on probation for a narcotics-related crime. each is relevant to show probable cause. (e.g., people v. sandoval (1985) 164 cal.app.3d 958, 965 [drug paraphernalia provides probable cause to search vehicle for drugs]; people v. aho record always has been considered releva defendant argues that the search was not a valid search incident to arrest (evans, supra, 200 cal.app.4th at p. 745, quoting davis v. united states (2011) 564 u.s. 229, 235), or a valid probation search (people v. schmitz (2012) 55 cal.4th 909, 918). we need not decide these issues because the validity of the automobile exception is sufficient ruling. disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. , j. hoffstadt we concur: , acting p.j. ashmann-gerst , j. chavez
