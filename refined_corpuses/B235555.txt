(stogner v. california, supra, 539 u.s. at pp. 618-619.) b. evidence of an uncharged offense against jane doe 3 on june 14, 2011, the prosecution moved to admit evidence that defendant committed an uncharged sexual offense against jane doe 3. defendant objected that the evidence would be unduly prejudicial under evidence code section 352. the trial court reserved making a ruling, but indicated it would entertain a later hearing to determine if jane doe 3 should be permitted to testify. jane doe 3 ultimately appeared at trial and testified, without objection, that defendant molested her on one occasion for 10 to 15 minutes when she was five or six years old. that date has been or is hereafter convicted of the attempt to commit any of the above- 6 disagree. which the defendancommission of another sexual offense or offenses is not made inadmissible by section conduct on a specified occasion], if the evidence is not inadmissible pursuant to section disposition to people v. reliford (2003) 29 cal.4th 1007, 1009.) (id. at pp. 1012-1013.) remoteness, the degree of certainty of its commission and the likelihood of confusing, misleading, or distracting the jurors from their main inquiry, its similarity to the charged offense, its likely prejudicial impact on the jurors, the burden on the defendant in defending against the uncharged offenses, and the availability of less prejudicial alternatives to its outright admission, such as admitting some but not all of the section 1108 is subject to people v. loy (2011) 52 cal.4th 46, 61.) on will . . . create substantial danger . . substantially outweigh[s] its probative value concerning the charged and other matters relevant to the determination of the charge. as with other 7 forms of relevant evidence that are not subject to any exclusionary principle, the id. at p. 62.) ual offense against jane doe 3 was justification for adopting section 1108 was a practical one: by their very nature, sex crimes are usually committed in seclusion without third party witnesses or substantial corroborating evidence. the ensuing trial often presents conflicting versions of the event and requires the trier of fact to make difficult credibility determinations. section 1108 provides the trier of fact people v. falsetta (1999) 21 cal.4th 903, 915.) waited so long to come forward and could they accurately interpret events that occurred against jane doe 3 assisted the jury in assessing the credibility of jane does 1 and 2 by providcommit sex crimes. the incident involving jane doe 3 and the offenses against jane does 1 and 2 were similar in many respects. they each involved sexual acts against defendaand each woman testified defendant fondled her vagina and obtained an erection. this moreover, the evidence was presented with only one witness and did not consume undue time at trial, and the court instructed the jury to consider the evidence only for the was admonished not to consider it for any other purpose.3 3 the trial court instructed the jury under calcrim no. 1191 on the preponderance-of-the-evidence standard of proof necessary for the prior sexual offenses and the committed the crime of lewd act upon a child that was not charged in this case. this 8 c. accusations that jane doe 2 had an affair with her stepfather d in a sexual relationship relationship with her stepfather. the court stated it would reserve ruling on the issue to give defense counsel a chance to get the facts. however, it does not appear defense counsel revisited the matter. y accusations of an affair between jane doe 2 and her presume defendant means the trial court erred in excluding the evidence. the contention is without merit because the trial court did not exclude evidence of a sexual relationship between jane doe 2 and her stepfather, but rather reserved ruling on its admissibility until defense counsel could develop such evidence. defense counsel never did. crime is defined for you in these instructions. [] you may consider this evidence only if the people have proved by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant in fact committed the uncharged offense. proof by a preponderance of the evidence is a different burden of proof from proof beyond a reasonable doubt. a fact is proved by a preponderance of the evidence if you conclude that it is more likely than not that the fact is true. [] if the people have not met this burden of proof, you must disregard this evidence entirely. [] if you decide that the defendant committed the uncharged offenses, you may, but are not required to, conclude from that evidence that the defendant was disposed or inclined to commit sexual offenses, and based on that decision, also conclude that the defendant was likely to commit and did commit lewd act upon a child, as charged here. if you conclude that the defendant committed the uncharged offense, that conclusion is only one factor to consider along with all the other evidence. it is not sufficient by itself to prove that the defendant is guilty of lewd act upon a child. the people must still prove each charge beyond a reasonable doubt. [] do not consider this 9 d. sufficiency of the evidence because jane does 1 and 2 lacked credibility. at the preliminary hearing, jane doe 2 testified defendant had intercourse with her 8 to 10 times. at trial, she first testi-hundred times. jane doe 1 admitted that when her mother first asked her whether defendant had molested her, she lied and said he had not. furthermore, her testimony that defendant took her into his bedroom where he molested her contradicted the testimony of some of her cousins, who were in the house at the time and said they noticed nothing. defendant argues these inconsistencies demonstrate the testimony of jane does 1 and 2 was not credible or of solid value. he also notes that the prosecution lacked vidence is challenged on appeal, the court must review the whole record in the light most favorable to the judgment to determine whether it contains substantial evidencei.e., evidence that is credible and of solid valuefrom which a rational trier of fact could have found the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable people v. jennings undertaking such review, our opinion that the evidence could reasonably be reconciled with a finding of innocence or a lesser degree of crime does not warrant a reversal of the people v. hill (1998) 17 cal.4th 800, 849.) acts constituting [sexual crimes committed] upon or with the body, or any part or member thereof, of a child who is under the age of 14 years, with the intent of arousing, appealing subd. (a).) it defines continuous abuse of a child as engaging in three or more acts of substantial sexual conduct with a child under the age of 14 years with whom the perpetrator resides or to whom the perpetrator has recurring access. ( 288.5, subd. (a).) 10 evidence of guilt included the testimony of three by-then mature women who were able to relate in some detail sexual experiences with defendant that occurred years earlier and were strikingly similar. jane doe 2 testified she was abused from the time she was nine years old until she was eleven. several times a week defendant would remove her clothing, fondle her vagina, force her to orally copulate him, and have vaginal intercourse with her. jane doe 2 testified defendant had intercourse with her more than 100 times from 1996 to 1999. jane doe 1 testified defendant several times removed her clothing and fondled her vagina for 20 or 30 minutes. both women testified defendant obtained an erection and the abuse occurred while they were in his house, away from their parents, and under his supervision and control. this evidence supported the convictions. the inconsistencies and deficiencies to which defendant alludes were considered by the jury and resolved against defendant. that the evidence could also have been consistent with defenda e. the length of jury deliberation did not violate due process defendant asserts without elaboration or citation to apposite authority that the one hour and twenty minutesshocks the conscience and raises an inference that his rights to due process and an impartial jury were violated. we see no reason in this case why the testimony and evidence produced at trail necessitated more than 80 minutes of deliberation by the jury. there only were two main witnesses, and their testimony was neither complex nor lengthy. the defense evidence was equally simple and brief, and jury instructions were uncomplicated. the only real task was to decide whom to believe. under these circumstances, we cannot conclude tdeliberations were overly brief. 11 disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published. chaney, j. we concur: rothschild, acting p. j. johnson, j.
