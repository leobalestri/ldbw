filed 9/15/16 p. v. romero ca2/1 not to be published in the official reports california rules of court, rule 8.1115(a), prohibits courts and parties from citing or relying on opinions not certified for publication or ordered published, except as specified by rule 8.1115(b). this opinion has not been certified for publication or ordered published for purposes of rule 8.1115. in the court of appeal of the state of california second appellate district division one the people, plaintiff and respondent, v. salvio romero, defendant and appellant. b264888 (los angeles county super. ct. no. na098451) appeal from a judgment of the superior court of los angeles county, tomson t. ong, judge. affirmed. salvio romero, in pro. per.; and theresa osterman stevenson, under appointment by the court of appeal, for defendant and appellant. no appearance for plaintiff and respondent. 2 a jury convicted salvio romero (romero) of failing to register as a sex offender (pen. code,1  290.013, subd. (a)) and the court subsequently sentenced him to seven years in state prison. on appeal, romero argues that this court should reverse his conviction because, inter alia, he was (a) subjected to double jeopardy and/or (b) denied the effective assistance of counsel. we disagree and, accordingly, affirm the judgment. background i. prior convictions as a sex offender in 2002, romero was convicted of two counts of committing a lewd act against a child under the age of 14/15 ( 288, subd. (c)(1)) and two counts of oral copulation with a person under the age of 14. in 2005, romero was convicted of two counts of indecent exposure in public ( 314, subd. (1)). in 2007, romero was convicted of four counts of exposing his private parts in public ( 314, subd. (1). in 2008, romero was convicted of four counts of indecent exposure in public ( 314, subd. (1)). as a result of these convictions, the law required romero to register with local law enforcement as a sex offender. ii. nviction for failure to register as a sex offender a. long beach registration requirements for sex offenders when a registrant first moves into the city of long beach, he or she has five days to initially register as a sex offender. if a registrant maintains a stable address within the city, he or she must reregister once a year, within five days before or after his or her birthday. if a registrant is a transient, then he or she must register with law enforcement every 30 days. if a person has more than one residence, he or she must register both addresses. if a registrant moves out of the city of long beach, the registrant must or her new residence. form 8102 used by the long beach police department spells out all of these 1 all further statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise indicated. 3 registration obligations to sex offenders. in addition to registering, all paroled sex offenders living within the city of long beach must wear around their ankle a global positioning system (gps) monitoring device breaking the plastic binders that hold the band into the gps unit. b. on july 23, 2013, the parole agent assigned to supervise romero personally kle. on october 3, 2013, romero registered with the long beach police department, reporting that he currently resided at one address: 2426 wardlow (the wardlow address). the wardlow address is a housing unit for parolees address because it was hard for romero to find housing. romero moved to the wardlow address in september 2013 and paid rent for the month of september. on october 20, 2013, long beach parole officers, assisted by long beach police officers, conducted a registration compliance check of romero.2 the veritracks system for the gps ankle bracelet showed romero to be at an apartment complex at 1575 chestnut avenue in long beach (the chestnut address). at the chestnut address, the parole officers located inside in a brown paper bag in a shopping cart, in front of one of the apartmentsbut they were unable to find romero, even though they knocked on every door of the complex. residents at the apartment complex told the parole officers that they did not know romero and had not seen him. unable to find romero at the chestnut address, the parole officers went to officers were unable to find romero. the officers spoke with other parolees living there and the manager of the residence about romero. 2 athat on october 20, 2013, long beach parole officers were also investigating a complaint 4 in late october 2013, after learning that romero had cut off his gps ankle bracelet, the manager of the wardlow address the wardlow address. in late october and again in mid-november 2013, romero called the manager of the wardlow address asking about his possessions and how he might reclaim them. on november 13, 2013, in a subsequent follow-up visit to the wardlow address, a ommate, who at the time had been living at the wardlow address for approximately a month. c. conviction and sentencing on march 17, 2014, the court held a preliminary hearing. at the preliminary hearing, the people relied on the testimony of the investigating detective who had gone to the court found that there was sufficient evidence to hold romero for failing to register a change of address in compliance with section 290.013, subdivision (a). romeronment occurred on april 1, 2014, at which time romero pled not guilty to the single count information.3 on may 22, 2014, the people filed a first amended information, adding additional allegations regarding prior felony convictions. on may 27, 2015, romero pled not guilty to the single count amended information and, although he felt that his court-appointed attorney was ineffective, romero nonetheless withdrew his marsden4 motion to discharge his attorney. the trial until june 2, 2014, so that his counsel could further investigate information provided by a new witness. on june 2, 2014, the first day of trial, the couto 3 according to documents submitted with his supplemental brief, romero 4 people v. marsden (1970) 2 cal.3d 118. 5 dismiss the information due to insufficient evidence at the preliminary hearing. the court [b]ased upon the information presented to the magistrate in this . . . case, ause to prove each and every element of the charge . . . on june 3, 2014, after less than an hour of deliberation, the jury found romero guilty of failing to update his sex offender registration with a change of address. on june 4, 2014, the jury found rior convictions. on july 2, 2014, the court sentenced romero to seven years in prison. d. appeal on june 24, 2015, this court granted romero leave to file a belated notice of appeal, which he did on june 25, 2015. on september 28, 2015 and again on december 31, 2015, we appointed counsel to represent romero, and, on may 2, 2016, after examining the record, counsel filed an opening brief raising no issues and asking this court to review independently the record in this case. on may 5, 2016, we advised romero that he had 30 days in which to submit any contentions or issues that he wished us to consider. on june 30, 2016, we grantfor an extension of time to file a supplemental brief. obrief. discussion claims in his supplemental brief fall into two basic categories. the first group of claims are those that are flatly contradicted by the record. for example, he contends that he never entered a plea to the first amended information or consented to setting trial more than 60 days beyond the april 1, 2014 arraignment date. however, the transcript from the may 27, 2014 hearing is clearwithdrew his marsden motion, stated on the record that his client was entering a plea of not guilty (a plea that was reaffirmed on june 2, 2014, at the start of trial) and was requesting a short continuance beyond the 60-day deadline, a request that the court granted. similarly, romero contends that the operative information incorrectly alleged a juvenile adjudication and further contends (in a wholly conclusory manner) that this 6 adjudication was never proved beyond a reasonable doubt. flatly belied by the record: the earliest prior conviction alleged in the amended information is a drug-related conviction in 1993 when romero was 22 years old. moreover, at the bifurcated proceeding on the prior convictions, the people produced a certified abstract of judgment for the 1993 conviction. at the trial on the prior convictionsan abstract of judgment for another conviction, there was no challenge whatsoever to the accuracy of the abstract of judgment for the 1993 convictionno cross-regarding the 1993 conviction, no defense witnesses or documentary evidence contesting the conviction or the accuracy of the abstract of judgment. finding on the 1993 conviction was based on undisputed evidence that the jury could and did find credible. the second group of claims, as discussed below, are those that cannot be evaluated properly on the record before us.5 i. claim romero contends he has been subject to double jeopardy and/or denied a speedy trial. more specifically, romero claims that a prior case involving the same exact charge was brought against him and then dismissed (no. na097541).6 romero contends that 5 romero does make one other argument that does not fall into either category. in a single, short sentence at the very end of his supplemental brief, romero challenges the under well-established principles ellant must present meaningful legal analysis supported by citations to authority and citations to facts in the record that support the claim of error. [citations.] when a point is asserted without argument and authority in re s.cargument about the ruling on his 995 motion is so completely conclusory, we decline to review it. 6 according to documents submitted by romero with his supplemental brief, it appears that the court held a preliminary hearing in na097541 on december 18, 2013 and, based on the evidence presented, found 7 because na097541 was dismissed due to delay, the instant case was and is barred by the doctrine of double jeopardy. this argument does not appear to have any legal merit. first, while it is true that, once jeopardy attaches, a dismissal of a case will bar retrial on the same charges (see larios v. superior court (1979) 24 cal.3d 324, 328329; curry v. superior court (1970) 2 cal.3d 707, 712), it is not at all clear on the record before us that jeopardy ever attached in na097541. a defendant is in jeopardy only when he or she is placed on trial for an offense, on a valid indictment or information or other accusatory pleading, before a competent court, and with a competent jury, duly impaneled, sworn, and charged with the case. (see jackson v. superior court (1937) 10 cal.2d 350, 352, 355; people v. pitts (1990) 223 cal.app.3d 606, 877878 [same], superseded by statute on other grounds as stated in people v. levesque (1995) 35 cal.app.4th 530, 537.) in addition, the timely refiling of charges once dismissed for denial of a speedy trial has been deemed constitutionally permissible absent a showing by the accused of actual prejudice. (see crockett v. superior court (1975) 14 cal.3d 433, 437; see also paredes v. superior court (1999) 77 cal.app.4th 24, 28 [felony case dismissed once for delay can be refiled]; people v. lilliock (1968) 265 cal.app.2d 419, 435 [same], overruled on another point in people v. flood (1998) 18 cal.4th 470.) here, there is no evidence that a jury was ever sworn in na097541. indeed, the only documents we have from na097541 are those relating to its commencementthe transcript of the preliminary hearing and the subsequent information; we have no records regarding how or why na097541 was dismissed or otherwise resolved. in other words, the record before us does not allow us to determine whether jeopardy attached in na097541. (see generally hotels nevada, llc v. l.a. pacific center, inc. (2012) 203 cal.app.4th 336, 348.) second, even assuming, arguendo, that the record before us was complete with romero failed to register in a timely manner as a sex offender. an information, signed on december 26, 2013, was apparently filed on january 2, 2013. 8 regard to na097541, romero has not established how the refiling of the failure to register charges on april 1, 2014 actually prejudiced him. (crockett v. superior court, supra, 14 cal.3d at p. 437 defendant is burdened with the obligation to demonstrate that he is prejudicedprejudice occurs where the delay impedes presentation of evidence in the defense case. (people v. hernandez (1992) 6 cal.app.4th 1355, 1359.) accordingly, because romero has not provided an adequate record nor explained how the delay between na097541 and the trial in the instant case compromised his defense, we decline to consider his double jeopardy claim. ii. ineffective assistance of counsel claims. for example, romero variously argues that his attorney failed to (a) file a motion to dismiss based on his double jeopardy claim, (b) present evidence that he was at home on october 20, 2013, (c) present evidence that he had turned himself into the authorities on november 5, 2013, (d) challenge the amended exact date when the offense was committed, and (e) impeach certain witnesses. as discussed below, we decline to review these claims. to prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, defendant must establish that his or s representation fell below professional standards of reasonableness and must affirmatively establish prejudice. (strickland v. washington (1984) 466 u.s. 668, 687; people v. hart (1999) 20 cal.4th 546, 623624.) if the s showing is insufficient as to one component of this claim, we need not address the other. (strickland, at p. 697.) however, [a] claim on appeal of ineffective assistance of counsel must be ct in the manner challenged[,] . . . unless counsel was asked for an explanation and failed to provide one, or unless there simply could [citations.] unless the record affirmatively discloses that counsel had no tactical purpose for his act corpus proceedings at which evidence dehors the record may be taken to determine the 9 (people v. hinds (2003) 108 cal.app.4th 897, 901.) as our supreme court observed in people v. mendoza tello (1997) 15 cal.4th 264habeas corpus proceeding, the rules generally prohibiting raising an issue on habeas corpus that was, or could have been, raised on appeal [citations] would not bar an (id. at p. 267.) in mendoza tello, the supreme court unanimously reversed the court of as conviction on the grounds that counsel was ineffective for failing to make a suppression motion; the court did so due to gaps in the record: deputy gomez would have said had he been asked at a suppression hearing why he did what he did. . . . [p]erhaps he did have a reason, of which defense counsel was aware, perhaps there was some other reason not to (ibid.) deputy] the opportunity to point to any specific and articulable facts justifying his actions. nor did the prosecution have the (ibid.) the lesson from people v. mendoza tello, supra, 15 cal.4th 264, is that an all the relevant facts (id. at p. 267, italics added.) or, as the court in people v. hinds, supra, 108 cal.app.4th 897, put it, aspersions on counsel when counsel is not in a position to defend his conduct. a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel instead is more appropriately made in a habeas corpus (id. at p. 902.) accordingly, we decline to review ineffectiveness of counsel claims because the record does not contain any explanation for his necessarily rule out a satisfactory one. thus, while we affirm the judgment, we do so [romero] may have to relief by way of a petition for writ (people v. garrido (2005) 127 cal.app.4th 359, 367.) 10 in sum, we have examined the entire record before us and are satisfied that ed appellate counsel fully complied with her responsibilities and that no arguable issues currently exist. (people v. kelly (2006) 40 cal.4th 106, 109110; people v. wende (1979) 25 cal.3d 436, 441.) disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published. johnson, j. we concur: rothschild, p. j. chaney, j.
