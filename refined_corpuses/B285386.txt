(b); count two). the prosecutor alleged that marshall personally used a firearm in the commission of the robbery ( 12022.53, subd. (b)) and personally used a firearm in the commission of the assault ( 12022.5, subd. (a)). the prosecutor further alleged that marshall had suffered a prior conviction of assault with a firearm ( 245, subd. (a)(2)), constituting a strike under the three strikes law ( 667, subds. (b)-(j), 1170.12) and a serious felony ( 667, subd. (a)), and had suffered five prior convictions, serving prior prison terms for 4 those offenses, and did not remain free of prison custody for a period of five years after the conclusion of each term ( 667.5, subd. (b)). ~ on january 18, 2017, the district attorney amended the information by changing count two to assault with a firearm ( 245, subd. (a)(2)). 3. the verdict and sentencing the jury convicted marshall of both counts and found that the allegations of firearm use were true. marshall admitted the prior strike conviction and the five prior convictions and prison terms, and the trial court found that those allegations were true. on august 24, 2017, the trial court sentenced marshall to a total of 27 years in prison, consisting of the middle term of six years on count two as the base count, doubled to 12 years under the three strikes law, plus four years for the firearm enhancement ( 12022.5, subd. (a)); 16 months on count one (one-third of the middle term), doubled to 32 months under the three strikes law, plus three years, four months for the firearm enhancement ( 12022.53, subd. (b)); and five years for the prior serious felony ( 667, subd. (a)(1)). the court imposed and stayed a one-year term for the prior prison term related to the prior serious felony ( 667.5, subd. (d)) and struck the remaining four prior prison terms pursuant to section 1385. discussion the case must be remanded for resentencing a. the firearm enhancements trial court had no authority to strike a firearm enhancement under sections 12022.2 or 12022.53. former section 12022.5, 5 subdivision (c) expressly precluded striking a firearm enhancement under section 12022.5, and former section 12022.53, subdivision (h) expressly precluded striking a firearm enhancement under section 12022.53. (stats. 2010, ch. 711, 5). as amended by senate bill 620 (2017-2018 reg. sess.), effective january 1, 2018,3 section 12022.5, subdivision (c) and section 12022.53, subdivision (h) now give the sentencing court the discretion to strike a firearm enhancement in the interest of justice pursuant to section 1385.4 in re estrada (1965) 63 cal.2d 740 held that, absent evidence to the contrary, the court must presume the legislature intended any statutory amendment mitigating punishment for a particular crime to apply retroactively to all defendants whose judgments were not yet final on the operative date of the amendment.5 (id. at pp. 747748; see brown, supra, 54 cal.4th at p. 324 [estrada 3 statutes enacted at a regular session go into effect on january 1 of the following year. (cal. const., art. iv,  8, subd. (c)(1).) 4 as amended, sections 12022.5, subdivision (c) and the court may, in the interest of justice pursuant to section 1385 and at the time of sentencing, strike or dismiss an enhancement otherwise required to be imposed by this section. the authority provided by this subdivision applies to any resentencing that may occur pursuant to any other law. 5 the estrada rule is an exception to the general rule that penal statutes are presumed to operate prospectively only unless expressly stated otherwise. ( 3; see people v. brown (2012) 54 cal.4th 314, 324 (brown).) 6 a legislative act mitigating the punishment for a particular criminal the estrada rule applies not only to amendments reducing the penalty for a crime, but also to amendments giving the court discretion to impose a lesser penalty. (people v. francis (1969) 71 cal.2d 66, 76.) the estrada rule applies here because section 12022.5, subdivision (c) and section 12022.53, subdivision (h), as amended, give the trial court the discretion to impose a lesser sentence by striking firearm enhancements, and the amendment became effective before this case became final on appeal. there is no indication the legislature intended the amendments to apply prospectively only. (people v. woods (2018) 19 cal.app.5th 1080, 1090-1091.) the people concede the estrada rule applies and the amendments apply retroactively. [citation.] a court which is unaware of the scope of its discretionary powers can no more appropriate remedy is to remand for resentencing unless the people v. gutierrez (2014) 58 cal.4th 1354, 1391.) the people here do not contend the trial court would have declined to strike the firearm enhancements if it had the discretion to strike the enhancements at the time of sentencing. 7 accordingly, the trial court must be given the opportunity to decide whether to exercise its discretion under sections 12022.5, subdivision (c) and 12022.53, subdivision (h), as amended. on remand, the court may reconsider the total sentence and impose a new sentence, subject to the limitation that the new sentence cannot exceed the original sentence. (people v. lai (2006) 138 cal.app.4th 1227, 1245 [directed the the court may reconsider the total sentence, and fashion a new sentence, so long as the new aggregate, non-stayed term does not exceed the original seven-year sentencepeople v. savala (1983) 147 cal.app.3d 63, 68as a series of separate independent terms, but rather must be viewed as one prison term made up of interdependent components . . . [] [w]hen we ordered the court to set aside the first judgment and to resentence defendant the court was entitled to reconsider all of its sentencing choices, subject only to the limitation that defendant not be sentenced to a greater aggregate term than the firs b. the assault sentence section 245, subdivision (a)(2) provides a sentencing range of two, three, or four years for assault with a firearm, so the middle term is three years. the trial court mistakenly imposed a middle term of six yearconviction.6 this was error, and the sentence was unauthorized. (people v. roth (2017) 17 cal.app.5th 694, 702703 [ a sentence is generally unauthorized where it could not lawfully be 6 assault with a semiautomatic firearm, alleged in the original information, carries a middle term of six years. ( 245, subd. (b).) 8 imposed under any circumstance in the particular case, and commonly occurs where the court violates mandatory provisions governing the length of confinement], quoting people v. scott (1994) 9 cal.4th 331, 354.) as with the firearm enhancements, we believe the trial court should be given the opportunity to resentence marshall fully aware of its sentencing discretion. the court may reconsider the total sentence and impose a new sentence, subject to the limitation that the new sentence cannot exceed the original sentence. (people v. lai, supra, 138 cal.app.4th at p. 1245; people v. savala, supra, 147 cal.app.3d at pp. 6869.) disposition the judgment of conviction is affirmed, the sentence is vacated, and the matter is remanded for resentencing in accordance with the views expressed in this opinion. not to be published in the official reports micon, j.* we concur: manella, p. j. collins, j. *judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
