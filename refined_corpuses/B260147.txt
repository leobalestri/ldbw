(b)-(d)), and alleged that sarukhanyan used a firearm in the commission of this offense within the meaning of section 1203.06, subdivision (a)(1) and section 12022.5, subdivision (a). the information alleged that the base murder charge and the 4 firearm enhancements were serious felonies pursuant to section 1192.7, subdivision (c)(8), and violent felonies within the meaning of section 667.5, subdivision (c)(8). sarukhanyan was charged with a second count of drawing or exhibiting a firearm in the presence of a motor vehicle occupant, in violation of section 417.3. sarukhanyan pled not guilty to both counts. sarukhanyan subsequently made a marsden motion, which was heard and denied. (people v. marsden (1970) 2 cal.3d 118.) sarukhanyan second marsden motion also was denied. on september 18, 2014, sarukhanyan entered into a plea agreement whereby he agreed to plead guilty to one count of second degree murder ( 187, subd. (a)) and admit a firearm allegation ( 12022.53, subd. (d)). the plea agreement provided for a term of 15 years to life plus a consecutive term of 25 years to life for the firearm enhancement, for a total of 40 years to life. the charged violation of section 417.3 was dismissed. the court ordered sarukhanyan to pay various fees and restitution. on november 13, 2014, sarukhanyan filed his timely notice of appeal, in which he sought to appeal the 25-year sentencing enhancement he received pursuant to section 12022.53, subdivision (d). sarukhanyan did not receive a certificate of probable cause. -appointed counsel filed an opening brief asking this court to review the record independently pursuant to the holding of people v. wende (1979) 25 cal.3d 436, 441 (wende). sarukhanyan was informed of his right to file a supplemental brief with the court. no supplemental brief has been filed. discussion appellant claims that the trial court wrongfully imposed a 25-year sentencing enhancement pursuant to section 12022.53, subdivision (d). however, 5 appellant agreed to this particular sentence as part of his plea agreement. before entering his plea, appellant was informed by the prosecuting attorney that he was with an additional and consecutive term of 25 years to life for personal use and the plea agreement, pled guilty to one count of second degree murder, and admitted pursuant to section 12022.53, subdivision (d), that he personally and intentionally discharged a firearm, causing the death of another. a certificate of probable cause is required for an appeal challenging the validity of a plea agreement. (people v. brown (2010) 181 cal.app.4th 356, 359; see also  1237.5.) a defendto a negotiated sentence imposed as part of a plea bargain is properly viewed as a challenge to the validity of the plea itself and thus requires a certificate of probable cause. [citation.people v. shelton specific sentence as part of his plea agreement the sentence is an issue that arose before entry of the guilty plea, and in order to challenge that sentence on appeal, people v. vargas (2007) 148 cal.app.4th 644, 652.) because appellant seeks to challenge a portion of his negotiated sentence which was imposed through his plea bargain, he was required to obtain a certificate of probable cause. (see people v. panizzon (1996) 13 cal.4th 68, 78 [where trial defendant required a certificate of probable cause to attack his sentence on appeal].) we therefore dismiss his appeal. ( 1237.5; people v. mendez (1999) 19 to the merits of the appeal, but mhas not obtained a certificate of probable cause].) 6 we have examined the entire record and are satisfied that no arguable issues exist, and that, wende procedure and our review of the record, appellant has received adequate and effective appellate review of the judgment entered against him in this case. (smith v. robbins (2000) 528 u.s. 259, 278; people v. kelly (2006) 40 cal.4th 106, 112113.) disposition the appeal is dismissed. not to be published in the official reports willhite, j. we concur: epstein, p. j. manella, j.
