(c)); 2 and (3) remand for transfer to a new judicial officer who shall, without consideration of the prior proceedings in this matter, exercise his or her independent judgment as to whether defendant qualifies for the sentencing option provided in section 1210.1. factual and procedural background defendant is charged with felony possession of methamphetamine (health & saf. code,  11377, subd. (a)) and possession of a smoking device (health & saf. code,  11364.1, subd. (a)(1).) on april 29, 2013, defendant entered a guilty plea to the charges and admitted the prior conviction.3 1 statutory references are to the penal code except where otherwise stated. sections 1210 and 1210.1 (sometimes referenced as proposition 36) were adopted by initiative on november 7, 2000 and became effective july 1, 2001. 2 in pertinent part subdivision (c) of code of civil procedure section 170.1 interests of justice it should direct that further proceedings be heard before a trial judge 3 in 2006, defendant was conviction of burglary ( 459), served a prison term for that conviction and committed a felony during the five years subsequent to the conclusion of the prison term ( 667.5). 3 defendant previously has received the treatment made available by ) of section possession offenses, has participated in two separate courses of drug treatment pursuant to subdivision (a), and is found by the court, by clear and convincing evidence, to be unamenable to any and all forms of available drug treatment, as defined in subdivision 4 on may 8, 2013, defendant appeared for sentencing. the trial court expressed hat defendant is not a suitable candidate record with multiple drug offenses and four prior probation grants under section 1210.1. two of the grants were successfully completed and one was not completed. however, at a subsequent hearing on may 13, 2013, a different judicial officer the court and counsel then discussed the may 8, 2013 hearing at which the presiding judge expressed a view that defendant is not unamenable for sentencing pursuant to section 1210.1. the court described the guilty plea entered on april 29, 4 or personal use, or 4 the court set another hearing, informing defendant he will have his choice of staying with the plea or withdrawing it and going to trial. on june 20, 2013, defendant again appeared for sentencing, at which time the trial judge described discussions he had conducted with other judges (none of which are relevant here) and indicated, rather than exercising his own discretion in sentencing the matter was continued to permit the filing of this petition. on august 7, 2013, we issued a notice that we were considering issuance of a peremptory writ of mandate (lewis v. superior court (1999) 19 cal.4th 1232; palma v. u.s. industrial fasteners, inc. (1984) 36 cal.3d 171; brown, winfield & canzoneri, inc. v. superior court (2010) 47 cal.4th 1233), based on the established procedural rule that an order made in one department during the progress of a cause cannot be changed by epartment of the superior court cannot enjoin, restrain, or (silverman v. superior court (1988) 203 cal.app.3d 145, 151.) thus, a judgment rendered in one department of the superior court is binding on that matter upon all other departments. (ibid such were not the law, conflicting adjudications of the same subject-matter by different departments of the one court would bring about an anomalous situation and people v. madrigal (1995) 37 cal.app.4th 791, 795-796.) the proceedings conducted after the case was assigned for sentencing brought about exactly that anomalous situation. discussion subdivision (c) of probation has completed the prescribed course of drug treatment as recommended by the treatment provider and ordered by the court and, as a result, there is reasonable cause to 5 and each time has returned to the use of drugs. however, case law refers to three chances only after violating a drug-people v. guzman (2003) 109 cal.app.4th 341, 348.) the statement in guzman is not universally accepted as specifying an absolute right to three chances at rehabilitation pursuant to section 1210.1. section 1210.1 e a trial court may (people v. hazle (2007) 157 cal.app.4th 567, 570.) the hazle court commented that e is structured to give the ordinary drug probationer three strikes, albeit with the possibility that the trial court will id. at p. 576.) hazle described section 1210.1 as giving a defendant three chances at rehabilitation, with increasing penalties for conviction, so as to provide a strong incentive to stop the drug usage. (ibid.) defendant has about nine drug related offenses, two prior convictions for nonviolent drug possession offenses and has participated in two separate courses of drug treatment. on its face, the statute applies to a defendant who has two prior convictions for nonviolent drug possession offenses and has participated in two separate courses of drug treatment found by the court, by clear and convincing evidence, to be unamenable to any and all forms of available drug treatmentitalics added.) the trial court clearly has discretion to determine whether there is clear and convincing evidence, as to whether a defendant, such as hall, is amenable to a third try at the rehabilitation treatment provided in section 1210.1. having reviewed the responses received from the parties following issuance of our interim order, it is clear that the entire matter relating to whether defendant is eligible for treatment as provided in section 1210.1 should be considered by a new judicial officer 6 without reference to any of the prior proceedings in the case. (code civ. proc.,  170.1, subd. (c).) disposition the petition for writ of mandate is granted in part. let a peremptory writ of mandate issue directing the trial court (1) to vacate all orders entered subsequent to the may 8, 2013 order; and (2) transfer the case to a new judicial officer with directions to exercise his or her own independent discretion as to whether defendant is eligible to once again be sentenced in accord with the provisions of section 1210.1. in all other respects the petition is denied. not to be published in the official reports croskey, acting p. j. we concur: kitching, j. aldrich, j.
