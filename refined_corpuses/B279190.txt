[] i advised you, as i was flipping through the information, that you had been misinformed . . . on two of your multiple counts. . . . just on two of them, when i looked at the information, you were looking at 30 years to life. i think the people told you it was 50 years to life. that is just on two of the counts. exposure for the other counts. based on that and your discussions with your attorney, you the people had indicated that they no longer wished to give you that offer because it was a jury trial and they were ready to proceed to trial. i implored on the people that they should still give you the offer because you had been told the wrong maximum exposure date. and in all fairness, because you had been advised of the wrong exposure date, the people should still give you the offer. and then the people agreed to give you the offer, however, on the condition that you would waive your back credits. and you said you understood that. you agreed to do so, and then we entered the plea. . . . appellant]: before you go on, i was i was being misled this whole time. . . . know what i was being sentenced for. counts. you told me that day of the trial my counts. stuff that i was supposed to be given. whether it was for trial. trial for. then youyou changed from 15 to life. i 7 was facing 15 to life until you told me. you changed it to 30 years to life the same day that you want me to pick a jury. i needi need counsel that is going to help me fight my case. nobody go out and get witnesses on my behalf or anything. all i been doing is coming back and forth to this place, and coming in here, getting extensions. i being pressured to take all of this time without having a fair trial or a chance to get evidence to beat this trial. i am noti am not guilty for this. the only reason that i i had to go to trial that day. if i went to trial that day without my evidence, i would lose. i know i would lose. trial court]: you did have to go to trial that day. that was the day that was set for trial. your attorney announced ready for trial. the people announced ready for trial. and you were sent here for trial, so appellant]: right. trial court]: appellant]: right. trial court]: i explained right here in this courtroom what you were looking at, the time that you were looking at. i told you appellant]: right. trial court]: [o]ver and over again you have a right to go to trial. appellant]: right. 8 trial court]: well, your attorney said otherwise. you your attorney was ready for trial. appellant]: my attorney trial court]: you may not have been ready for trial. appellant]: but trial court]: but your attorney . . . announced ready for trial. so he was ready to proceed to trial. appellant]: with no evidence. nono coming to ask me anything. no telling me anything about trial. even know we were going to trial. i got family members that is willing to come in as witness. at that point, the trial court stated. . . i was present. everything was perfectly explained to you. both side[s] were ready to go to trial. the people no longer even want to give you the offer, which i encouraged them to give it to you because your maximum exposure had been told differently to you. [] so sentenced appellant to a term of 16 years 8 months pursuant to the plea agreement. while the trial court was in the middle of explaining the consregister as a sex offender, appellant interrupted and said that he . . . a fair trial. i need a lawyer that will give me the correct information and not false 9 with. i am not a sex offender. i should not have to register for the trial court explained that appellant had given up his right to trial when he pleaded no contest. appellant said he pleaded only out of fear. he also said that at the time he entered his plea, he did not know what was going on. the trial court opined that sometimes taking a plea deal is the best advice when a defendant is facing 30 years to life on two out of 10 counts. appellant sincere, your honor. do this. and the morei was can you give me a chance to have a fair trial? asking. the you when you took the plea in my courtroom, sir. everything was explained to you. you were given as much time as needed. you were given the opportunity to go to trial that day. on that day, you entered the plea freely and voluntarily. [] now that you are nothing that i can do about that. [] good luck to you. this appeal followed. discussion i. relevant law. marsden permits a defendant to seek appointment of new counsel because his or her appointed counsel is providing inadequate representation. (people v. smith (2003) 30 cal.4th 581, 604 (smith); marsden, supra, 2 cal.3d at p. 124.) a trial court is required to conduct a marsden hearing at least some clear indication by [a] defendant, either personally or through his cwants a substitute 10 attorney. [citation.]people v. sanchez (2011) 53 cal.4th 80, 8990 (sanchez).) whenever a marsden forward-looking in the sense that counsel would be substituted in order to provide effective assistance in the futurepeople v. smith (1993) 6 cal.4th 684, 695.) ii. any error harmless. on october 12, 2016, appellant indicated, inter alia, that defense counsel did not inform him of the charges or potential sentence, and also that defense counsel did not gather evidence for trial, give him discovery or consult with him. appellant will give me the correct information and not false information right when we start the day of trial. he claimed his innocence and said that family members would testify on his behalf. in broad terms, appellant indicated that defense counsel was not providing effective assistance regarding trial or the plea deal. it is debatable whether appellant was asking for substitute counsel. assuming without deciding that appellant clearly asked for substitute counsel, any error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. (marsden, supra, 2 cal.3d at p. 124, citing chapman v. california marsden request came after appellant entered a plea. according to appellant, he was prejudiced because if substitute counsel had been appointed, basis for withdrawing his plea. as a result, he has not established prejudice. 11 disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. _____________________, acting p. j. ashmann-gerst we concur: _______________________, j. chavez _______________________, j. hoffstadt
