(a)(4))1 and further alleged that he inflicted great bodily injury ( 12022.7, subd. (a)). defendant went to trial, and a jury convicted defendant and found the great bodily injury allegation to be true. sente the trial court imposed a sentence of six years, comprised of a midterm sentence of three years on the assault charge plus an additional three years for the great bodily injury enhancement. defendant filed this timely appeal. 1 all further statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise indicated. 3 discussion i. ineffective assistance of counsel a. relevant facts doubt is proof that leaves you with an abiding conviction that the charge is true the attorneys gave their closing arguments. defense counsel reiterated that the jurors each defense counsel then referred to the answers given by one of the prospective jurors during jury selection; that prospective juror had indicated he did not want to serve on the jury because he felt that the verdict he reached on a trial six that the people have presented so much evidence that this charge is true that you have an abiding conviction . . . six years from now . . . [g]uilty beyond a reasonable doubt . . . means . . . you have an abiding conviction that the charge comfortable. when you go home finally [and] talk to your friends and family about the next year when you get your jury the prosecutor went on to repeat that the charge b. analysis defendant argues that his attorney was constitutionally ineffective because she did not object when the prosecutor allegedly equated proof beyond a reasonable doubt with the an attorney is constitutionally ineffective if (1) his performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness, and (2) but for that ineffectiveness, it is reasonably probable that the outcome of the proceeding would have been different.

(c)charged in this case, defendant was on probation for his 2013 felony conviction for petty theft with a prior ( 666). although this 2013 conviction is subject to redesignation as a misdemeanor under proposition 47 ( 1170.18), that offense had not been redesignated by the time of sentencing, and any subsequent redesignation of that conviction under proposition 47 would not apply retroactively. (people v. jones (2016) 1 cal.app.5th 221, 230, review granted sept. 14, 2016, s235901.)3 because defendant was not eligible report. defendant raises two arguments in response. first, he argues that we may not rely upon his ineligibility for probation because it was neither pled in the information nor proven to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt. we reject this argument. as noted above, dcommitted the current offense. defendant is correct that the people must plead and prove the first factthat is, any conviction that renders a defendant ineligible for probation. (people v. lo cicero (1969) 71 cal.2d 1186, 1194; people v. lara (2012) 54 cal.4th 896, 3 this issue is pending before our supreme court in people v. valenzuela (2016) 244 cal.app.4th 692, review granted march 30, 2016, s232900. 7 904.)4 however, the people complied with this requirement because the relevant conviction in this case was the current assault crime and its enhancementboth of which were pled in the information and proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. the people need not plead and prove the second factthat is, a defethe time of the instance offense. (people v. towne constitutional right to a jury trial and proof beyond a reasonable doubt on aggravating circumstances does not extend to the circumstance that a defendant was on probation or parole at the time of the offensehave pled and proven the first fact rendering defendant ineligible for probation and were excused from pleading and proving the second, the people complied with their pleading and proof obligation with respect to the facts that rendered defendant ineligible for probation. although the people did not plead and prove the legal conclusion that these two facts rendered defendant ineligible for probation under section 1203, subdivision (k), this is of no consequence facts. (see lara second, defendant contends that california rules of court, rule 4.411(b) provides rule (cal. rules of court, rule 4.411(a).) ordering a report in the latter situation is mandatory; in the former situation, it is prcompliance with this advisory suggestion consequently does not invalidate the sentencing. 4 we note that some courts have started to question the continued validity of lo cicero on the ground that probation is now viewed more as a form of clemency than a form of the sort people v. woodward (2011) 196 cal.app.4th 1143, 1152.) 8 disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. _______________________, j. hoffstadt we concur: _______________________, p. j. boren _______________________, j. chavez
