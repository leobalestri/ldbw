(f)) is unconstitutionally vague; and (2) the trial court abused its discretion and violated due process by finding an unreasonable risk of danger. we reject these contentions and affirm the order. factual and procedural background on june 13, 1997, los angeles county deputy sheriffs arrested williams for possession of 0.141 grams of cocaine base after seeing him staggering and stumbling on a sidewalk. on october 10, 1997, a jury convicted williams of possession of a controlled substance (health & saf. code,  11350, subd. (a)). the jury found that williams had suffered two prior robbery ( 211) convictions, and the trial court sentenced him to an indeterminate life term under the three strikes law. williams was 43 years old at the time of his conviction. on february 8, 2013, williams filed a petition for recall of sentence and resentencing under section 1170.126. the district attorney acknowledged that williams was eligible for resentencing, but argued that he was not suitable for resentencing because his prior criminal history and record of discipline while incarcerated showed that resentencing williams 1 all undesignated section references are to the penal code. 3 would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. after a hearing, the trial court found that resentencing williams would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety and denied the petition. the court filed a 15-page memorandum of decision discussing the evidence and concluding: the court acknowledges that some evidence in the record ge is well into the range of reduced recidivism, and having the strong emotional support of a sibling would no doubt be helpful upon release. the conduct of the commitment offense similarly supports release. possession of .14 grams of cocaine is among the least serious conduct the court has seen with respect to third-strike resentencing. without doubt, the disparity between representative of the problem the three strikes reform act was intended to address. resentencing petitioner would currently pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. with that inquiry in mind, the court concludes that petitioner is unsuitable for release at this tidiscussed ante, petitioner was quick to offer excuses for each instance of criminal conduct. this trend continued during his incarceration, in the form of a lengthy disciplinary history. that disciplinary history not only includes violent conduct during the pendency of this petition, but was also accompanied in many criminal history. finally, the record does not indicate that petitioner has adequate re-entry plans or marketable skills to support himself upon his release. taken together, this evidence 4 suggests that petitioner continues to engage in antisocial conduct, and has taken inadequate measures to prevent re-offense on release. the record before the court, viewed as a discussion 1. proposition 36 enacted by the voters in november 2012, proposition 36 modified the three strikes law by generally reducing the punishment is for an offense that is neither serious nor violent. ( 667, subd. (e)(2)(c); people v. valencia (2017) 3 cal.5th 347, 350.) proposition 36 also authorizes inmates currently serving an indeterminate life term under the former three strikes law to petition the court for recall of sentence and resentencing in rules. ( 1170.126, subds. (a), (b); people v. perez (2018) 4 cal.5th 1055, 1062.) an inmate is eligible for resentencing under proposition 36 if the inmate is currently serving an indeterminate life term under the three strikes law for a conviction of a felony that is not classified as serious or violent after proposition 36, the current conviction is not for a disqualifying offense, and the inmate has no prior conviction for a disqualifying offense.2 2 disqualifying current offenses include offenses involving large quantities of controlled substances, certain sex offenses, and offenses in which the defendant used a firearm, was armed with a firearm or deadly weapon, or intended to cause great bodily injury. ( 667, subd. (e)(2)(c)(i)-(iii), 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(c)(i)-(iii); people v. johnson (2015) 61 cal.4th 674, 681.) 5 ( 1170.126, subd. (e); people v. johnson, supra, 61 cal.4th at pp. 681682.) if the trial court determines that the petitioner satisfies these criteria and is eligible for resentencing, the discretion, determines that resentencing the petitioner would ( 1170.126, subd. (f).) xercising its discretion in subdivision (f), the court may consider: the type of crimes committed, the extent of injury to victims, the length of prior prison commitments, and the remoteness of the crimes; rehabilitation while incarcerated; and determines to be relevant in deciding whether a new sentence would result in an unreasona( 1170.126, subd. (g).) 2. the statutory language is not unconstitutionally vague s. (f) & (g)) is homicide, solicitation to commit murder, assault with a machine gun on a peace officer or firefighter, possession of a weapon of mass destruction, and any serious or violent felony punishable by life imprisonment or death. ( 667, subd. (e)(2)(c)(iv), 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(c)(iv); johnson, at p. 682.) williams has not suffered a conviction of any of the disqualifying current or prior offenses. 6 unconstitutionally vague because and no discernible standard to determine when such a risk is unreasonable. the void-for-vagueness doctrine, part of the constitutional requirement of due process of law (u.s. const., 5th and 14th amends.), meanpeople v. hall (2017) 2 cal.5th 494, 500, quoting connally v. general construction co. (1926) 269 u.s. 385, 391.) hall, at p. 503.) there is a strong presumption that statutes are unconstitutionality clearly, positively, and unmistakably briggs v. brown (2017) 3 cal.5th 808, 828; accord, people v. morgan (2007) 42 cal.4th 593, 605606.) the constitutionality of a statute is a question of law that we review de novo. (vergara v. state of califorina (2016) 246 cal.app.4th 619, 642.) people v. garcia (2014) 230 cal.app.4th 763 held that the (1170.126, subd. (f)) is not unconstitutionally vague. the meaning of the quoted language can be ascertained by reference to the examples of evidence the court may consider in making its history and record of discipline and rehabilitation while incarcerated. (garcia, at pp. 769770.) people v. flores (2014) 7 227 cal.app.4th 1070 also rejected the contention that the quoted court judge is capable of exercising discretion, justly applying the public safety exception, and determining whether a lesser sentence would impose an unreasonable risk of harm to the id. at p. 1075; see people v. valencia, supra, 3 cal.5th at pp. 354unconstit kind are not impermissibly vague, provided meaning can be objectively ascertained by reference to common experiences of people v. morgan (2007) 42 cal.4th 593, 606 [67 cal.rptr.3d 653, 170 p.3d 129] quoting people v. daniels (1969) 71 cal.2d 1119, 1128(people v. garcia, supra, 230 cal.app.4th at p. 769; accord, people v. flores, supra, 227 cal.app.4th at p. 1075.) we agree with this reasoning and conclude that the 1170.126, subdivisions (f) and (g) is not unconstitutionally vague. johnson v. united states (2015) 135 s.ct. 2551, cited by williams, is unavailing. johnson held that the statutory criminal act of 1984, which included conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another,known as the residual clause, was unconstitutionally vague. (johnson, at p. 2555.) under supreme court precedent, a court determines whether a crime qualifies as a violent felony by 8 reference to how the law defines the offense and the kind of conduct the crime involves in the ordinary case. (id. at p. 25572559.) johnson held the residual clause was unconstitutionally assessment of risk to a judicially imag-world iduncertainty about how much risk it takes for a crime to qualify as id. at p. 2558). johnson to app-world facts; it is quite another to apply it to a judge-imagined ibid.) in contrast, section 1170.126 ties the judicial assessment of dangerousness to real-world facts concerning thof discipline and rehabilitation while incarcerated, and does not tie an imprecise standard to a judge-imagined abstraction. we therefore hold that johnson is inapplicable here. 3. the trial court properly exercised its discretion williams contends the trial court abused its discretion and violated due process by finding that his resentencing would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. he argues that proposition 36 created a presumption that a petitioner who is eligible for resentencing should be resentenced. he also argues that he has a due process liberty interest in resentencing, which requires a rational nexus between his conclusion of dangerousness. section 1170.126, subdivisions (f) expressly vests the trial court with discretion to determine whether resentencing the petitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. in exercising its discretion, the court may consider (1) the 9 of discipline and rehabilitation while incarcerated, and (3) any other evidence relevant to the determination. (id., subd. (g).) ntencing would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety for abuse of discretion. (people v. buford (2016) 4 cal.app.5th 886, 895, review granted jan. 11, 2017, s238790, review dismissed nov. 15, 2017.)3 is statutorily vested in the trial court, its exercise of that discretion court exercised its discretion in an arbitrary, capricious or patently absurd manner that resulted in a manifest miscarriage people v. rodrigues (1994) 8 cal.4th 1060, 11241125.) we review any factual findings in connection with that determination under the substantial evidence test. (buford, at p. 901.) courts of appeal have rejected the argument that section 1170.126, subdivision (f) creates a presumption in favor of resentencing. instead, the provision grants discretion to the trial court to determine whether resentencing would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety, with no presumption in favor of resentencing. (people v. buford, supra, 4 cal.app.5th at pp. 901903; people v. esparza (2015) 242 cal.app.4th 726, 738739.) we agree. we need not decide whether williams has a due process liberty interest in resentencing because we conclude that our review of the dangerousness determination for abuse of 3 the california supreme court granted and then dismissed review in people v. buford (s238790) without ordering the court of appeal opinion depublished, so the opinion remains published. (cal. rules of court, rule 8.528(b)(3).) 10 because we conclude that the trial court properly exercised its discretion, as discussed post, there was no due process violation. williams has an extensive history of criminal convictions. in february 1981, williams was convicted of exhibiting a deadly weapon ( 417), a misdemeanor. he was sentenced to one year of probation and 10 days in jail. in january 1982, williams was convicted of misdemeanor grand theft ( 487) and sentenced to two years of probation and 60 days in jail. in april 1983, williams pled guilty to procuring sex by misrepresentation ( 266), a felony. the crime involved an undercover police officer. williams was sentenced to five years of probation and 180 days in jail. in september 1983, he was convicted of exhibiting a deadly weapon ( 417) and was sentenced to two days in jail. in march 1984, he was convicted of attempted burglary ( 459) and sentenced to two years of probation and 60 days in jail. in may 1986, williams was convicted of possession of a deadly weapon ( 12020, subd. (a)) and sentenced to 18 months of probation and 5 days in jail. in october 1986, williams pled guilty to robbery ( 211), his first strike, and was sentenced to three years of probation and 270 days in jail. in may 1987, williams was convicted of robbery, his second strike, and was sentenced to eight years in prison. in october 1995, he was convicted of forgery and sentenced to 32 months in prison. in november 1996, williams was convicted of possessing drug paraphernalia (health & saf. code,  11364) and sentenced to 24 months of probation and 15 days in jail. in june 1997, williams was convicted of possession of a controlled substance (health & saf. code,  11350, subd. (a)), his third 11 strike, and sentenced to an indefinite term of 25 years to life in prison. williams also has an extensive record of disciplinary violations while incarcerated. the most serious involved possession of an inmate-manufactured weapon (a sharpened plastic shaft measuring five-inches in length) in october 2004, possession of controlled medication for distribution in may 2007, and possession of an inmate-manufactured weapon in april 2011 (d-cell batteries inside two tied socks).4 other violations involved mutual combat with his cellmate inside their cell in august 2003 and again in march 2008; mutual combat with another inmate in the prison yard in march 2008; willfully delaying a peace officer in the performance of his duties in november 2010, involving verbally belligerent conduct toward a prison guard; fighting his cellmate in their cell in february 2011; fighting another cellmate in the dayroom on two occasions in march 2011; willfully delaying a peace officer by refusing assigned housing in may 2011; battery on an inmate in january 2014; fighting another inmate in november 2016; disobeying a direct order on numerous occasions; and various low-level offenses. includes earning his general educational development (ged) certificate in august 1999; participating in alcoholics anonymous/narcotics anonymous meetings in 2001 and 2002; attending a series of eight lifer group therapy sessions in 2004; completing a life skills course in july 2008; passing ged examinations in social studies and mathematics in june 2009 4 findings on a charge that an inmate violated prison rules are documented in a rules violation report (rvr). 12 and september 2010; completing an impact of crime on victims training course (date unspecified); participating in veterans self-help programs in 2015 and 2016; participating in the lifers for change program in 2015 and 2016, and serving as sergeant at arms; and completing a 30-day self-improvement course called getting out by getting in in 2016. williams also received certificates of appreciation and other recognition for participating in a fundraiser at the prison in 2015 and christian studies in 2016, and for donating two books to the library in 2016. in october 2016, williams committed to a 90-to remain free from violence. in its memorandum of decision, the trial court carefully summarized and then analyzed the evidence. the court stated inal history, in part: [p]total convictions and several violations of probation and parole. this history begins in 1981, and continues consistently until the commitment offense. the evidence shows that petitioner was quick to offer excuses for his conduct, and often supplied false names and dates of birth when arrested. accordingly, the trial court stated regars record of discipline while incarcerated, in part: violence, typically in the form of fighting with other inmates. [citarecent rvrs, incurred while petitioner was seeking resentencing, involved fights instigated by petitioner. [citation.] in general, 13 on] staff and other inmates, at least twice requiring officers to deploy chemical weapons before petitioner yielded. [citation.] that this trend has continued as recently as november 2016 does not give the court confidence that petitioner would remain conflict-free if released. conflicts were the result of petitioner continuously being assigned homosexual cellmates. [citation.] this explanation was apparently never raised during any of petitionerand in fact, petitioner made contrary claims in several cases. in explanations for many of his rvrs echo the excuses offered for his criminal history. when accused of fighting, petitioner consistently claimed he was a victim of either circumstance or the aggression of others. in many cases, petitioner claimed that correctional officers wronged him or lacked authority to give him orders. in two instances, petitioner offered contradictory explanations at various points. . . . these excuses are further s record of rehabilitation while incarcerated: allay the concerns created by his disciplinary history. the court acknowledges that, since 2015, petitioner has begun to engage in relevant rehabilitative programming. however, the fact that demonstrates that much progress remains to be made. in 14 november 26, 2016, two days before his 90-day peace pledge was set to end. [citation.] if petitioner cannot remain violence-free while seeking resentencing and engaging in a voluntary peace pledge, it is difficult to conclude that petitioner will remain violence- regarding post-release plans, the trial court noted that s sister had written in support of resentencing, but she did not state whether williams could live with her. williams that he had applied to transitional programs, and he presented no other evidence of his post-release plans or of any marketable skills. s advanced age of 63 ordinarily would indicate that he no longer posed an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety, but his continuing disciplinary record, including recent violent incidents, s classification increased over the course of his inc5 determination that resentencing would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. williams argues that the court abused but williams has not shown that the court failed to consider any 5 a classification score measures the level of security risk nviction history, conduct in prison, and other factors. (in re morales (2013) 212 cal.app.4th 1410, 1413; see cal. code regs., tit. 15,  3375.) 15 relevant circumstances. his disagreement with the courtconclusion does not show an abuse of discretion. williams argues that the trial court erred by rejecting the argument that his erroneous designation which indicates a history of certain sex crimes, made him a target for violence by other inmates. the court noted that williams failed to raise this issue in his rvr hearings, and stated that the s pattern of attacking other inmates. we conclude that this ruling was reasonable; the court did not abuse its discretion. williams also argues that the trial court erred by failing to consider his rehabilitative record as a whole, minimizing his participation in self-help programs, and focusing on his latest fight that occurred after he filed his petition for resentencing. s participation in self-help programs and considered his rehabilitative record as a whole. balancing his rehabilitative record against his extensive criminal history, persistent prison misconduct, and lack of post-release re-entry plans and marketable skills, the court reasonably concluded that if relpeased, williams would present an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. williams argues that reasonable parole conditions and other measures could address any concerns regarding his post-release conduct, but he fails to show that the court could not reasonably conclude to the contrary, and therefore has shown no abuse of discretion. 16 disposition the order is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. micon, j.* we concur: manella, p. j. collins, j. *judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
