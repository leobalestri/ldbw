[j.c.], the alleged victim in aware that the record at trial. he also stated that her preliminary testimony had been impeached by fense counsel stated that preliminary hearing testimony. defense counsel argued that, pursuant to evidence code section 402, permitting detective carlin to be called thearing testimony without her being present violated his federal and state confrontation rights. rehabilitate her, or to question her on those issues that detective carlin will be using to impeach her on. and even though she testified at the preliminary hearing, and even though she was represented bymy client was represented by private counsel, and he did cross-examine her and cross[-]examine the detective at the time on the impeachment 5 issues, as the court knows, the preliminary hearing is pretty much limited in terms of what we can actually put on. affirmative defense my client had the full opportunity to cross-examine and examine the witness with respect defense counsel also objected to detective carlin reading the transcript of his preliminary hearing testimony at trial. the prosecutor argued that she would be introducing the entire preliminary hearing testimony of j.c. because she was an unavailable witness. she also would present the preliminary hearing transcript othe inconsistent statements are, so [she would] have [detective] carlin read his at the preliminary hearing, j.c. disclosed or [s she made to detective carlin, to which she again responded that she did not remember. the prosecutor then called detective carlin to the stand at the preliminary hearing to ask specific questions about what j.c. had told him. b. forfeiture the people argue that this issue has been forfeited on appeal because appellant did not be reviewed on appeal in the absence of a specific and timely objection in the trial people v. raley (1992) 6 2 cal.4th 870, 892; see also evid. code,  353; people v. rodrigues (1994) 8 cal.4th 1060, 1118.) here, the appellate record confirms that appellant did not object to the introduction he introduction of trial for the purposes of impeachment. because appellant failed to timely object below, he cannot raise this claim on appeal. (seijas, supra, 36 cal.4th at p. 303.) appellant does not dispute that he did not properly object; instead, in his reply by the [supreme] court in seijaswe disagree. given the nature of the argument raised on appeal, which presumably could have been the same argument raised below, an objection would have afforded the trial court the opportunity to hear the arguments of counsel on the issue and to exercise its discretion as to the admissibility of the evidence. additionally, appellant does not refer us to any place in the record to demonstrate how an objection would have been futile. in the absence of an objection, we conclude that appellant may not, for the first time on appeal, raise this argument. c. no sixth amendment violation regardless, no sixth amendment violation occurred. both the federal and against him. (u.s. const., 6th amend.; cal. const., art. i,  15.) that right includes the right to rehabilitate a witness. (see, e.g., people v. carter (1957) 48 cal.2d 737, 752753 [same due process interest in rehabilitation evidence as in impeachment evidence].) nfront his accuser, however, is not absolute. (seijas, supra, 36 cal.4th at p. 303.) proceeding in which the testimony was given and had the right and opportunity to cross-(evid. code,  1291, subd. (a)(2); see also seijas, supra, 36 cal.4th at p. 303 [admission 7 of prior testimony by an unavailable witness does not violate the sixth amendment if the defendant had both an opportunity to cross-examine the witness at the prior hearing and an interest and motive similar to that which he has at the [subsequent].) prior testimony does not violate the constitutional right of confrontation. (people v. herrera (2010) 49 cal.4th 613, 621.) in seijas, the supreme court held that the preliminary hearing testimony of an unavailable witness was admissible at trial so long as the defendant had a prior opportunity to cross-examine the witness. (seijas, supra, 36 cal.4th at p. 303; see also people v. herrera, supra, 49 cal.4th at p. 621.) in fact, the california supreme court -examine an unavailable witness at the preliminary hearing was inadequate to permit admission of the former testimony at trial. (people v. herrera, supra, at pp. 621622.) here, both requirementsunavailability and a prior opportunity to cross-examinewere met. at some point prior to trial, the parties became aware that j.c. was unavailable to testify at trial. defense counsel lodged no objection to the fact that j.c. was legally unavailable. further, appellant appears to concede that the first requirement has been satisfied as he does not argue otherwise in his opening brief. appellant also had an opportunity to cross-examine j.c. at the preliminary represented by private counsel, and he did cross-she may have been impeached by detective carlin, j.c. was excused from the preliminar; appellant could have recalled her at the preliminary hearing after detective carlin testified to rehabilitate herhe chose not to do so. (people v. smith (2003) 30 cal.4th 581, 611s defendant was given the opportunity for effective cross-examination, the statutory requirements [of evidence code section 1291] were satisfied; the admissibility of this evidence did not depend on whether defendant availed himself fully of that opportuni 8 urging reversal, appellant argues that preliminary hearings do not afford defendants the opportunity to have constitutionally adequate confrontation because preliminreversed because he did not have the opportunity to rehabilitate the impeached witness o, people v. valencia (2008) 43 cal.4th 268, 293proceeding is not dissimilar to his interest at a first proceeding within the meaning of evidence code section 1291, subdivision (a)(2), simply because events occurring after the first proceeding might have led counsel to alter the nature and scope of cross- it follows that we (auto equity sales, inc. v. superior court (1962) 57 cal.2d 450, 455.) disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. _____________________________, j. ashmann-gerst we concur: ______________________________, p. j. boren ______________________________, j. chavez
