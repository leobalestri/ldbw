(cal. const., art ii,  10, subd.

(people v. shabazz (2015) 237 cal.app.4th 303, 308; people v. diaz, supra, at pp. 1327-1328.) as pertinent here, proposition 47 added money, labor, real or personal property taken does not exceed nine hundred fifty dollars a misdemeanor. on november 24, 2014, pursuant to a negotiated disposition, orozco completed a plea form that listed his offense as section 2 at the plea proceeding, orozco the charge of violation of penal code section 666.5 underlying offense, violation of vehicle code section 10851, fell within the parameters of section 490.2. the prosecutor acknowledged that the people could not prove the value of the truck was over $950; defense counsel argued that pursuant to newly enacted section 490.2, the offense should therefore be designated a misdemeanor. the trial court opined be violated by unlawfully driving, as opposed to taking, a vehicle. defense counsel suggested that if the court intended to make a factual finding in order to rule on the application of proposition 47, it should take testimony on the question. the court agreed that the testimony of the victim, who was present in the courtroom, would be helpful in enabling it to determine whether there was a factual basis for the plea and whether the offense was a felony or a misdemeanor.3 2 we take judicial notice of plea form and materials in the trial court file. (evid. code,  452, subd. (d), 459, subd. (a).) 3 when taking a conditional plea of guilty or no contest to a felony, a trial court is required by section 1192.5 to determine that a factual basis for the plea exists. (people v. holmes (2004) 32 cal.4th 432, 435; people v. willard (2007) 154 cal.app.4th 1329, 4 the victim testified as follows. in october 2014 he parked his 1986 toyota truck, with the key inside, while he briefly shopped. when he returned five minutes later, the truck was gone. he had not given anyone permission to drive the vehicle. on october 29, 2014 he was at a gas station at the corner of roscoe and laurel canyon boulevards. he saw orozco slowly driving the truck in the gas station parking lot for approximately 35 feet. orozco then stopped the truck and he and his passenger exited. the trial court put over sentencing so it could further research the application of section 490.2. at a subsequent hearing, it implicitly ruled that because the evidence showed orozco only drove, rather than stole, the truck, section 490.2 did not apply. it sentenced orozco to the low term of two years pursuant to section 1170, subdivision (h)(5)(b), with 364 days of actual custody and 366 days of supervised release. it imposed a restitution fine, a stayed probation revocation restitution fine, a court operations assessment, a criminal conviction assessment, and a crime prevention fine and penalty assessment. pursuant to the plea negotiation, the court dismissed count 2. on december 17, 2014, the trial court issued a certificate of probable cause on the question of whether orozco was entitled to have the charge designated a misdemeanor pursuant to proposition 47. orozco filed his notice of appeal the same day. 1333-1334.) document such as a police report, a complaint, a written plea agreement, a probation (people v. holmes, supra, at pp. 436, 442; people v. french (2008) 43 cal.4th 36, 50-51.) here, defense counsel declined to stipulate to a factual basis. orozco does not challenge d we express no 5 discussion 1. validity of the plea section 666.5 imposes a greater base term for repeated violations of vehicle code section 10851.4 (people v. demara (1995) 41 cal.app.4th 448, 452; people v. garcia (2003) 107 cal.app.4th 1159, 1165-1166; people v. carter (1996) 48 cal.app.4th 1536, 1538.) it does not define a substantive offense. (people v. young (1991) 234 cal.app.3d 111, 113-115.) we asked the parties to provide supplemental briefing on the question of the people acknowledge that they erred by charging orozco with violation of section 666.5 rather than vehicle code section 10851, and the trial court erred when it asked orozco for a plea to section 666.5. however, they aver that because the information provided adequate notice of the underlying crime, and there is no question orozco knew he was actually pleading to violation of vehicle code section 10851, the plea is valid nonetheless. orozco avers that he is out of custody, is not challenging the validity of his plea, and has no interest in vacating his plea agreement. he s. we conclude the plea was valid. due process requires that a criminal defendant receive notice of the charges against him. (people v. coryell (2003) 110 cal.app.4th 1299, 1308; people v. tardy (2003) 112 cal.app.4th 783, 786; people v. haskin (1992) 4 cal.app.4th 1434, 1438.) due process is satisfied when there is no question which of 4 every person who, having been previously convicted of a felony violation of section 10851 of the vehicle code, or felony grand theft involving an automobile in violation of subdivision (d) of section 487 or former subdivision (3) of section 487, as that section read prior to being amended by section 4 of chapter 1125 of the statutes of 1993, or felony grand theft involving a motor vehicle, as defined in section 415 of the vehicle code, any trailer, as defined in section 630 of the vehicle code, any special construction equipment, as defined in section 565 of the vehicle code, or any vessel, as defined in section 21 of the harbors and navigation code in violation of former section 487h, or a felony violation of section 496d regardless of whether or not the person actually served a prior prison term for those offenses, is subsequently convicted of any of these offenses shall be punished by imprisonment pursuant to subdivision (h) of section 1170 for two, three, or four years, or 6 s was the basis for the charge. (people v. coryell, supra, at p. 1308.) an accusatory pleading need not specify by number the code section under which a defendant is charged. (people v. thomas (1987) 43 cal.3d 818, 826; people v. gerber (2011) 196 cal.app.4th 368, 388.) under section 952, a charging document is sufficient 5 even a reference to an incorrect code section may be immaterial; l statute can be overcome by factual people v. haskin, supra, at p. 1439; see people v. thomas, supra, at p. 826; people v. schueren (1973) 10 cal.3d 553, 558; people v. gerber, supra, at p. 388.) furthermore, section 960 provides that o accusatory pleading is insufficient, nor can the trial, judgment, or other proceeding thereon be affected by reason of any defect or imperfection in matter of form which does not prejudice a substantial right of the defendant upon the merits.( 960; people v. thomas, supra, at p. 826.) the information here provided orozco with adequate notice that he was charged with violating vehicle code section 10851, with prior felony convictions for the same offense. it icle, to wit, 1986 toyota truck, then and there the personal property of juan lanada verde, without the consent of and with intent, either permanently or temporarily, to deprive the said this language plainly informed orozco 5 section 952 providesbe sufficient if it contains in substance, a statement that the accused has committed some public offense therein specified. such statement may be made in ordinary and concise language without any technical averments or any allegations of matter not essential to be proved. it may be in the words of the enactment describing the offense or declaring the matter to be a public offense, or in any words sufficient to give the accused notice of the offense of which he is accused. in charging theft it shall be sufficient to allege that the 7 that he was being charged with violating vehicle code section 10851, unlawfully driving or taking a vehicle. the omission of a reference to vehicle code section 10851 was immaterial. we further conclude that on the facts of this case, the plea encompassed vehicle code section 10851. people v. wallace (2003) 109 cal.app.4th 1699 is instructive. there the defendant purported to plead nolo contendere to violation of section 422.7, a hate crime statute that elevated misdemeanors to felonies when a crime caused physical injury and was committed for the purpose of intimidating or civil rights. (people v. wallace, supra, at p. 1701.) wallace concluded that because section 422.7 was a penalty provision, not a people v. wallace, supra, at pp. 1701-1703, 1704.) the court reversed the that does not exist, notwithstanding the defendant id. at p. 1704.) significant to our analysis here, it distinguished section 422.7 from section 666, petty theft with a prior. wallace explained: aside from the fact that the california supreme court has described s- (people v. bouzas (1991) 53 cal.3d 467, 479), that section identifies the substantive offense--i.e., petty theft--that shall be treated as a felony under the circumstances provided in the statute. section 422.7, by contrast, does not specify any substantive offense, but rather merely provides for increased punishment of a wide range wallace, supra, at p. 1703.) in people v. vasilyan (2009) 174 cal.app.4th 443, a divided appellate panel followed wallace was void. (people v. vasilyan, supra, at p. 446.) the majority there must be a substantive crime and a punishment for that crime in order to constitute a criminal offense, (id. at pp. 449-450, 453.) because the act with which vasilyan was charged was not a crime, it did not matter whether he had, in fact, committed assault and 8 battery (id. at pp. 450, 452.) wallace and vasilyan are distinguishable from the instant matter because section 422.7, the statute at issue in those cases, is distinguishable from section 666.5. like section 666,6 section 666.5 requires commission of a current substantive offense. (see people v. young, supra, 234 cal.app.3d at p. 114 [the language of  666.5, subd. (a), 666].) section 666 provides that a person who has been convicted of various theft-( 666, subd. (a).) similarly, section 666.5 provides that a person who has been previously convicted of a felony violation of various theft-any of these offenses shall ( 666.5, subd. (a), italics added.) thus, although section 666.5 is a penalty provision, it is expressly attached to enumerated substantive offenses and does not apply absent a current conviction of one of those offenses.7 a no contest plea admits every element of the offense charged, as well as all allegations and factors comprising the charge contained in the pleading. (people v. palacios (1997) 6 section 666, like section 666.5, does not define a substantive offense, but is a sentencing provision. (people v. bouzas, supra, 53 cal.3d at pp. 478-479; people v. rader (2014) 228 cal.app.4th 184, 191; people v. robinson (2004) 122 cal.app.4th 275, 281.) formerly, section 666 required only a single prior theft-related conviction for the current petty theft offense to qualify as a felony. (people v. diaz, supra, 238 people v. diaz, supra, at p. 1330.) as amended, section 666 applies only when the defendant served a term of imprisonment for the prior theft-related conviction, and is either required to register as a sex offender or has a prior conviction for one of several enumerated offenses. (people v. diaz, supra, at p. 1330.) 7 sections 666 and 666.5 differ in that under section 666, the current substantive crime is always petty theft, whereas under section 666.5, the current substantive crime may be one of several listed offenses. therefore, when section 666.5 is at issue, the charging document and the plea should specify the substantive offense being charged or pleaded to. we express no opinion on the proper procedure when section 666 is at issue. 9 56 cal.app.4th 252, 257-258; sanchez v. superior court (2002) 102 cal.app.4th 1266, 1269; people v. caceres (1997) 52 cal.app.4th 106, 109, fn. 4.) therefore, when orozco pleaded no contest to violating section 666.5, he necessarily pleaded to one of the substantive offenses listed in the statute; unlike in wallace and vasilyan, he did not plead to a non-crime. given the language of the information and the fact there was and is no dispute that the offense at issue was violation of vehicle code section 10851, the plea was valid. 2. applicability of section 490.2 to vehicle code section 10851 we turn, then, to the issue orozco initially raised: whether his crime of unlawfully driving the stolen truck must be categorized as a misdemeanor under proposition 47.8 we conclude that section 490.2 does not apply to violations of vehicle code section 10851, whether of the theft or the joyriding variety. a. proposition 47 and section 490.2 as noted, proposition 47 amended and enacted various provisions of the penal and health and safety codes to reduce certain drug and theft offenses to misdemeanors, unless committed by ineligible defendants. (alejandro n. v. superior court (2015) 238 cal.app.4th 1209, 1222; people v. diaz, supra, 238 cal.app.4th at pp. 1327-1328; people v. shabazz, supra, 237 cal.app.4th at p. 308.) when an eligible defendant is proposition 47 as a misdemeanor, he or she may only be convicted of a misdemeanor. (people v. shabazz, supra, at p. 309.) proposition 47 also enacted section 1170.18, which creates a procedure whereby a defendant who has suffered a felony conviction of one of the reclassified crimes can petition to have it redesignated a misdemeanor. (people v. sherow (2015) 239 cal.app.4th 875, 879.) one of the mechanisms by which proposition 47 reduced theft crimes to misdemeanors was enactment of section 490.2. it provides in pertinent part: 8 we assume for purposes of argument that there was a factual basis for the allegation orozco unlawfully drove the truck, but not for the allegation that he stole it. 10 obtaining any property by theft where the value of the money, labor, real or personal property taken does not exceed nine hundred fifty dollars ($950) shall be considered petty theft and shall be punished as a misdemeanor, except that such person may instead be punished pursuant to subdivision (h) of section 1170 if that person has one or more prior convictions for an offense specified in clause (iv) of subparagraph (c) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (e) of section 667 or for an offense requiring registration pursuant to ( 490.2, subd. (a).) b. theft and vehicle code section 10851 section 484 (which predates proposition 47 and was not amended by it) defines take, carry, lead, or drive away the personal property of another, or who shall fraudulently appropriate property which has been entrusted to him or her, or who shall knowingly and designedly, by any false or fraudulent representation or pretense, defraud any other person of money, labor or real or personal property, or who causes or procures others to report falsely of his or her wealth or mercantile character and by thus imposing upon any person, obtains credit and thereby fraudulently gets or obtains possession of money, or property or obtains the labor or service of another, is guilty of theft. ( 484, subd. (a), italics added.) an element of the crime of theft is the intent to permanently deprive the owner of the property. (people v. bacon (2010) 50 cal.4th 1082, 1117; in re jesus o. (2007) 40 cal.4th 859, 867; people v. avery (2002) 27 cal.4th 49, 52.)9 vehicle code section or takes a vehicle not his or her own, without the consent of the owner thereof, and with intent either to permanently or temporarily deprive the owner thereof of his or her title to or possession of the vehicle, whether with or without intent to steal the vehicle, or any person who is a party or an accessory to or an accomplice in the driving or unauthorized 9 the intent to deprive an owner of the main value of his or her property is the equivalent of the intent to permanently deprive. (people v. avery, supra, 27 cal.4th at p. 57.) 11 taking or stealing, is guilty of a public offense and, upon conviction thereof, shall be punished by imprisonment in a county jail for not more than one year or pursuant to subdivision (h) of section 1170 of the penal code or by a fine of not more than five the statute address, inter alia, the theft or unauthorized driving of specific types of vehicles and punishment for recidivists. (veh. code,  10851, subds. (b), (e).) people v. garza (2005) 35 cal.4th 866, 876 (garzapeople v. smith (2013) a vehicle with the intent to steal it or by driving it with the intent only to temporarily garza, supra, at p. 876.) in garza, our supreme court erent context, that taking a vehicle with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of possession is a form of theft, and the taking may be accomplished by driving the vehicle away. for this reason, a defendant convicted under section 10851(a) of unlawfully taking a vehicle with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of possession has suffered a theft conviction and may not also be convicted under section 496(a) of receiving the same vehicle as stolen property. on the other hand, unlawful driving of a vehicle is not a form of theft when the driving occurs or continues after the theft is complete (for convenience, we will refer to this as posttheft driving). therefore, a conviction under section 10851(a) for posttheft driving is not a theft conviction and does not preclude a conviction under id. at p. 871.) c. section 490.2 does not apply to vehicle code section 10851 the question before us is whether section 490.2 ever applies to vehicle code our supreme court is currently considering whether proposition 47 applies to vehicle code section 10851. (people v. page (2015) 241 cal.app.4th 714, review granted jan. 27, 2016, s230793.) we recently held in 12 people v. solis (2016) 245 cal.app.4th 1099, that vehicle code section 10851 was not a ntencing provision, regardless of whether the conviction was for theft or joyriding. (people v. solis, supra, at pp. 1103, 1104.) the same conclusion applies here. when interpreting a voter initiative, our primary purpose is to ascertain and effectuate people v. park (2013) 56 cal.4th 782, 796; people v. briceno (2004) 34 cal.4th 451, 459; people v. shabazz, supra, 237 cal.app.4th at p. 313.) we apply the same principles that govern statutory construction. thus, we look first to the language of the statute, giving the words their ordinary meaning. (people v. park, at p. 796; people v. superior court (pearson) (2010) 48 cal.4th 564, 571.) the plain meaning of the statutory language controls, unless it would lead to absurd results the electorate could not have intended. (people v. birkett (1999) 21 cal.4th 226, 231; people v. brown (2014) 230 cal.app.4th 1502, 1508-1509.) the statutory language must be construed in the context of the statute as a whole and the overall statutory scheme. (people v. briceno, at p. 459; robert l. v. superior court (2003) 30 cal.4th 894, 901.) particularly the analyses and arguments contained in the official ballot pamphlet. (people v. superior court (pearson), supra, at p. 571; people v. shabazz, supra, at p. 313.) we review questions of statutory interpretation de novo. (people v. prunty (2015) 62 cal.4th 59, 71; people v. sherow, supra, 239 cal.app.4th at p. 878.) at first glance, it appears section 490.2, subdivision (a) obtaining applies when a defendant takes a vehicle worth $950 or less with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of possession. a vehicle is clearly personal property. under section 484, taking the personal property of another with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of it is theft. (see people v. chun (2009) 45 cal.4th 1172, 1183-1184; in re jesus o., supra, 40 cal.4th at p. 867.) indeed, our supreme court has stated that a defendant convicted under vehicle code section 10851 of unlawfully taking a vehicle with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of 13 possession people v. garza, supra, 35 cal.4th at p. 871.) but several factors militate against the conclusion section 490.2 apples to vehicle code section 10851. proposition 47 did not directly amend vehicle code section 10851, but left its provisions intact. nor does section 490.2 mention vehicle code section 10851; in pertinent part, it expressly references only the grand theft statute, section 487. this omission is significant because, unlike statutes that simply prohibit theft, vehicle code section 10851 is much broader, applying to defendants who have committed not theft but joyriding ). thus, section 490.2 cannot apply to all violations of vehicle code section 10851. provision, section 1170.18, likewise fails to include vehicle code section 10851 as one of the enumerated offenses eligible for resentencing. given the foregoing, application of proposition 47 to vehicle code section 10851 is unclear at best. moreover, it is settled that a specific statute prevails over a general statute on the same subject. (people v. ahmed (2011) 53 cal.4th 156, 163; people v. betts (2005) 34 cal.4th 1039, 1058 [if general and specific statutes dealing with the same subject are inconsistent, the specific prevails over the general]; velasquez v. superior court (2014) 227 cal.app.4th 1471, 1475; code civ. proc.,  1859.) here, vehicle code section 10851 is the more specific statute. subdivision (a) provides that violation of the statute is tively as a felony or a misdemeanor.10 (see people v. park, supra, 56 cal.4th at p. 789 & fn. 4; people v. solis, 10 imprisonment in the state prison, or notwithstanding any other provision of law, by imprisonment in a county jail under the provisions of subdivision (h) of section 1170. every other crime or public offense is a misdemeanor except those offenses that are people v. park, supra, 56 cal.4th at p. 789.) cial class of crimes involving conduct that varies widely in its chargeable or, in the discretion of the court, punishable as either a felony or a misdemeanor; that is, they are punishable either by a term in state prison or by people v. park, supra, at p. 789; 14 supra, 245 cal.app.4th at p. 1117.) vehicle code section 10851, subdivision (b) makes the offense a felony and prescribes specific terms when a defendant takes or unlawfully drives specialized vehicles under certain circumstances, i.e., ambulances, distinctively marked law enforcement or fire department vehicles on emergency calls, and vehicles that have been modified for the use of a disabled veteran or any other disabled person and display a distinguishing placard or plate. subdivision (e) provides that recidivists are punishable as set forth in section 666.5. section 666.5 specifies that a person who, having been previously convicted of a felony violation of vehicle code section 10851 or any of these offensesas a felon. ( 666.5, subd. (a), italics added.) the plain language of section 666.5 thus requires that both the prior and the current crime must be felonies in order for section 666.5 to apply. section 490.2 conflicts with these provisions. applying section 490.2 to vehicle code section 10851 would upset this careful scheme. if section 490.2 applied, theft of a vehicle $950. a defendant who stole one of the vehicles enumerated in subdivision (b) of vehicle code section 10851, if valued at $950 or less, could be sentenced only as a misdemeanant, rather than to the two, three, or four year term specified.11 and, a recidivist who stole a vehicle worth less than $950 could not be punished for his or her recidivism, since under section 666.5 both the current and prior crimes must be felonies. certainly, the electorate could have amended vehicle code section 10851 in this fashion had it chosen to do so. but the statutory language suggests otherwise. when the legislature or here, the voters it people v. rivera, supra, 233 cal.app.4th at p. 1094;  17, subd. (b).) 11 we acknowledge it is unlikely, as a practical matter, that a police car, fire vehicle, or ambulance being used on an emergency call would ever fall beneath the $950 threshold. the same is not necessarily true in regard to a vehicle modified for a disabled person. 15 in re greg f. (2012) 55 cal.4th 393, 406-407age in regard to section 487 and statutes defining grand theft, but not to vehicle code section 10851. section 490.2 defining grand theft, obtaining any property by theft where the value of the money, labor, real or personal property taken does not exceed nine hundred fifty dollars ($950) shall be defines the offense of unlawfully driving or taking a vehicle. had the electorate intended section 490.2 to apply to vehicle code section 10851, it could easily have drafted section , section 487, or any provision approved by the voters did not include this or similar may not properly interpret the measure in a way that the electorate did not contemplate: the voters should get what they enpeople v. park, supra, 56 cal.4th at p. 796.) furthermore, the language of a statute should not be given a literal meaning if doing so would result in absurd consequences that the legislature, or in this case the electorate, could not have intended. (people v. leiva (2013) 56 cal.4th 498, 506; people v. rodriguez (2012) 55 cal.4th 1125, 1131; in re j. w. (2002) 29 cal.4th 200, 209-210; people v. toussain (2015) 240 cal.app.4th 974, 979; in re greg f., supra, 55 .) construing section 490.2 to apply to vehicle code section 10851 would lead to just such an absurd consequence. as noted, vehicle code section 10851 can be violated in two ways: taking a vehicle with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of possession; or driving the vehicle with the intent to temporarily deprive the owner of possession. (garza, supra, 35 cal.4th at p. 876 [a defendant can violate veh. code,  10851, subd. taking a vehicle with the intent to steal it or by driving it with the intent only to the former, but not the 16 latter, amounts to theft. as garza explained, posttheft driving or joyriding not a form of theft.garza, supra, at p. 871, italics added.) thus, section 490.2 cannot apply to the icle code section 10851; a joyrider who is not the actual thief did not obtain the property by theft. therefore, if section 490.2 applies to vehicle code section 10851, the result is that where the vehicle is worth $950 or less, version remains a wobbler. so construed, the law would require that the defendant with the more culpable mental state (the intent to permanently deprive the owner of possession) be convicted of only a misdemeanor, while the defendant with the less culpable mental state (to temporarily deprive the owner of possession) could be convicted of a felony. in our view, this is an absurd result that the electorate did not intend. nothing in the ballot pamphlet suggests the voters were especially concerned about the activities of posttheft drivers, as opposed to auto thieves; nothing suggests they thought a thief who steals a low-value vehicle should be treated as a mere petty criminal, while a defendant who did not steal, but drives, the exact same vehicle should be treated as a felon. for the foregoing reasons, we conclude section 490.2 does not apply to vehicle uest to designate his offense a misdemeanor. disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports aldrich, j. i concur: edmon, p. j. 1 lavin, j., concurring: i agree with the majority that a conviction under vehicle code section 10851 is not a -theft driving convictions more harshly than nd the duty of the legislature [or voters] to define degrees of culpability and punishment, and to distinguish people v. turnage such policy judgments entail.(ibid., quoting people v. ward (2005) 36 cal.4th 186, 217.) second, by punishing taking or driving a vehicle without the intent to deprive the owner of permanent title or possession, vehicle code section 10851 addresses dangers to the public. for example, vehicle code section 10850 provides that the provisions of chapter 4, which includes whatever nature, publicly maintained and open to the use of the public for purposes of focus on particular victimsthe owners of stolen personal property. lavin, j.
