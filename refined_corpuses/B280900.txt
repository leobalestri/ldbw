(in re johnny m. (2002) 100 cal.app.4th 1128, 1132.) 4 espiquita argues the trial court abused its discretion in awarding $70,612.52 in lost wages because (1) the award was based on an unsupported conclusion that she earned an average of $91.55 per day, and (2) there was no evidence the victim would be unable to work for two years. we disagree. in support of the first contention, espiquita argues that the evidence aily income was only $88.18. espiquita bases this contention on evidence that, in the 145 days before the crime (approximately five months), the victim earned $12,787.22, which divided by 145 days equals $88.18 per earnings over the year prior to the attack. the evidence showed that the victim had earned $33,415.55 during that time which divided by 365 days equals $91.55 per day. simply chose different periods of time by which to estimate the . the law does not require the trial court prior to the attack; rather, it was reasonable for the trial court to take an average based on a year prior. wages for a period of two years. espiquita does not dispute that the victim was unable to work for approximately 14 months after the attack due to her injuries, but argues that there was no evidence the victim could not work after that time. in the trial court, espiquita victim could not work for two years after the attack, and has therefore forfeited the argument. (people v. brasure (2008) 42 cal.4th 1037, 1075.) 5 even if we were to decide the argument on its merits, we would find no abuse of discretion. espiquita argues that the victim was able to return to work on july 6, 2016, when her teeth were repaired. injuries beyond dental damage that prevented her from working. the victim worked as a lifeguard prior to the attack, an occupation which requires both physical fitness and mental focus. the prosecution presented evidence that eight months after the attack the victim suffered from daily headaches, had difficulty seeing at times, and was disabled from post-traumatic stress disorder and depression. this was sufficient to establish a prima inhibit her from lifeguarding for approximately another year. the defense did not present any evidence to rebut that inference and, therefore, did not meet its burden of showing that the amount of lost wages was other than that claimed by the victim. disposition the restitution order is affirmed. rubin, j. we concur: bigelow, p. j. grimes, j.
