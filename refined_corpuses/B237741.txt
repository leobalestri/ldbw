(a))1 and torture ( 206). the information specially alleged persons had suffered a prior serious felony convictio 667, subds. (b)-(i), 1170.12, subds. (a)-(d)) and section 667, subdivision (a), and had served six separate prison terms for felony convictions ( 667.5, subd. (b)). persons pleaded not guilty and denied the special allegations. 2. the evidence at trial beatrice brothers lived in her own home with her adult son, sidney cole. bobby gates lived in a converted garage in the back of the house along with his girlfriend, robinson, lived in a house across the street with her daughter, mimi. in the early morning of december 5, 2005, after john had told his mother and confronted gates in her living room and accused him of molesting john and mimi. after being summoned by brothers, persons and his nephew, christopher yancy, arrived at the house; and brothers and hoskins told them gates had molested the children. persons tied gates to a chair and placed a rubber ball in his mouth to prevent him from speaking. when the ball fell out, brothers put it back in and secured it by tying a beating gates. 1 statutory references are to the penal code. 3 brothers hit him in the head with a broomstick 10 times with such force that the stick broke in half. persons hit gates in the face with his fist. robinson interrupted the attack, re in the house. brothers told yancy took gates back to the garage. robinson peered in the garage and saw persons and yancy taking turns brutally kicking gates whil-bull, jumping on gates and biting him. persons told police that, during the attack in the garage, brothers and hoskins sodomized gates with a heated rod. yancy poured rubbing alcohol on gathen lit a match and set him on fire. when gates started screaming, yancy gagged him with something. persons said he did not really participate in the beating in the garage. he group did not plan on killing gates; they just wanted to teach him a lesson for molesting children. gates died during the course of the attack. brothers and yancy dumped the body near the freeway and set it on fire. paul gliniecki, a deputy coroner testified gates had suffered blunt force trauma to his head, face, neck, torso, pelvis, arms and legs and had burns all over his body. a gag was found stuffed in his throat. according to dr. gliniecki, concenhaving been burned by a cigarette or the end of a heated metal rod while he was still inflicted while he was alive or postmortem, nor did he see any obvious evidence of forcible sodomy with a foreign object. gliniecki opined gates died primarily of asphyxiation and listed blunt force trauma as a contributing cause of death.2 2 brothers, yancy and persons were tried separately for their respective roles in people v. brothers (dec. 12, 2011, b225376) [nonpub. opn.] based on instructional error and 4 3. jury instructions, verdict and sentence the jury was instructed with calcrim nos. 520 (murder); 521 (degrees of murder); 540a and 540b (first degree felony murder based on torture or aiding and abetting torture); 400 and 401 (general principles of aiding and abetting); 402 (murder as a natural and probable consequence of torture); 810 (elements of torture); 570 (voluntary manslaughter based on killing in the heat of passion); and 522 (provocation reducing first degree murder to second degree murder or voluntary manslaughter). the jury found persons guilty of murder and torture and found the murder to be in the first degree. after persons waived his right to a jury trial on the prior conviction and prior prison term enhancement allegations, the court found each of those special allegations true. persons was sentenced, as a second-strike offender, to an aggregate state prison term of 61 years to life.3 discussion 1. in his closing argument defense counsel identified and explained various legal standards of proof to the juryprobable cause, preponderance of the evidence, clear and convincing evidence and beyond a reasonable doubtapparently to underscore the heightened burden imposed by the reasonable doubt standard. in the course of this explanation, defense counsel told the jury that something as important as parental rights conviction in people v. yancy (july 23, 2012, b228563) [nonpub opn.]. 3 entence consisted of 25 years to life for the murder, doubled to 50 years to life under the three strikes law, plus a consecutive five-year prior serious felony conviction enhancement and six consecutive one-year prior prison term enhancements. sentence on the torture conviction was stayed pursuant to section 654. 5 read a lot into what is meant by abiding conviction and so forth. [4] beyond-a-reasonable-doubt case. (see victor v. nebraska (1994) 511 u.s. 1, 22 [114 s.ct. 1239, 127 l.ed.2d 583] beyond a reasonable doubt, and the trial court must avoid defining reasonable doubt so as people v. aranda (2012) 55 cal.4th 342, 356; people v. mayo (2006) 140 cal.app.4th 535, 542.) court informed the jury that the only definition it was to rely on concerning reasonable doubt was the instruction the court had given to them. persons does not challenge the propriety of calcrim no. 220 nor would such a challenge have merit. (see people v. aranda, supra, obligation to instruct on principles of reasonable doubt by giving calcrim no. 220].) altered the definition of reasonable doubt in calcrim no. burden of proof. 2. the court properly instructed the jury on the intent required for torture for the purpose of revenge, extortion, persuasion, or for any sadistic purpose, inflicts great bodily injury as defined in section 1202.7 upon the person of another, is guilty of torture.

(2d college ed. 1992) p. 481 the latter definition must have been what the voters had in mind when they approved section 206 as part of proposition 115.6 because calcrim no. 810 permitted the jury his conviction should be reversed.7 5 in accordance with calcrim no. 810, the trial court instructed the jury that, to prove the defendant is guilty of torture, the p the defendant inflicted great bodily injury on someone else; [] and [] 2. when inflicting the injury, the defendant intended to cause cruel or extreme pain and suffering for the purpose of revenge, extortion, persuasion, or for any sadistic purpose. [] great bodily injury means significant or substantial physical injury. it is an injury that is greater than 6 section 206 was enacted araven v. deukmejian (1990) 52 cal.3d 336, 340; people v. barrera (1993) 14 cal.app.4th 1555, 1559.) the ballot initiative was a response to people v. singleton (1980) 112 cal.app.3d 418, to remedy what the authors of the initiative viewed as an unacceptably light penalty for a heinous offense not resulting in the death of the victim.

[ballot pamphlet argument in rape a young girl and hack off her arms, and serve only a minimal punishment, such as the 7-ection 206.1, enacted together with section 206 as part of proposition 115, made the new offense of torture punishable by imprisonment for life. 7 we review assertions of instructional error de novo to determine whether the instruction accurately states the law. (people v. cole (2004) 33 cal.4th 1158, 1210; 7 f a statute defining a crime or defense is generally an appropriate and desirable basis for an instruction, and is ordinarily sufficient when the defendant fails to request amplification. if the jury would have no difficulty in understanding the statute w(people v. poggi (1988) 45 cal.3d 306, 327; accord, people v. page (1980) 104 cal.app.3d 569, 577; see people v. mayfield (1997) 14 cal.4th 668, 778 [if instruction is adequate, trial court is under no obligation to amplify or explain in absence [citation], people v. roberge (2003) 29 cal.4th 979, 988.) people v. pearson . as used in [] commonsense meaning[] that the jury may be expected to use in applying the people v. williams (2006) 40 cal.4th 287, 338 [same].) in fact, numerous appellate courts have rejected the argument the language in section 206 is too vague or ambiguous to be properly understood. (see, e.g., people v. aguilar (1997) 58 [] 206, is not unconspeople v. misa (2006) 140 cal.app.4th 837, people v. vital (1996) 45 cal.app.4th 441, 444 [ 206 people v. alvarez (1996) 14 cal.4th 155, 217-218.) when the instruction is challenged as ambiguous and subject to an erroneous interpretation by the jury, we review the instruction independently to determine whether there is a reasonable likelihood the jury understood the instruction in the manner asserted by the defendant. (people v. cross (2008) 45 cal.4th 58, 67-68.) 8 people v. barrera (1993) 14 cal.app.4th 206, and therefore in caljic no. 9.90[8] are of such common usage that they are presumed to be within the understanding of reasonable here, is shifted from challenging the language of the statute to challenging the jury instruction incorporating that language. (see, e.g., aguilar, caljic no. barrera, at p. 1572 [holding neither  206 nor caljic no. 9.90 is vague or ambiguous; caljic extrpeople v. williams, supra, 40 cal.4th at p. 338), the trial court was under no obligation to sua sponte provide any amplifying or clarifying language to supplement calcrim no. 810. 3. was not reversible error a killing that would otherwise be murder is reduced to voluntary manslaughter if the defendant acted because of a sudden quarrel or in the heat of passion. (people v. lasko (2000) 23 cal.4th 101, 110; people v. moye (2009) 47 cal.4th 537, 549.) there are three elements to this provocation theory: (1) the defendant was provoked; (2) as a result of the provocation, the defendant acted rashly and under the influence of intense emotion that obscured his or her reasoning or judgment; and (3) the provocation would have caused a person of average disposition to act rashly and without due deliberation, that is, from passion rather than from judgment. (people v. breverman (1998) 19 cal.4th 142, 163; moye, at p. 550.) 8 caljic no. 9.90, the predecessor pattern jury instruction to calcrim no. 810, cruel or extreme pain and suffering [for the purpose of [revenge] [,] extortion[,] 9 during closing argument, the prosecutor properly identified the three elements necessary to reduce a murder to voluntary manslaughter based on provocation. the might cause someone to act rashly, might cause someone to become very upset. but would it cause someone to immediately start tying, tying up someone, shove a ball in and defense counsel would be able to counter with his own argument. the prosecutor instructions pertaining to adequate provocation during his closing argument. persons now contends the prosecutor misstated the law when, after acknowledging allegations of child molestation may provoke a reasonable person to act rashly, he then may have been sufficient provocation were unreasonable. (see people v. bell (1989) 49 cal.3d 502, 538 [during closing argument people v. mendoza (2007) 42 cal.4th 686, 702 [same].) the surrounding circumstancesand whether it was sufficient to cause a reasonable person to act rashly. how the killer responded to the provocation and the reasonableness of the response is not people v. najera (2006) 138 cal.app.4th 212, 223; see ibid. [prosecutor misstated law of provocation during closing argument a reasonable person would do what the defendant didshown].) the people argue najera was wrongly decided and conflicts with statements in other cases suggesting the provocation must be sufficient not only to cause the defendant people v. lee 10 (1999) 20 cal.4th 47, 59; accord, people v. waidla (2000) 22 cal.4th 690, 740, fn. 17 to arouse a reasonable person to make the kind of sudden and devastating attack that he participated in we need not resolve the question whether the prosecutor misstated the law of provocation9 because, even if he did, the error was harmless. (see people v. ochoa (1998) 19 cal.4th 353, 427 [when claim of misconduct is based on arguments or comments the prosecutor made to the jury, the question of prejudice is determined by complained-people v. morales (2001) 25 cal.4th 34, 47 [same].) the jury was instructed with calcrim no. 570, which follows sufficient, consider whether a person of average disposition, in the same situation and 10 the jury was also instructed with calcrim 200 informing them they must follow the presume the jury understood and followed the instructions given. (people v. yeoman (2003) 31 cal.4th 93, 139.) furthermore, the jury found persons guilty of torture. accordingly, under the felony murder rule, a properly instructed jury was required to (and did) find persons guilty of murder in the first degree. provocation is irrelevant to a conviction based on 9 whether the law of provocation considers exclusively the effect on a reasonable his or her actions in response to those circumstances is currently pending before the supreme court. (see people v. beltran (apr. 25, 2012, s192644) __ cal.4th __ [2012 cal. lexis 3937].) 10 the use note to calcrim no. 570 specifically cites people v. najera, supra, 138 erson need not have 11 felony murder. (see people v. seaton (2001) 26 cal.4th 598, 665 [because malice is not an element of felony murder, provocation -murder rule, a killing in the commission of certain felonies specified in [] 189 is first people v. cavitt (2004) 33 cal.4th 187, 197 [same]; calcrim no. people v. visciotti (1992) 2 cal.4th 1, 57, fn. perly given instructions that the murder was intentional, and was committed in the perpetration of robbery, thus establishing that the killing was murder of the first degree under the felony-murder rule and [] 189 without the necessity of proving malice. any error in failing to instruct on voluntary manslaughter was 4. jury instructions on aiding and abetting a premeditated murder were not improper; any error was harmless in any event the trial court instructed the jury with calcrim no. 400 (aiding and abetting), have directly committed the crime. i will call that person the perpetrator. two, he or she may have aided and abetted a perpetrator who directly committed the crime. [] a person is guilty of a crime whether he or she committed it personally or aided and abetted aids and abets a crime if he and he or she specifically intends to, and 521 (requirements of first degree premedidefendant is guilty of first degree murder if the people have proved that he acted persons contends this combination of jury instructions was legally deficient because it permitted the jury to find him guilty of aiding and abetting a premeditated murder even if it found he did not personally deliberate. (see people v. mccoy (2001) 12 25 cal.4th 1111, 1118 [when offense charged is murder, jury should be instructed that the coparticipant]; people v. samaniego (2009) 172 cal.app.4th 1148, 1164-1165 (samaniego) [same]; people v. nero (2010) 181 cal.app.4th 504, 518 (nero).) although we take 11 we need not address it because any error was plainly harmless even under the stringent beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard of chapman v. california (1967) 386 u.s. 18 [87 s.ct. 824, 17 l.ed.2d 705]. (see people v. delgado (2013) 56 cal.4th 480, 490 necessary findings, the error may be deemed equivalent to omitting an element of a chapman standard].) the jury was correctly informed, under both the natural and probable consequences doctrine and the felony murder rule, the only specific intent it was required to find to convict persons of first degree murder was the intent to commit torture. (see, e.g., people v. pearson (2012) 53 cal.4th 306, 321 [natural and probable consequences regardless of whether the defendant personally harbored the specific intent required for mccoy, supra, 25 cal.4th at p. 1118, fn. 1 [analysis concerning necessity of accomplice sharing same mens rea of perpetrator in connection with the homicide does not apply to natural and probable consequences doctrine, which looks to whether accomplice possesses specific intent to commit target offense]; people v. cavitt, supra, 33 cal.4th at p. 197 [the mental state required for 11 in contrast to the instruction at issue in samaniego and nero, the jury was not told if it found persons had aided and abetted the homicide, he and the actual perpetrator are samaniego, supra, 172 cal.app.4th at p. 1164; nero, supra, 181 cal.app.4th at p. 516.). rather, the jury was properly instructed it could find persons guilty of aiding and abetting premeditated murder only if purpose. this is a correct pronouncement of the law. 13 calcrim nos. 402 [natural and probable consequences] and 540a and 540b [felony murder].) the jury necessarily found persons possessed the specific intent to commit torture when it convicted him of that crime. accordingly, under either the natural and probable cause theory or the felony murder rule, it properly found him guilty of first degree murder. any error in the instructions on the specific intent required to convict for aiding and abetting a premeditated murder (a separate theory for first degree murder) is irrelevant to the verdict. disposition the judgment is affirmed. perluss, p. j. we concur: woods, j. zelon, j.
