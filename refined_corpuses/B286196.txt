(ibid.; people v. perez (2018) 19 cal.app.5th 818, 820.) within four months of the effective date of the statute, deras filed his motion for relief under section 1473.7, subdivision (a)(1). but the superior court denied the motion without prejudice under section 1473.7, subdivision (b), which sets forth the timeliness and due diligence requirements for motions filed in the face of federal removal proceedings. the superior court interpreted subdivision (b) as barring relief under the statute unless the moving party has suffered an actual adverse immigration consequence as a result of the conviction in the form of a removal order or a notice to appear in federal immigration court for removal proceedings. (see morales, supra, 25 cal.app.5th at pp. 504, 508.) 4 in our de novo review of the proper interpretation of section 1473.7, we adhere to the following guiding principles (in re r. t. (2017) 3 cal.5th 622, 627 (r. t.)): people v. brookfield (2009) 47 cal.4th 583, 592.) we start with the most reliable indicator of legislative intent: the statute. (r. t., supra, 3 cal.5th at p. 627.) while also taking account of any related provisions and the overall structure of the statutory scheme to determine what interpretation best ibid.) if the plain language supports more than one reasonable construction, we may also consider matters of public policy, legislative history, the evils to be remediedin discerning the legislature intent. (people v. lopez (2003) 31 cal.4th 1051, 1056.) statute should not be given a literal meaning if doing so would result in absurd consequences which the legislature did not prevails over the letter, and the letter will, if possible, be so read people v. broussard (1993) 5 cal.4th 1067, 1071.) with these principles in mind, we turn to the relevant provisions of section 1473.7.3 subdivision (a)(1) specifies the 3 a bill to amend section 1473.7, assembly bill no. 2867, was introduced on february 16, 2018. in its current iteration, motion pursuant to paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) shall be deemed timely filed at any time in which the individual filing the 5 class of persons entitled to seek relief under the statute and the grounds for relief: a person no longer imprisoned or restrained may prosecute a motion to vacate a conviction or sentence on the ground that he conviction or sentence is legally invalid due to meaningfully understand, defend against, or knowingly accept the actual or potential adverse immigration consequences of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere. subdivision (a)(1) thus authorizes a noncitizen to challenge a conviction which resulted from an error that compromised her ability to address the actual or potential adverse immigration consequencesof the plea. (italics added.) the sole limitation is that the moving party no longer be in criminal custody for the conviction that is subject to the motion to vacate. section 1473.7, subdivision (b) pertains to one of several possible adverse immigration consequences that might result from a conviction: federal removal proceedings. subdivision (b) states shall be filed with reasonable diligence after the later of the following: [] (1) the date the moving party receives a notice to appear in immigration court or other notice from immigration authorities that asserts the conviction or sentence as a basis for removal. [] (2) the date a removal order against the moving party, based on 4 assem. bill no. 2867, stats. 2018 (20172018 reg. sess.).) the bill is still pending in the legislature. 4 refers to removal proceedings under the immigration and nationality act. (8 c.f.r. 6 ( 1473.7, subd. (b)(1), (2), italics added.) subdivision (b) says nothing about the timeliness or due diligence required to prosecute a motion to vacate based on other actual or potential adverse immigration consequences, including those deras asserted: denial of naturalization or revocation of permanent resident status. indeed, as the court in morales observed, suprecise one, before which a motion must be filed if removal morales, supra, 25 cal.app.5th at p. 510.) thus, by construing subdivision (b) to bar deras from prosecuting his motion in the absence of removal proceedings, contradicted the plain language and broad terms of subdivision (a)(1), which contains no such limitation. reading the statute as a whole confirms its broad application. subdivision (e)(1) provides that the superior court shall grant the motion to vacate the conviction or sentence if the moving party establishes, by a preponderance of the evidence, the existence of any of the grounds for relief specified in subdivision (a) 1473.7, subd. (e)(1), italics added.) by explicitly requiring the court to grant a motion upon proof of any grounds specified in subdivision (a), the statute precludes denial of the motion on the ground that the moving party is not subject to removal. result. as in morales  1001.1(b).) the circumstances under which an order of removal made by an immigration judge at the conclusion of proceedings becomes final are set forth at 8 code of federal regulations section 1241.1. 7 provision about timeliness and due diligence into one that guarantees delay and renders section 1473.7 ineffectual in many cases. a noncitizen would be prevented from filing a motion until the latest possible moment, e.g., after a removal order has become final. we can think of no rational reason why the legislature would prevent a noncitizen facing removal from filing a motion that might be dispositive of the matter until the completion of all removal proceedings, when authorities could very well remove the (morales, supra, 25 cal.app.5th at p. 510.) finally, tafoul of the clear legislative intent underlying section 1473.7. (assem. bill no. 813.) was specifically intended to address a gap in existing law, which had prevented noncitizens who were no longer incarcerated from seeking a writ of habeas corpus to obtain relief from the adverse immigration consequences of convictions based on guilty pleas. ssem. bill no. 813, stats. 2016, ch. 739 (20152016 reg. sess.); morales, supra, 25 cal.app.5th at pp. 511512.) the digest thus declared that the new law would [] an explicit right for a person no longer imprisoned or restrained to file a motion to vacate a conviction or sentence based on a prejudicial error damaging to ability to meaningfully understand, defend against, or knowingly accept the actual or potential adverse immigration consequences of a plea of guilty or assem. bill no. 813, supra; morales, supra, 25 cal.app.5th at p. 512.) nothing in the legislative materials indicates that removal proceedings were the adverse immigration consequencescontemplated by the legislature in enacting this law. 8 based on our reading of the statute as a whole, our review of its language and legislative history, and endeavoring to avoid absurd results, we conclude the superior court erred as a matter n to vacate his conviction under section 1473.7 on the ground that he had neither received a removal order nor was he subject to removal proceedings at the time of the hearing on the motion. disposition the order denying the motion to vacate pursuant to section 1473.7 is reversed, and the matter is remanded to the superior court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. not to be published. lui, p. j. we concur: chavez, j. hoffstadt, j.
