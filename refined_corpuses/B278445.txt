(a) & 664),1 and (2) making a criminal threat ( 422, subd. (a)). a jury convicted defendant of both counts. the trial court imposed a sentence of 18 months on the attempted carjacking count and imposed (but stayed under section 654) a 16-month sentence on the criminal threats count. defendant filed this timely appeal. discussion defendant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence underlying both counts. in evaluating such challenges, we ask whether the record contains enough evidence that is reasonable, credible, and of solid value for a reasonable trier of fact to find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. (people v. brooks (2017) 2 cal.5th 674, 729.) in so doing, we look to the entire record, construing it in the light most favorable to the accept[ing] [all] logical inferences that the jury might have drawn from the evidence.people v. salazar (2016) 63 cal.4th 214, 242.) i. attempted carjacking to convict a defendant of carjacking, the people must prove another son or immediate presence . . . permanently or temporarily deprive the person in possession of , subd.

(people v. morante (1999) 20 cal.4th 403, 419.) defendant asserts that there is insufficient evidence that he specifically intended to commit a carjacking. we disagree. side door, ordered the car down after escobar drove away. from this evidence, a reasonable jury could find that defendant specifically intended to hwanted to hurt him, or else; defendant also points out that there was no evidence defendant attempted a second carjacking that day. contrary to what defendant implies, ve view of what defendant wanted is not controlling. iwell as the other evidence surrounding the crime in assessing . we declireweigh the evidence (people v. prunty (2015) 62 cal.4th 59, 89), substantial evidence. further, the absence of a second attempted carjacking does not call into question the sufficiency of the evidence regarding his intent to commit the charged attempted carjacking. ii. criminal threat to convict a defendant of making a criminal threat, the to commit a crime which will result in death or great bodily 5 injury to another person,threat, even if there is no intent of actually carrying it out(3) stances in which it [was] made, . . . so unequivocal, unconditional, immediate, and specific as to convey to the person threatened, a gravity of purpose and an immediate prospect of execution of the threat,caused the person threbe in sustained fear for his or her own safety or for his or her people v. toledo (2001) 26 cal.4th 221, 227-228;  422, subd. (a).) defendant contends that there is insufficient evidence (1) immediate, escobar was actually and reasonably in sustained fear (the fourth and fifth elements) because the entire crime lasted a matter of minutes. we disagree. a. sufficiently unequivocal and unconditional threat unequivocal, unconditional, immediate, and specific as to convey . . . a gravity of purpose and an immediate prospect of people v. culbert (2013) 218 cal.app.4th 184, 189-190; in re ricky t.

(e.g., in re ricky t., supra, 87 cal.app.4th at pp. 1134-,any prior history of disagreement, does not constitute an actionable thre 7 specifically referenced death and were immediately followed by the violent and repeated b. sustained fear in assessing whether a threat actually and reasonably placed the victeriod of time that extends beyond what is people v. allen (1995) 33 cal.app.4th 1149, 1156 (allen); people v. fierro (2010) 180 cal.app.4th 1342, 1349 (fierro); people v. wilson (2015) 234 cal.app.4th 193, 201.) here, escobar testified that his to feel he was in danger, and []hak[e defendant does not really dispute the genuineness of the fear because the entire interaction between himself and escobar lasted a matter of minutes this argument seems to rest on the premise that a minimum quantum of time. but no such absolute minimum exists. courts have held that fear lasting 15 minutes is sufficient. (fierro, suprawho hears someone say, i will kill you . . . right now, coupled with seeing a weapon, is quite justified in remaining scared shitless allen, supra, 33 cal.app.4th at p. utes of fear of a defendant who is armed, mobile, and at large, and who has threatened to kill the victim and her daughter, is more than sufficient to confear].) some courts have even held that a minute may be ves he is about to die, a minute is longer 8 fierro, at p. 1349.) in his threat, during his punching assault on the car, and as he chased escobar through the parking lot; indeed, escobar was still scared minutes later when he reported the crime to law enforcement and when defendant was still at large. s actually and reasonably more disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. ______________________, j. hoffstadt we concur: _________________________, acting p. j. chavez _________________________, j.* goodman * retired judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
