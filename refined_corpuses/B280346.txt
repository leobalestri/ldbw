( 211; 667, subd. (b)-(i); 1170.12, subds. (a)-(d).) defendant is presently serving that sentence. following the approvals by california voters of propositions 36 ( 1170.126) and 47 ( 1170.18), defendant filed petitions for relief under each initiative in the current case. his petition under proposition 36 was denied in march 2013,7 and his petition under proposition 47 was denied in february 2015.8 those determinations are now final. the present appeal is from the december 30, 2016 order oposition 57. in its december 30, 2016 order, the superior court explained that defendant is not entitled to resentencing under proposition 57 because that initiative 4 all further statutory references are to the penal code. 5 los angeles county superior court case no. a775937. 6 los angeles county superior court case no. a972586. 7 his wende appeal from the march 2013 ruling was dismissed in september 2013 (b248013). 8 ruling was denied in august 2015 (b264774). 4 completed his base term with a hearing before the board of parole hearings (cal. const., art. 1,  on april 7, 2017, dappellate counsel, sally p. brajevich, moved to augment the record with superior court documents from brajevich stated in relevant part that the additional documents included not guilty verdicts in case number a775937 obtained from the archives (one of the two strikes used to enhance the sentence) . . . brajevich argued that appellant was found not guilty of robbery in case no. a775937. . . since only two strike[s] were alleged in this case (ba140260), and only one strike was valid, appellant should have received a second strike sentence of a doubled term, not a third strike sentence of 25 years-to-(italics added.) we granted the motion to augment, partly in reliance on in case no. a775937. the additional documents were filed in this court on april 7, 2017. on july 12, 2017, brajevich filed a wende brief that raised no issues. inexplicably, the brief was silent as to cprevious assertion that, due to the number a775937, the three strikes sentence in this case was illegal. defendant filed a supplemental brief on august 3, 2017, arguing his sentence was illegal because of the not guilty verdicts in case no. a775937. in his supporting declaration, defendant stated unidentified person which stated5 case [no.]defendant requested a lie detector test, and provided internet news articles regarding the recent conviction of former sheriff lee baca. in his second supplemental brief, filed on august 18, 2017, defendant provided additional internet news articles regarding former sheriff baca. he also attached in the a775937 case (these are contained in the augmented record filed on april 7, 2017), and a subsequent unverified document (which is not part of the record in this case) purporting to reduce count 2 (receiving stolen property) in the a775937 case to a misdemeanor under proposition 47. based on these attachmentsthe a775937 case, and that his crime (he did not specify which count) was a misdemeanor. the first issuethat defendant received an unauthorized sentenceis one that may be raised at any time, because a sentence which is not authorized by law exceeds the jurisdiction of the court. (people v. neal (1993) 19 cal.app.4th 1114, 1164.) however, the claim is based on two un in the a775937 case. because both documents are unsigned, they are not the actual verdicts returned by the jury. accordingly, the record does not support received an unauthorized sentence in this case. as to the second issue, there conviction on count 1 (robbery) in the a775937 case was reduced to a misdemeanor. defendant has provided an unverified document which purports to show that count 2 (receiving stolen property) in the a775937 case was reduced to a misdemeanor. assuming that to be true, the reduction of count 2 to a misdemeanor does not assist defendant because count 2 was not 6 one of the prior strike convictions that supported his three strikes sentence in this case. the other issues raised by defendant have no bearing on the denial of his motion for resentencing under proposition 57. because proposition 57 does not provide for resentencing in the superior court, the motion was properrequests for a lie detector test and a rehearing based on the conviction of former sheriff baca are beyond the scope of the record. we have reviewed the record under people v. kelly (2006) 40 cal.4th 106, and are satisfied that there are no arguable issues.
