(a)) (count 4). as to all counts, the jury found true the gang enhancement ( 186.22, subd. (b)(1)). as to count 3, the jury also found true the allegation that another person other than an accomplice was present in the residence during the burglary ( 667.5, subd. (c)). in a bifurcated proceeding, the trial court found subds. (a)-(d), 667, subds. (b)-(i)) and one prior serious felony conviction ( 667, subd. (a)). the trial court sentenced appellant to a total of 23 years in state prison as follows: on count 3, the base term, the court selected the midterm of four years doubled to eight years for a second strike; plus five years for a prior serious felony conviction; plus 10 years for the gang enhancement. the court stayed the two-year midterm sentences on counts 1 and 2 and the three-year midterm sentence on count 4. appellant contends there was no substantial evidence to support his conviction for criminal threats against one of the victims (count 1) and that the trial court erred in failing to sua sponte instruct the jury on the lesser included offense of attempted criminal threats. we disagree and affirm. facts prosecution case gang, hit james kyles (kyles) in the face and robbed him. on september 23, 2008, kyles testified for the prosecution and against walzer at a preliminary hearing. at the end of april 2011, appellant, whom kyles knew to be a member of the 1 all further statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise indicated. 3 ouse was charles dutton (dutton), a member of the schoolyard crips. other members of the gang would drop by to see dutton, including appellant. on may 5, 2011, at about 11:30 p.m., kyles was at home sitting on a sofa with friends diamond and michelle. burns was upstairs. there was a knock on the door and burns went downstairs to answer. when she asked who was there, a person replied of the schoolyard crips. burns peered behind the curtains and asked crittendon if he -backpack in front of him and walked slowly into the house. appellant, who had been hiding behind him, followed him inside. oolyard. me. i will ould carry out his threat and ran upstairs. as she put on a robe, she heard appellant yelling downstairs. burns returned downstairs and saw appellant standing over kyles, who was still seated on the sofa. with clenched fists, appellant shouted at kyles, up and be a man in your house. and the next time i come to this house and hear of you your fucking teeth down your throat. do you want me to knock your fucking teeth down 4 get up from the sofa. appellant lant was about to hurt him. kyles later testified on cross-examination following a weekend recess that after appellant threatened kyles understood this to mean that nothing would happen at that time burns went across the street and called the police, who arrested appellant. after the police left, diamond punched kyles in the nose, drawing blood. diamond said that about one and a half months before trial in this matter, walzer came to the house, police; instead, she asked walzer to leave and he complied. the incident scared burns and she left a voice mail for the investigating officer. crittendon also came by the same month and threatened burns. los angeles police department (lapd) officer john maloney testified as a gang expert. he was familiar with the schoolyard crips, which has around 200 members. the narcotic sales, vandalism, and graffiti. appellant is a self-admitted member of the schoolyard cwhen asked a hypothetical question based on the evidence presented at trial, officer maloney opined that the threats were made for the benefit of, at the direction of, and in association with the schoolyard crips as a means of instilling fear, and would promote and assist the gang by deterring residents from reporting crimes committed by gang members. 5 defense case appellant called two lapd officers. officer edgar bacilio testified that he went to the scene in response to the call made by burns. kyles told him that appellant pushed burns to the ground when he entered their house. kyles also recounted that when appellant confronted him, burns tried to intervene and was again pushed to the ground. on cross-examination, officer bacilio testified that as he talked to kyles about the his . . wanted officer nestor escobar, who also responded to the scene, testified that burns told him appellant pushed her to the ground; she also said that appellant told kyles he would kill him. on cross-examination, officer escobar testified that kyles told him he believed discussion i. standard of review when determining whether the evidence is sufficient to sustain a conpeople v. ochoa (1993) 6 cal.4th 1199, 1206.) we review the entire record in the light most favorable to the judgment to determine whether a rational trier of fact could find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. (ibid.) we presume in support of the judgment the existence of every fact that a trier of fact could reasonably deduce from the evidence. (ibid.) this standard applies whether direct or circumstantial evidence is involved. (people v. thompson (2010) 49 cal.4th 79, 113.) (people v. maury (2003) 30 cal.4th 342, 403.) even when there is a significant amount of countervailing evidence, the testimony of a single witness can be sufficient to uphold a conviction. (people v. barnwell (2007) 41 cal.4th 1038, 1052.) so long as the circumstances reasonably justify the court that the circumstances might also reasonably be reconciled with a contrary finding 6 does not warrant reversal of the judgment. (people v. albillar (2010) 51 cal.4th 47, 60; people v. rodriguez (1999) 20 cal.4th 1, 11.) reversal is not warranted unless it appears people v. bolin (1998) 18 cal.4th 297, 331.) ii. substantial evidcount 1 substantial evidence to support a conviction for criminal threats in count 1. we disagree. a. applicable law to prove a violation of section 422, the prosecution must establish all of the result in . . is to be taken as a threat, even if which may bface and under the circumstances in which it [was] made, . . . so unequivocal, unconditional, immediate, and specific as to convey to the person threatened, a gravity of people v. toledo (2001) 26 cal.4th 221, 227228.) the jury was so instructed. (caljic no. 9.94.) absolutely unequivocal, unconditional, immediate, and specific. the statute includes the qualifier surrounding circumstances, the communication was sufficiently unequivocal, unconditional, immediate, and specific as to convey to the victim a gravity of purpose 7 in re ryan d. (2002) 100 people v. butler (2000) 85 cal.app.4th 745, 753.) in deciding whether a communication constitutes a threat, the court considers the communication on its face and in the context of its surrounding circumstances. (people v. bolin, supra, 18 cal.4th at pp. 339340; people v. mendoza can be considered as one of the relevant circumstances]; see also people v. gaut (2002) 95 cal.app.4th 1425, 14311432 [threat followed lengthy history of threatening and physically assaulting victim]; people v. solis (2001) 90 cal.app.4th 1002, 1014 [threat threat does not have to include details about the time or precise manner of execution. (people v. butler, supra, 85 cal.app.4th at p. 752.) a victim must actually be in sustained fear, and the sustained fear must be reasonable under the circumstances. (in re ricky t. (2001) 87 cal.app.4th 1132, 11391140.) although neither section 422 nor case law has fixed the length of time required people v. allen (1995) 33 cal.app.4th 1149, 1156; see also people v. fierro (2010) 180 cal.app.4th 1342, 1349 [holding that element of sustained fear was met during a one-minute incident where the b. substantial evidence ain his conviction cross-is statement to mean that appellant was not going to hurt him at that time. according to appellant, this but appellant ignores the remaining evidence. (see people v. johnson (1980) 26 whole record . . . and may 8 he would be harmed in some way, and he was afraid. on the night of may 5, 2011, threatened to knock her teeth down her throat. after she fled upstairs, appellant turned his attention to kyles. appellant stood over kyles, who was seated, and shouted at him with clenched fists, threatening to knock othreats seriously. as appe two police officers who responded to the scene found kyles trembling and scared. officer bacilio thought kyles almost wanted to cry, and officer escobar testified that culture of gangs and the emphasis gang members place on retaliation and respect. evidence and the credibility of witnesses. we are not permitted to do so. (people v. maury, supra, 30 cal.4th at p. favorable to the judgment below to determine whether it discloses substantial evidencethat is, evidence which is reasonable, credible, and of solid valuesuch that a reasonable people v. johnson, supra, 26 cal.3d at p. 578.) under the circumstances here, we are convinced 9 iii. no error in failing to instruct on lesser included offense of attempted criminal threat appellant contends the trial court committed reversible error in failing to sua sponte instruct the jury on the lesser included offense of attempted criminal threat. we disagree. attempted criminal threat is a lesser included offense of the crime of criminal threat. (people v. toledo, supra, 26 cal.4th at p. 230.) the duty to instruct on a lesser elements of the charged offense were present [citation], but not when there is no evidence that the offense people v. barton (1995) 12 cal.4th 186, 194any instructions on a lesser included offense, . . people v. breverman (1998) 19 cal.4th 142, 162; see also people v. cole (2004) 33 cal.4th 1158, 1218; people v. memro (1995) 11 cal.4th 786, 871.) thus, when there is no evidence that the offense committed was less than that charged, there is no duty to instruct on lesser included offenses. (people v. cruz (2008) 44 cal.4th 636, 664.) we review de novo an alleged failure by a trial court to instruct on a lesser included offense. (people v. waidla (2000) 22 cal.4th 690, 733.) appellant argues that the jury should have been instructed on the lesser included dict on the completed offense of criminal threat, the trial court did not err in failing to instruct on the lesser charge. 10 disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. ______________________________, j. ashmann-gerst we concur: _______________________________, p. j. boren _______________________________, j. chavez
