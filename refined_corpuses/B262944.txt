[section] 484e requires the element includes obtaining access card information with the intent to use it. and the court believes the specific language of 484e(d) falls outside the scope of proposition 47. ] language of . . . section 530.5, which was not included as an eligible crime under prop. 47, so the petition will be denied. 2. violation of section 484e(d) not embraced by proposition 47 comparing the elements of section 490.2(a) with those of section 484e(d), the conclusion arises that the offenses defined in these two sections are distinct and different from each other. for this reason, we conclude a violation of section 484e(d) cannot be shoehorned into a violation of section 490.2(a) for the purposes of proposition 47 relief.6 pursuant to proposition 47, section 490.2(a) provides: notwithstanding section 487 or any other provision of law defining grand theft, obtaining any property by theft where the value of the money, labor, real or personal property taken does not exceed nine hundred fifty dollars ($950) shall be considered petty theft and shall be punished as a who acquires or retains possession of access card account information with respect to an with the intent to use it fraudulently, is guilty of grand theft. (italics added.) 6 this issue is pending before our supreme court in various cases. (see, e.g., people v. cuen (s231107, formerly (2015) 241 cal.app.4th 1227); people v.romanowski (s231405, formerly (2015) 242 cal.app.4th 151); people v. grayson (s231757, formerly (2015) 241 cal.app.4th 454); people v. king (s231888, formerly (2015) 242 cal.app.4th 1312); people v. thompson (s232212, formerly (2015) 243 cal.app.4th 413).) in a letter brief filed may 19, 2016, respondent cited to people v. solis as authority for its positsolis. (s234150, formerly (2016) 245 cal.app.4th 1099.) 6 the key elements of a violat . . . . . . the access card account information associated with an access card. there is no value element to that offense. additionally, there is no requirement in section 484e(d) that or any financial or other loss to the cardholder. (see people v. molina (2004) 120 cal.app.4th 507, 512, 516 [ 484e(d) does not require actual use; the account of an the fraudule]; calcrim no. 1952.) in view of the above, we conclude that section 484e(d) does not define an offense that is embraced by section 490.2(a) for which proposition 47 relief is afforded. 3. no denial of due process shown defendant contends her right to due process was violated when the trial court convicted her of a crime which she was not charged with or received notice of. she has failed to demonstrate her right to due process was abridged. the fallacy of her position lies in her fatally flawed premise that at the hearing on her proposition 47 petition, the 530.5) rather than grand theft under section analogize her conviction for violating section 484e(d) as a violation of section 530.5, which defines the offense of identity theft, rather than as a violation of section 490.2(a), which defines the offense of grand theft of property whose value does not exceed $950 as a misdemeanor. (see people v. thurston (1999) 71 cal.app.4th 1050, 1054 [comparing crimes to determine intent element of spousal abuse].) conclusion er felony sentence and resentence as a misdemeanor. she failed to satisfy her threshold burden to establish she would have been guilty of a misdemeanor under [proposition 47] . . . had 7 conviction for violating section 484e(d) does not qualify as a misdemeanor under section 490.2(a) for which proposition 47 relief is available. defendant also failed to establish any abridgment of her right to due process. disposition the order appealed from is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. boren, p.j. we concur: chavez, j. hoffstadt, j.
