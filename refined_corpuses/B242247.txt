(stats. 1982, ch. 1551,  1.5, pp. 6048, 6049.) over the years, this former subdivision (e) was amended several more times, sometimes in ways irrelevant here, but sometimes to add more crimes for which the trial court could impose both a weapon enhancement and a great-bodily-injury enhancement. (stats. 1986, ch. 1429,  1, pp. 5124, 51255126 [adding penetration of a genital or anal opening by a foreign object, oral copulation, and sodomy, as well as an attempt to commit those crimes, and attempted murder]; stats. 1988, ch. 1487,  2, pp. 5272, 52735274 [adding lewd or lascivious acts upon or with a child under the age of 14 years accomplished by means of force or fear and kidnapping, as well as an attempt to commit those crimes]; stats. 1992, ch. 235,  1, pp. 1029, 1031 [adding sexual battery and attempted sexual battery]; stats. 1993, ch. 611,  17, pp. 3523, 3525 people v. ahmed, supra, 53 cal.4th at p.166, italics added.) disposition the judgment is affirmed. the superior court is directed to prepare and forward to the department of corrections and rehabilitation an amended abstract of judgment (count 2) to a life term plus five years for the firearm-use enhancement, plus three years 5 pronouncement of judgment. woods, j. we concur: perluss, p. j. zelon, j.
