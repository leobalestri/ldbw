(pen. code,  1170.126.)1 appellant contends the trial court erred in determining that appellant was ineligible for recall and resentencing under section 1170.126 ed during the commission of the crime of possession of a firearm by a felon.2 we disagree and affirm and resentence him as a second strike offender. factual and procedural background on april 30, 1995, appellant attempted to enter a nightclub in long beach, but was stopped at the door by two security guards. appellant left the nightclub, but pulled up three or four minutes later in a car and motioned for the security guards to leave their post to talk with him. and saw the handle of a handgun under a towel on the passenger appellant was detained, and police recovered a loaded .38-caliber revolver from the front pas in september 1995, a jury convicted appellant of possession of a firearm by a felon. ( 12021, subd. (a)(1).) the jury also found true allegations that appellant had suffered three prior convictions under the three strikes law ( 667, subds. (b)(i), 1170.12, subds. (a)(d)) and had served one prior prison term ( 667.5, subd. (b)). the trial court sentenced appellant to a third-strike term of 25 years to life in prison pursuant to the three strikes law.3 1 undesignated statutory references are to the penal code. 2 former section 12021, subdivision (a)(1), now codified as section 29800, subdivision (a)(1). 3 on december in a nonpublished opinion, b099211. 3 on february 15, 2013, appellant filed a petition in the trial court for recall of his sentence and for resentencing as a second strike offender under proposition 36. court denied the petition on the ground (c)(2)(c)(iii), 1170.126, subd. (e)(2).) discussion appellant is ineligible for resentencing because he was armed during the commission of the offense of possession of a firearm by a felon a. the three strikes reform act of 2012 on november 6, 2012, california voters passed proposition 36, the three strikes reform act of 2012 (the act), which amended the three strikes law with respect to defendants whose current conviction (the offense for which the third-strike sentence was imposed) is for a felony that is neither serious nor violent. (people v. johnson (2015) 61 cal.4th 674, 679, 681 (johnson); people v. burnes (2015) 242 cal.app.4th 1452, 14571458; people v. yearwood (2013) 213 cal.app.4th 161, 167168.) the act amended sections 667 and 1170.12, and added section 1170.126, subdivision (b), authorizing a prisoner serving a third-strike indeterminate life sentence to petition the trial court for recall of the sentence and for resentencing as a second-strike offender. (johnson, at pp. 679680.) not every third-strike offender whose current offense is neither serious nor violent qualifies for resentencing under the act, however. the act disqualifies any inmate whose current offense was any of several specified crimes [d]uring the commission of the current offense, the defendant was armed with a firearm or deadly weapon. ( 667, subd. (e)(2)(c)(iii), 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(c)(iii) johnson, supra, 61 cal.4th at p. 682; people v. osuna (2014) 225 cal.app.4th 1020, 10281029 (osuna); people v. brimmer (2014) 230 cal.app.4th 782, 791793.) 4 b. appellant was during the commission of the offense, and is therefore ineligible for relief under the act appellant contends that according to the plain language of the act, the ineligibility factors listed in subdivision (iii) must be construed as in addition to, and not simply coextensive with, the elements of the current offense. he asserts that both the statutory construction and a grammatical analysis of the statute support this interpretation, and asserts that because the act does not disqualify inmates serving sentences for mere gun possession, se if there is another offense to which the arming ethered,and that underlying offense. he concludes that an interpretation of the statute that allows a person to be considered armed with a firearm while committing the crime of possession of the we disagree. the basic s argument is his explicit assumption that the crime of possession of a firearm not so. while being armed with a firearm invariably involves possession, the reverse is not always true. former section previously convicted of a felony to own or have in his or her possession or under his or her custody or control, any firearm. the elements of this offense are conviction of a felony and ownership or knowing possession, custody, or control of a firearm. (people v. blakely (2014) 225 cal.app.4th 1042, 1052 (blakely); osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1029; people v. snyder (1982) 32 cal.3d 590, 592.) a defendant possesses a weapon when it is under his dominion and control. [citation.] a defendant has actual possession when the weapon is in his immediate possession or control. he has constructive possession when the weapon, while not in his actual possession, is nonetheless under his dominion and control, either directly or through others. implicitly, the crime is committed the instant the felon in any way ha (osuna, supra, at pp. 1029 5 1030; see also henderson v. united states (2015) ___ u.s. ___, ___ [135 s.ct. 1780, 1784] [actual possession of a firearm exists when a person has direct physical control over the firearm, whereas constructive possession occurs when a person still has the power and intent to exercise control over the firearm, while lacking such physical custody].) a construed to mean having a firearm available for use, either offensively or defensively. (e.g.,  1203.06, subd. (b)(3); health & saf. code,  11370.1, subd. (a); people v. bland (1995) 10 cal.4th 991, 997 (blandosuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1029; people v. pitto (2008) 43 cal.4th 228, 236; people v. mendival (1992) 2 cal.app.4th 562, 574 the ready accessof the weapon that s dominion and control without it being available for use.osuna, at p. 1030.) accordingly, because possessing a firearm does not necessarily constitute being armed with a firearm, a defendant whose current offense is mere possession of a firearm by a felon is not automatically ineligible for resentencing by virtue of that conviction. (blakely, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1052; people v. elder (2014) 227 cal.app.4th 1308, 1313 (elder); people v. white (2014) 223 cal.app.4th 512, 524 (white).) relying on the 12022,4 appellant asserts that bland (see bland, supra, 10 cal.4th at pp. 999, 10011003; see also osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1031.) thus, according to appellant, the definition of arming includes an underlying offense beyond the substantive offense of possession alone. 4 section 12022 provides for the imposition of an additional and consecutive term arming is an element of the offense. (bland, supra, 10 cal.4th at p. 995.) 6 as other courts have observed in responding to the same argument, however, enhancementan additional term of imprisonment added to the base term, for which a defendant cannot be punished until and unless convicted of a related s(people v. hicks (2014) 231 cal.app.4th 275, 283 (hicks); osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1030.) criterial definition of an ineligible offense (being armed during the commission of such offense) with the derivative nature of the armed enhancement (which requires being armed in elder, supra, 227 cal.app.4th at p. 1313; see also osuna, at pp. 10311032.) appellant criticizes osuna and cases following it for drawing a distinction during in bland in the context of section 12022. as osuna explained: d3d new internat. dict. (1986) p. 703.) in other words, it requires a temporal nexus between the arming and the underlyiosuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1032.) according to appellant, this is a distinction without a difference because the two wordsare frequently used interchangeably. but the california supreme court has explained that the statutory used in section 12022 requires arming take place during the underlying crime and that it have some facilitative nexus to that (bland, supra, 10 cal.4th at p. 1002, second italics added; in re tameka c. (2000) 22 cal.4th 190, 197similarly, we have a felony, as used in section 12022.5, means during and in furtherance of the felony, italics added].) o trigger the enhancement, the defendant need only available for use to further the commission ([bland,] at p. 999.)people v. becker (2000) 83 cal.app.4th 294, 297, italics added.) 7 as the courts in osuna, elder, hicks, and brimmer held, we also conclude that during does not require a facilitative nexus between arming and the underlying offense. rather, ineligibility for relief under the act occurs when the arming is contemporaneous with the current offense, but does not necessarily further or aid in the commission of that offense. since the act uses the phrase [d]uring the com and not in the commission of the current offense ([subdivision (iii)]), and since at issue is not the imposition of additional punishment but rather eligibility for reduced punishment, we conclude the literal language of the act disqualifies an inmate from resentencing if he or she was armed with a firearm during the unlawful possession of that firearm.osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1032; elder, supra, 227 cal.app.4th at pp. 13121313; hicks, supra, 231 cal.app.4th at p. 284; brimmer, supra, 230 cal.app.4th at p. 799.) in the present case, the evidence adduced at trial established that appellant had a loaded firearm next to him on the passenger seat of his vehicle. appellant was thus in actual, not constructive, possession of a firearm. because the weapon was available for use at any timand is ineligible for relief under the act. (bland, supra, 10 cal.4th at pp. 999, 10011003; see also osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1031.) appellant acknowledges that appellate courts have consistently rejected his argument that the factors listed in subdivision (iii) must be tethered to another offense, weapon. he contends, however, that these cases were wrongly decided, and invites us to be available and have a facilitative nexus to the crime upon which the defendant has been sentenced. we join the consensus among california courts that the ineligibility factor of being armed with a firearm during the commission of the current offense applies whenever the record shows the defendant was in actual physical possession of the firearm, and therefore decline appellan. 8 -appellant further argues that it is inconsistent with the purpose of the act to construe subdivision (iii) to deny relief to anyone who had access to a weapon during the commission of a nonviolent crime without requiring that such access be for the purpose of furthering another criminal act. we disagree. that govern statutory construction. (people v. rizo (2000) 22 cal.4th 681, the fundamental purpose of statutory construction is to ascertain the intent of [citation.] we begin with the language of the statute, to which we give its ordinary meaning and construe in the context of the statutory scheme. if the language is ambiguous, we look to other indicia of voter intent. johnson, supra, 61 cal.4th at p. 682; blakely, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1053.) as set forth above, we find that the act explicitly disqualifies any inmate from resentencing who was armed with a firearm during the unlawful possession of that firearm. (osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1032.) moreover, our reading of the act comports w the resentencing relief to low-risk, nonviolent inmates serving life sentences for petty crimes, such as shoplifting and simple drug possession. (voter information guide, [gen. elec. (nov. 6, 2012)] text of prop. 36,  white, supra, 223 cal.app.4th at p. 526.) it is clear s intent was not to throw open the prison doors to all third strike offenders whose current convictions were not for serious or violent felonies, but only to those who were perceived as nondangerous or posing little or no risk to the public. a felon who has been convicted of two or more serious and/or violent felonies in the past, and most recently had a firearm readily available for use, simply does not pose little or no risk to the public.osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1038.) bland, supra, 10 cal.4th at p. 997; brimmer, supra, 230 cal.app.4th at p. 799.) in light of the fact that appellant was armed with a firearm during the commission of his offense, he does not fall 9 into the category of a low-risk, nonviolent offender, and his crime cannot be deemed a petty or minor crime for purposes of resentencing under the act. the trial court properly determined that appellant is ineligible for recall and resentencing under proposition 36. disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published. lui, j. we concur: rothschild, p. j. johnson, j.
