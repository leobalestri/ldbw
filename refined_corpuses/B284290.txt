and (3) his trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective. because each of these arguments lacks merit, we affirm his convictions and sentence and deny his petition for habeas relief. facts and procedural background i. facts a. incidents 1. first incident in late october 2015, defendant walked into a perfume store owned by yeny g., a woman in her late 30s, just a few minutes before the store was to close. he said he was a police ed a badge that looked real but and insisted that he needed to search the store. defendant 3 surveillance system. he then ordered her to stand facing the shoulder, waist and legs. he next ordrestroom and to strip down to her bra and panties. when she hesitated, he opened his jacket to flash the gun holstered on his left and then to the right so he could see her profile. yeny explained it was her ex-husband, and defendant told her to answer her phone and tell him to leave. she did as instructed, but the ex-husband remained at the front door of the store. defendant gathered up approximately $1,200 in cash, six bottles of perfume worth $40-camera that was worth approximately $300, and walked out the 2. second incident just shy of four weeks later, defendant approached ani b., a then-24-year-old ucla student, as she was digging for her keys in her belongings on the unlit porch of her hollywood apartment complex just after midnight. defendant told her that accused her of having drugs. when ani walked to a better lit bench to show defendant the contents of her bags, defendant beckoned her back to the unlit doorway, asked her if she lived alone, and asked her what was in an even darker alcove behind a nearby gate. defendant then ordered her to stand facing a wall, and proceeded to grope her hips, her buttocks, and the sides of 4 her breasts. when ani asked defendant what he was doing, he at her, and told her that he would shoot if she screamed. ani nevertheless rang the doorbell and her roommate came to the door. defendant left. within hours of the incident and over the next few days, he also searched for and watched videos on 3. third incident on november 28, 2015, defendant used his cell phone to ays to get away with two days later, defendant pulled up alongside then 24-year-old ursula s. while driving a car with heavily tinted windows as she was stopped at a light around midnight. defendant followed ursula to the carport of her apartment and approached her car from behind. he pressed a badge to her window and, when she rolled down her window, told her that her tags were invalid. as he put away his badge, ursula saw a gun holstered on his hip. defendant asked if she had any drugs in her car and demanded that she open her trunk so he could search then announced that he needed to search her and proceeded to grab her buttocks twice and grope along her inner and outer thighs. defendant then accidentally bumped up against the 5 adjacent car and set off the alarm; he and walked away. within a few days after the incident, defendant used his cell phone to access articles regarding a man impersonating a police officer fondling two women in the hollywood area. b. in a storage locker used police recraid jacket, a pair of handcuffs, and a wallet containing several different los angeles police department and california department of justice badges and identity cards. in december 2015, police searresidence in anaheim, california, as well as his car. residence, police recovered zip ties, an empty gun case and cleaning kit, a magazine loaded with bullets, replica license d a fake police from a police scanner. ii. procedural background a. charges in the operative, first amended information, the people charged defendant with ten crimes. with respect to the first incident involving yeny g., the people charged defendant with (1) second degree commercial burglary (pen. code,  459)1 (count 7); (2) false imprisonment by violence ( 236) (count 8), (3) unlawful use of a badge, a misdemeanor ( 538d, subd. (b)(2)) (count 9), 1 all further statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise indicated. 6 and (4) grand theft of personal property ( 487, subd. (a)) (count 10). with respect to the second incident involving ani b., the people charged defendant with (1) assault with intent to commit rape ( 220, subd.

(a)-(d), 667, subds. (b)-(j)) as well as prior b. verdicts and admissions the jury found defendant guilty of all charged offenses and firearm enhancements. defendant admitted his prior convictions. c. sentencing the trial court sentenced defendant to prison for 115 years to life. the court imposed 45 years to life for the assault with 7 intent to commit rape against ani b., comprised of a third strike sentence of 25 years to life, plus 10 years for personal use of a firearm, plus five years for each prior serious felony. the court imposed an identical 45-year sentence for the false imprisonment by violence count against yeny g. the court imposed 25 years to life for the false imprisonment by violence count against ursula s. the court ordered these sentences to run consecutively. the court imposed sentences of 25 years to life on the remaining felonies but stayed them pursuant to section 654. the court imposed terms in the county jail for the three misdemeanor counts, but also stayed them pursuant to section 654. d. appeal defendant filed a timely notice of appeal. e. petition for a writ of habeas corpus defendant also filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. we subsequently issued an order by which we would consider the appeal. discussion direct appeal i. denial of motion to suppress a. pertinent facts because all three incidents occurred in los angeles, the los angeles police department (lapd) investigated them. when the lapd identified defendant as the perpetrator and sought to search his residence in anaheim (which is in orange county), the lead investigator presented her search warrant application to an orange county judge. the judge signed the warrant, and lapd officers executed it. no orange county-based peace officers were involved. 8 prior to trial, defendantwhile representing himselffiled a motion to suppress the evidence seized from his home and his car. he argued that the orange county judge did not have the authority to issue a warrant to peace officers from a different county for a crime that occurred in that different county. after considering the that (2) suppression was not warranted because the lapd was meaning of united states v. leon (1984) 468 u.s. 897 (leon). b. analysis defendant argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress. we independently review both the application of the law to undisputed facts (people v. gonzales & soliz (2011) 52 cal.4th 254, 284), and the applicability of leongood faith exception (people v. lazarus (2015) 238 cal.app.4th 734, 767). that the magistrate erred in issuing a warrant in this case. by people v. emanuel (1978) 87 cal.app.3d 205, 211-212.) what is more, as long as the crime being investigated occurred in the county, the magistrate may issue a search warrant to officers in his or her county for a location anywhere within the state of california. (people v. fleming (1981) 29 cal.3d 698, 703-704 (fleming) 9 is a magistrate authorized to issue a warrant to peace officers from a different county for a crime that occurred in that different county? the answer is no 528, subd. (a); accord, people v. galvan (1992) 5 cal.app.4th 866, 869-870 (galvan) [a magistrate may not issue a search warrant to officers from a different county even if the location to be searched and the underlying crime ounty].) we nevertheless conclusion that the error in this case falls squarely within leon leon exclusionary rule generally does not require the suppression of reliance on a search warrant that is issued by a detached and people v. willis ch a] warrant in leon itself: (1) when the affiant knowingly or recklessly included or omitted material information in the affidavit supporting the search warrant; (2) when the magistrain indicia of probable cause as to render official belief in its o particularize the place to be searched or the things to be seized [] that the (people v. dantzler (1988) 206 cal.app.3d 289, 294; leon, supra, 468 u.s. at p. 923; cf. people v. gotfried (2003) 107 cal.app.4th 10 254, 264-265 people v. hirata (2009) 175 cal.app.4th 1499, 1508 [same].) here, the officers relied upon a warrant that does not fit within any of leon, the california courtsincluding our supreme courthave repeatedly noted that the failure to comply with the inter-county territorial rules, leonpeople v. ruiz (1990) 217 cal.app.3d 574, 586-587; galvan, supra, 5 cal.app.4th at pp. 870, 872; fleming, supra, 29 cal.3d at pp. 703-704.) defendant cites several cases for the proposition that leoncases involved a warrantless search and thus did not involve the application of leon-friendly rule. (people v. ivey (1991) 228 cal.app.3d 1423, 1426; people v. ingham (1992) 5 cal.app.4th 326, 333-334; miranda v. superior court (1993) 13 cal.app.4th 1628, 1629-1630.) ii. denial of pitchess motion 1. pertinent facts prior to trial, defendantagain, while representing himselffiled a motion (1) seeking the personnel records of 19 of excessive force, planting of evidence, false or misleading internal reports, or any other evidence of misconduct amounting to moral turpitude,which police agency fhis front door. red front door to get his attention. 11 motion, defendant elaborated that the police engaged in misconduct by (1) unlawfully detaining him, (2) unlawfully searching his residence outside of their jurisdiction, and (3) shooting at his front door. motion for disclosure of personnel records finding that there was b. analysis defendant argues that the trial court erred in denying his pitchess motion for the disclosure of personnel records. (he does not appeal the refusal to order an investigation.) we review the denial of pitchess motion for an abuse of discretion. (people v. breaux (1991) 1 cal.4th 281, 311-312.) conditionally privileged under california law. ( 832.5, 832.7, 832.8.) this conditional privilege is overcome only if the party seeking them follows the procedures first articulated in pitchess, supra, 11 cal.3d 531, and later codified in evidence code section 1043 through 1047. under these procedures, a court must find that is, a showing that the agency from which the records and complaints are sought possesses them and, more relevant here, a showing that the subd. (b)(3).) to establish materiality, the requesting party must of officer and (2) must establish both how the information action and how the information would support a defense or warrick v. superior court (2005) 35 12 cal.4th 1011, 1021, 1025-1027; california highway patrol v. superior court (2000) 84 cal.app.4th 1010, 1021.) the trial court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the personnel records defendant before the trial court, defendant articulated three possible ways in which the records might support a defense or negate the 19 named officers might support his position that the lapd unlawfully detained him, but arrests in public are valid as long as they are supported by probable cause (united states v. watson (1976) 423 u.s. 411, 418) and defendant never disputed the probable cause underlying his arrest. even if we assume that defendant was implicitly suggesting that all 19 officers involved some suggestion as to why they would single him out. (people v. thompson (2006) 141 cal.app.4th 1312, 1317-1319.) second, defendant stated that the personnel records would support his position that his search warrant was issued by the wrong magistrate. this issue, as defendant conceded before the trial court, turned on undisputed facts to which the personnel records would add nothing. lastly, defendant stated that the personnel records would support his claim that the officers used excessive force by firing at his front door. but none of the charges against defendant has anything to do with that use of force; that issue is accordingly irrelevant to any charge or defense. on appeal, defendant simply states that he this statement is conclusory, and by itself does not demonstrate why the trial court 13 abused its discretion. defendant goes on to articulate two further issues to which he asserts the personnel records are material: (1) to show the character of the arresting officers for violence, which is admissible as a character trait of a victim under evidence code first issue is not material because the officers are not victims of any crime charged in this case. and the second issue is not material for the reasons explained abovechiefly, that the issues that are otherwise undisputed or irrelevant to the charges in this case. iii. admission of 1996 assault with intent to commit rape charge a. pertinent facts in 1996, defendant was convicted of assault with intent to commit rape ( 220). the people sought to admit this conviction to show the to commit the charged sex offenses pursuant to evidence code section 1108. defendant objected. the trial court overruled the objection. in so ruling, the court found that the admissibility of the 1996 conviction under evidence code section 1108 turned on whether it was appropriate to admit the conviction under evidence code section 352. on one because it was relevant to prove whether he assaulted ani b. with the intent to rape (or, instead, with some other intent). on the other side, the court found that this probative value was not ot custody . . . a significant 14 am would not the people subsequently introduced the conviction through court records, and the trial court instructed the juryat that time and again at the conclusion of trialon the proper use of the conviction as propensity evidence. b. analysis defendant argues that the trial court erred in admitting his 1996 conviction under evidence code section 1108. we review this evidentiary ruling for an abuse of discretion. (people v. powell (2018) 5 cal.5th 921, 961.) although evidence that a criminal defendant has the propensity or disposition to engage in certain conduct is people v. villatoro (2012) 54 cal.4th 1152, 1159; evid. code,  1101, subd. (a)), evidence code section 1108 is an exception to this general rule because it acode,  1108, subd. (a)). before admitting evidence of another sexual offense, however, the trial court must decide under evidence code section 352 whether the probative value of the consumption of in this case, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in conviction under evidence code section 1108 as evidence of 15 defendant(evid. code,  1108, subd. (d)(1)(b).) the trial court also did not abuse its discretion in balancing the pertinent factors under evidence code section 352. the prior conviction was substantially probative of a central issue in this casenamely, whether defendant intended to rape ani b. or instead, as he testified, he just intended to rob her. (see people v. thompson (1980) 27 cal.3d 303, 318 [evidence of uncharged acts must have this probative value was not outweighed by the countervailing considerations. although defendant incurred the conviction in 1996, he was in prison until 2005, on parole until 2008, back in prison until 2010 for failing to register as a sex offender, and on parole again until 2012. consequently, the age of the 1996 conviction does not render it less egregious by virtue oincarcerated years. (people v. daniels (2009) 176 cal.app.4th 304, 317.) nor pertinent conviction documents take up much time, let alone defendant makes three arguments in response. first, he paradoxically asserts that his prior conviction was both although there was other evidenc(such as his web searches on how to get away with rape as well as his reported groping of ani b. and the other victims), his prior conviction of assault with intent to commit rape constituted independent further evidence of that intent and of 16 predisposition. it was certainty prejudicial (because its probative value undermined his defense) but was not unduly prejudicial (because it did not elicit an emotional reaction from the jury (people v. thornton (2007) 41 cal.4th 391, 427)). second, value. but this contention effectively asks us to reweigh the pertinent factors under evidence code section 352, a task we may not undertake when reviewing for an abuse of discretion. (see people v. carmony (2004) 33 cal.4th 367, 378 (carmony).) lastly, defendant asserts that admission of his prior conviction violated due process. where, as here, admission of evidence complies with a rule of evidence affirmed as constitutional by our supreme court, it also complies with due process. (people v. boyette (2002) 29 cal.4th 381, 427-428.) iv. convictions a. pertinent facts just prior to trial and after defendant had relinquished his right to self-representation and requested the assistance of counsel, defendant filed a motion to dismiss the allegations that his 1994 robbery conviction and 1996 assault with intent to rape conviction constitutes strikes law. after defendant was convicted by the jury and admitted the motion to strike at the beginning of defhearing. the court observed that the current charges involved a displayed or 17 them. based on this conduct, the court found that defendant was ly the court further predatory behaviornamely, assault with intent to commit rape and a robbery that occurred in the midst of a carjacking. all in son that the three strikes law was enacted for, to protect society b. analysis defendant argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss. we review such denials for an abuse of discretion. (carmony, supra, 33 cal.4th at pp. 373-374.) a trial court has the discretion to grant a motion to dismiss a strike allegation. ( 1385, subd. (a); people v. williams (1998) 17 cal.4th 148, 161-162.) in deciding whether to exercise that discretion, the coand prior serious and/or violent felony convictions, and the particulars of his background, character and prospects, the defendant may be deemed ouspirit, in whole or in part, and hence should be treated as though he had not previously been convicted of one or more serious carmony, supra, 33 cal.4th at p. 377.) the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the court thoroughly explained why, in its view, defendant was the proverbial poster child for why the three strikes law exists. 18 defendant raises three arguments in response. first, he argues that the court erred by focusing solely on his prior convictions, a factor that cannot by itself defeat a motion to dismiss prior convictions because any such movant by definition has such priors. (accord, people v. bishop (1997) 56 cal.app.4th 1245, 1250-1251.) this argument ignores that the trial court focused chiefly on the nature of the current crimes, their similarity to his prior convictions, and how that similarity bespoke of a person who was a lifelong predator of the type the three strikes law was meant to reach; thus, the court relied on contends his prior convictions are stale. this argument is unconvincing for the reasons explained above. third, defendant asserts that the factors relevant to whether to dismiss a prior conviction balance in his favor, including his age (41 at the time of sentencing). defendant is effectively asking us to reweigh these factors and to come to a different conclusion than the trial court. this we cannot do. (people v. myers (1999) 69 cal.app.4th 305, 309-might disagree about whether to strike one or more of [a v. remand to consider whether to dismiss firearm enhancements in his final argument on appeal, defendant contends that he is entitled to a remand for the trial court to consider whether to strike the 10-year firearm enhancements imposed pursuant to sections 12022.53 and 12022.5 because our legislature in january 2018 for the first time granted trial courts the discretion to dismiss those enhancements. ( 12022.53. subd. (h), 12022.5, subd. (c).) defendant is correct that the statutory amendments conferring this discretion apply retroactively to him because his 19 convictions are not yet final. (e.g., people v. chavez (2018) 22 cal.app.5th 663, 712.) however, it is well settled that a remand for a trial court to exercise that discretion is not necessary where en aware that it id. at p. 713, quoting people v. gutierrez (2014) 58 cal.4th 1354, 1391; people v. mcdaniels (2018) 22 cal.app.5th 420, 425; people v. mcvey (2018) 24 cal.app.5th 405, 418-419.) the trial court gave just such a clear indication in this . . . to the maximum . . . he did 15 searches on how to get away with rape . . . this makes him just supremely dangerous besides petition for writ of habeas corpus in his separately filed petition for a writ of habeas corpus, defendant argues that his trial counsel was constitutionally suppress during the trial, (2) did not give an opening statement court that competent could have testified as to relevant evidence that was exculpatory and could have aff fell below an objective standard of reasonableness . . . under prevailing professional norms.; and 20 probability . . . the outcome of the proceeding would have been people v. mickel (2016) 2 cal.5th 181, 198, citing strickland v. washington (1984) 466 u.s. 688, 687-people v. washington (2017) 15 cal.app.5th 19, 25.) defendant has not established that his trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective. trial counsel was not ineffective for suppress because renewals are statutorily barred unless there is some previously unavailable ground on which to do so ( 1538.5, subd. (h)), and defendant has neither alleged nor established as much. absent that showing, any renewed motion would have been meritless, and aconstitute ineffectiveness. (people v. lucero (2000) 23 cal.4th 692, 732.) trial counsel was also not ineffective in deciding to e decision whether to reserve opening statement is a matter of trial tactics and strategy that a reviewing court generally cannot second people v. davenport (1995) 11 cal.4th 1171, 1237, abrogated on other grounds in people v. griffin, (2004) 33 cal.4th 536, 555, fn. 5) (defendant is incorrect to the extent he suggests defense counsel gave no opening statement at all.) and and lack any factual basis. as our supreme court has said time allegations do not warrant [habeas] relief.in re reno (2012) 55 cal.4th 428, 493.) 21 disposition the judgment is affirmed, and the petition for writ of habeas corpus is denied. not to be published in the official reports. ______________________, j. hoffstadt we concur: _________________________, p. j. lui _________________________, j. chavez
