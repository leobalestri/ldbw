(pen. code,  597, subd. (a), 12022, subd. (b)(1).) it was alleged he had eight prior and four prior prison terms. (pen. code,  667, subds. (a)(1), (b)-(i), 667.5, subd. (b), 1170.12, subd. (a), 1203, subd. (e)(4).) during pretrial proceedings, a doubt was declared as to 1368. he was eventually found competent. on december 6, 2011, he pled no contest to all four counts, and admitted the personal weapon use, a second strike, and the 13 years in prison. among other fines and fees, he was assessed a $200 restitution fine pursuant to penal code section 1202.4, subdivision (b). more than four years later, appellant filed a motion for reconsideration of his restitution fine.1 the court denied the motion, ruling: 1 the superior court file and was unable to 3 lengthy term in state prison and a $2,000 [sic$200] restitution fine was imposed. no objection to the fine was made. s filed a so-called motion c[es] and any obligations to suggestion for relief. indeed, it is a frivolous request.  13967, subd.

(people v. frye (1994) 21 cal.app.4th 1483[.]) frye held that after defendant pleaded guilty to possession of methamphetamine in state prison (pen. code,  4573.6), the trial court did not err in imposing a restitution fine of $ 200, even though defendant indicated that he did not have the ability to pay it, since, in the absence of any evidence that defendant was ineligible for prison work assignment, the court could presume the fine would be paid out of sis of gov. code,  13967, subd. (a) (upon conviction of felony, court must impose restitution fine of not less than $ and pen. code,  1202.4, subd. (a) (upon conviction of felony, court must impose restitution fine as provided in gov. code,  pay), leads to the conclusion that the trial court must consider a restitution fine, but the court is not limited to a consideration of 4 his or her future financial prospects. appellant appealed the denial of his motion to reconsider the restitution fine. discussion we appointed counsel to represent appellant on this appeal. -appointed counsel filed an opening brief asking this court to review the record independently pursuant to wende, supra, 25 cal.3d at page 441. on april 13, 2017, we advised appellant he had 30 days to submit any contentions or issues he wished us to consider. appellant did not file a supplemental brief. we have examined the entire record. we are satisfied no l has fully satisfied his responsibilities under wende.
