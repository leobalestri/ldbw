(a), (b)). the jury was unable to reach a verdict on the count involving the november 20 offense but convicted dorman on the second count related to the november 21st attack. the jury also found true the special allegations that dorman had suffered two prior strike convictions for burglary ( 459). dorman was sentenced under the three strikes law to an indeterminate state prison term of 25 years to life. 4 3. on november 27, 2012 dorman filed a petition for recall of his sentence and resentencing under proposition 36, which amended the three strikes sentencing scheme to provide, in general, that a recidivist is not subject to an indeterminate life term for a third strike felony that is neither serious nor violent, unless the offense satisfies other criteria identified in the statutes. ( 667, subd. (e)(2)(c), 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(c); see people v. frierson (2017) 4 cal.5th 225, 229 (frierson).) it also permitted some inmates serving a three strikes sentence to petition for the recall and modification of their current sentence on the ground they would not have been subject to an indeterminate life sentence had proposition 36 been in effect at the time of their sentencing. ( 1170.126, subd. (b).) dorman argued in his petition he was eligible for recall of his sentence because his third strike conviction for inflicting corporal injury on a cohabitant was not a serious or violent felony within the meaning of the three strikes law and neither of his prior strike convictions disqualified him. the superior court issued an order to show cause why the petition should not be granted. the people opposed the petition, asserting dorman was ineligible for resentencing under section 1170.126, subdivision (e)(2), because,current offense, the defendant . . . intended to cause great bodily subd. (c)(2)(c)(iii).) the people also argued dorman was unsuitable for resentencing. following a hearing on october 2, 2017, the superior court found by a preponderance of the evidence that dorman was ineligible for resentencing because he had intended to cause great 5 bodily injury to kimberly when he struck her on november 21, 1994. discussion 1. governing law vioconvicted of non-violent, non-serious crimes like shoplifting and simple drug possession [to] receive twice the normal sentence (nov. 6, 2012) text of prop. 36,  6.) as part of its goal of limiting indeterminate life sentences to serious or violent felony offenders, proposition 36 added section 1170.126, which permits inmates previously sentenced to life terms under an earlier version of the three strikes law to petition to recall their sentences and, if eligible for relief, to be resentenced to the term that would have been imposed for their crime under the new sentencing provisions. ( 1170.126, subd. (a).) even if the petitioner is otherwise entitled to be resentenced under the new three strikes discretion, determines that resentencing the petitioner would ( 1170.126, subd. (f).) an inmate is eligible for resentencing if his or her current sentence was not imposed for a violent or serious felony and was not imposed for any of the offenses described in clauses (i) to (iv) of section 1170.12, subdivision (c)(2)(c), or clauses (i) to (iv) of section 667, subdivision (e)(2)(c). ( 1170.126, subd. (e); see also people v. estrada (2017) 3 cal.5th 661, 667.) those clauses 6 describe certain kinds of criminal conduct, including offenses . intended to cause great (e)(2)(c)(iii), 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(c)(iii).) 2. the superior court employed the incorrect standard of proof the resentencing provision of proposition 36 does not expressly identify the standard of proof to be applied to the hearing on dormancourts of appeal that had addressed the issue had held the correct standard of proof was preponderance of the evidence. applying that standard the superior court found dorman had committed the underlying act of domestic violence with the intent to cause great bodily injury to kimberly, thus making him ineligible for resentencing under proposition 36. approximately osupreme court decided frierson, supra, 4 cal.5th 225, which held the people must establish ineligibility for resentencing beyond a reasonable doubt. (id. at p. 240; accord, people v. perez (2018) 4 to find a defendant . . . ineligible for resentencing only if the prosecutor proves [the] basis for ineligibility beyond a reasonable 3. harmless the supreme courts holding in frierson that the proper standard of proof is beyond a reasonable doubt was based on an interpretation of state law. (frierson, supra, 4 cal.5th at pp. 235-239.) accordingly, the superior error in applying a preponderance-of-the-evidence standard is evaluated under the 7 harmless error standard articulated in people v. watson (1956) 46 cal.2d 818, 836, which requires the defendant to show it is reasonably probable a more favorable result would have been reached in the absence of the error. (see people v. gonzalez (2018) 5 cal.5th 186, 201; people v. mendoza (2016) 62 cal.4th 856, 902.) dorman did not carry his burden of showing there is a reasonable probability the superior court would have granted his petition under proposition 36 if the court had applied a beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard. a. ( 12022.7, subd. (f); see cgreat bodily injury means significant or substantial physical injury. it is an injury that is greater than ) to rise to the level of great bodily injury, permanent, prolonged or protracted disfigurement, impairment, or loss of bodily (people v. escobar (1992) 3 cal.4th 740, 750.) lacerations, bruises and abrasions are sufficient to sustain a finding of great bodily injury. (people v. odom (2016) 244 cal.app.4th 237, 247; people v. washington (2012) 210 cal.app.4th 1042, 1047.) similarly, a bone fracture, even a facial fracture where no surgery is required, can constitute great bodily injury. (people v. nava (1989) 207 cal.app.3d 1490, 1499; see people v. villarreal (1985) 173 cal.app.3d 1136, 1140-1141 [evidence of a bone fracture supports a true finding on the great bodily injury enhancement and in some circumstances significant or substantial injurylaw].) and an injury caused by hands or fists alone may be 8 sufficient to constitute great bodily injury. (see people v. aguilar (1997) 16 cal.4th 1023, 1037-1038 [an assault by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury may be committed with the hand or fists]; people v. davis (1996) 42 cal.app.4th 806, 818 [many decisions hold that hands or fists may be used with sufficient force to create great bodily injury].) b. it is not reasonably probable dorman would have achieved a more favorable result if the proper standard had been applied in its memorandum of decision the superior court her cheekbone was fractured in two places; she had a broken tooth; and there was swelling and bruising on her face. the court also noted resulting pain, especially when biting, frequent nose bleeds and her need for medical attention to control the pain. based on this evidence, the court found dorman had intended to cause great bodily injury, properly using the presumption that where one applies force to another in a manner reasonably certain to produce, and actually producing, great bodily injury, the requisite intent can be presumed, since the intent with which an act is done may be inferred from the circumstances attending the act . . . (people v. phillips (1989) 208 cal.app.3d 1120, 1124; accord, people v. harvey (1992) 7 cal.app.4th 823, 826.) although acknowledging that dorman had thrown only one punch, the court noted that the radiologist had opinrequired to produce the facial fractures. (see in re nirran w. (1989) 207 cal.app.3d 1157, 1162 [affirming the finding an assault had been committed by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury where a single blow, delivered without warning , was sufficient to knock her down and pop her jaw out and then back 9 in].) in addition, the court threats of physical harm to kimberly, his destructive actions in their apartment on the day of the assault and his three-month history of abuse against the victim as further circumstantial evidence of his intent to cause her great bodily harm. (see people v. guilford (2014) 228 cal.app.4th 651, 661-662 [trial court could reasonably find defendant intended to inflict great bodily injury during current offense based on evidence he had physically abused his spouse in the past].) the evidence in the record, described in full and accurate detail by the superior court, establishes beyond a reasonable doubt that dorman inflicted great bodily injury on kimberly and the incorrect standard of proof was harmless. disposition the order is affirmed. perluss, p. j. we concur: zelon, j. segal, j.
