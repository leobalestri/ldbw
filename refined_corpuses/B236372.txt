(b)(1)). the trial court, on september 26, 2011, sentenced patricia to 15 years to life plus one year for the weapon enhancement, for a total of 16 years to life. discussion i. exclusion of evidence. patricia contends that the trial court violated her federal due process rights to a fair trial and to present a defense under the fifth and sixth amendments by excluding evidence of (a) aggression, (b) martinez that she had been hit, and (c) that junior was a gang member. we find that the abuse of discretion standard of revieadmissibility of evidence. (people v. rowland (1992) 4 cal.4th 238, 264.) under this required, unless the trial court exercised its discretion in an arbitrary, capricious, or patently absurd manner that resulted in a manifest miscarriage of justice. (people v. rodriguez (1999) 20 cal.4th 1, 9-10.) even erroneous evidentiary rulings usually do not ue process rights. (montana v. egelhoff (1996) 518 u.s. 37, 52-53 [such due process claims, usually citing chambers v. mississippi (1973) 410 u.s. 284, are often overbroad, as chambers was a fact intensive, specific case]; people v. falsetta (1999) 21 cal.4th 903, 913; people v. partida (2005) 37 cal.4th 428, 433-438; people v. tafoya (2007) 42 cal.4th 147, 165, fn. 5.) 5 all further undesignated statutory references are to the penal code. 5 a. prior threats and acts of aggression. patricia first argues that the trial court improperly excluded evidence that junior had threatened her in the past. because evidence of his past threats was admitted, we the decisive factor in determining what crimefirst or second degree murder or voluntary manslaughterat the time of the homicide. (people v. danielly (1949) 33 cal.2d 362, 385.) where self-defense or mind.6 self-defense, for example, has two components, an actual subjective belief and objective reasonableness. (people v. humphrey objective component is not measured by an abstract standard of reasonableness but one th. because his state of mind is a critical issue, he may explain his actions in light of his knowledge concerning ] relevant to interpreting the id. at p. 1094; see also people v. minifie (1996) 13 cal.4th 1055 [trial court improperly excluded threats made to defendant by third parties close to the victim; such threats were relevant to self-defense, but their exclusion was harmless error].) voluntary manslaughter theory, the trial court did not issue an order excluding all such threats. at a pretrial hearing, d patricia] previously told [martinez] about the family 6 of course, self-defense was not at issue here, because the trial court refused to instruct on it, an issue we discuss below. 6 tatements to martinez state of mind and were admissible under evidence code section 1103. the trial court ruled that martinez could testify about what she overheard on her phone call with patricia martinez, because the court wanted to see what the testimony would be. it does not appear that this issue was directly discussed again. defense counsel, however, also alluded to threats of violence junior made three to inappropriate. thereafter, at trial, martinez testified that one month before patricia stabbed junior, he threatened to kill both patricia and martinez. on the morning patricia stabbed junior, martinez, who was on the phone with patricia, heard junior in the background therefore, the record shows that prior threats were introduced at trial. the only prior threat the trial court expressly excluded was one that occurred three months before patricia stabbed junior. it is unclear, however, what was the exact threat made. patricia also does not make clear what other specific threats were excluded. given that the precise nature of any excluded threats is not before us, we cannot see how patricia was prejudiced by their exclusion. this is especially true since other evidence was admitted that patricia and junior had a tumultuous relationship and that he had threatened her prior to the incident. this other evidence in 7 was allowed to testify not only about threats junior made the day of the incident but also about past threats. moreover, the trial court said it would consider prior threats junior made to martinez, but it does not appear that defense counsel obtained further clarification or a ruling.7 trial evidence would show, will not preserve the issue for appeal if the appellant could have, but did not, renew the objection or offer of proof and press for a final ruling in the people v. holloway (2004) 33 cal.4th 96, 133.) where a trial court reserves its decision, the party desiring to introduce the evidence must renew the motion or remind the court that a ruling is desired. (ibid.) ts were abused its discretion by excluding the threat junior made three months before, there was ntrary, evidence of his prior threats was admitted, and it was clear that junior and patricia had a rocky, sometimes violent, relationship. b. the text message. on the morning junior was stabbed, patricia sent a text message at 11:59 a.m. to martinez stating she had been hit. two minutes later, anna called 911 to report that her brother had been stabbed. the trial court excluded the text message, finding it did not go under evidence code section 1250, an out-of-court statement to prove the 7 record is not clear what was the specific threat or threats the trial court excluded, we do -of-mind exception to the hearsay rule, an exception we discuss infra. 8 acts or conduct.8 (see generally, people v. riccardi (2012) 54 cal.4th 758, 814, 820 before the crime and may have been motivated by it]; people v. kovacich (2011) 201 conduct must be placed in issue].) here, by virtue of at least the sudden quarrel/heat of passion theory, patricimental state was at issue. her text message could explain why she stabbed junior minutes after sending it; namely, he hit her and, in a fit of passion, she stabbed him. -of-court statement that she had been hit showed her mental state and her conduct in conformity with it. (see people riccardi, supra, 54 cal.4th at pp. 818-819 conformity with it]; people v. kovacich, supra, 201 cal.app.4th at pp. 888-889 statements were admissible under state of mind exception because her mental state was placed in issue].)9 even if it was error to exclude the text message, patricia suffered no prejudice from the error. there was ample other evidence of patriciano dispute, for example, that junior hit patricia before she stabbed him. both anna and jose testified that junior hit patricia. patricia called 911 to report that her brother had hit 8 or physical sensation (including a statement of intent, plan, motive, design, mental feeling, pain, or bodily health) is not made inadmissible by the hearsay rule when: [] (1) the evidence is offered to prove tsensation at that time or at any other time when it is itself an issue in the action; or [] (2) code,  1250, subd. (a).) 9 riccardi concerned statements made by the deceased victim expressing her fear of and used his knowledge to ambush and to kill the victim, the declarant-s statements were admissible under evidence code section 1250. of course, this case is factually different because the defendant, patricia, sought to use her own statement to show her fear or passion and her conduct in conformity with her fear or passion. 9 her. patricia also had bruising under her eye and on her arm. the text message was merely additional evidence that junior hit patricia before she stabbed him. c. evidence junior was a gang member. the defense asked to admit evidence junior was a gang member, including gang affiliation. noting it was not necessarily true that people are more afraid of threats from a gang member where, as here, the gang-brother, the trial court excluded the evidence as irrelevant and under evidence code gang or not, what the tattoos mean. but really what the most important thing is whether a means evidence, including evidence relevant to the credibility of a witness or hearsay declarant, having any tendency in reason to prove or disprove any disputed fact that is of people v. lee (2011) 51 cal.4th 620, 642; people v. mills (2010) 48 cal.4th 158, 193; people v. williams (2008) 43 cal.4th 584, 633-634.) relevant evidence, however, may be by the probability that its admission will (a) necessitate undue consumption of time or (b) create substantial danger of undue prejudice, of confusing the issues, or of misleading the jury. (evid. code,  352; lee, at p. 643.) a trial court has broad discretion in determining whether evidence is relevant and whether evidence code section 352 precludes its admission. (mills, at p. 195; williams, at p. 634; people v. brown (2003) 31 cal.4th 518, 547.) as we have said, the abuse of discretion standard applies to a trial or probative value of the evidence in question. (lee, at p. 643.) 10 the case other than character evidence, is not more prejudicial than probative, and is not people v. avitia (2005) 127 cal.app.4th 185, 192.) even where relevant, gang evidence should be carefully scrutinized before it is admitted because it may have a highly inflammatory impact on the jury.10 (id. at pp. 192-193.) we cannot conclude, under evidence code section 352, that the trial court abused its discretion by excluding to a gang. rather, according to defemembers; hence, the trial court ordered martinez also, the trial court observed that while the general public might be afraid of gang patricia, who was his sister and lived with him. there simply was no evidence of a connection bepeople v. cash (2002) 28 cal.4th 703, 726-violent acts].) given the familial connection and the lack of evidence that patricia was specifically afraid of junior because he was a gang member, we cannot say the court on patricia was speculative and prejudicial when weighed against its low probative value. 10 of course, in most cases, the gang evidence concerns the defendant and not the victim, as is the case here. 11 ii. self-defense. and imperfect self-defense deprived her of rights guaranteed under the united states disagree. a trial court must instruct the jury, sua sponte, on the general principles of law that are closely and openly connected to the facts and understanding of the case. (people v. moye (2009) 47 cal.4th 537, 548; people v. abilez (2007) 41 cal.4th 472, 517; people v. breverman (1998) 19 cal.4th 142, 154.) instructions on a lesser included offense must be given when there is substantial evidence from which the jury could conclude the defendant is guilty of the lesser offense, but not the charged offense. (people v. manriquez (2005) 37 cal.4th 547, 584; people v. cook (2006) 39 cal.4th 566, 596.) substantial evidence is evidence that a reasonable jury could find persuasive. (manriquez, at p. 584.) in deciding whether there is substantial evidence of a lesser included offense, we do not evaluate the credibility of the witnesses, a task for the trier of fact. (id. at p. 585.) we independently review whether the trial court erred by failing to instruct on a lesser included offense. (ibid.; people v. oropeza (2007) 151 cal.app.4th 73, 78.) the trial court instructed on first and second degree murder and on voluntary manslaughter under a heat of passion theory. the trial court did not instruct on either voluntary manslaughter under an imperfect self-defense theory or on perfect self-defense. voluntary manslaughter, a lesser included offense of murder, is the intentional but nonmalicious killing of a human being. ( 192, subd. (a); people v. moye, supra, 47 cal.4th at p. 549; people v. lee (1999) 20 cal.4th 47, 59; people v. manriquez, supra, 37 cal.4th at p. 583.) under imperfect self-defense, a killing may be reduced from murder to voluntary manslaughter where the defendant kills another human being under the actual but unreasonable belief that the killer was in imminent danger of death or great bodily injury. (in re christian s. (1994) 7 cal.4th 768, 771, 773; people v. manriquez, at p. 583; people v. lasko (2000) 23 cal.4th 101, 108-110; people v. cruz (2008) 44 12 cal.4th 636, 664.) imperfect self--defense in that the latter requires an actual and reasonable belief in the npeople v. humphrey, supra, - defendant must actually and reasonably believe in the need to defend. . . . to constitute -e person completely, the belief must also be objectively reasonable. [citations.] . . . ibid.) for both perfect and imperfect self-defense, the fear must be of imminent harm. (people v. humphrey, supra, no matter how great the fear and no matter how great the likelihood of the harmwill not suffice. imminent danger ibid.; see also people v. butler (2009) 46 cal.4th 847, 868.) the defendant instantly dealt with people v. rogers (2006) 39 cal.4th 826, 883, italics omitted.) people v. lopez (2011) 199 cal.app.4th 1297, 1305; see also in re christian s., supra, 7 cal.4th at p. 783.) all the relevant circumstances in which the defendant found herself may be considered in determining whether the accused perceived an imminent threat of death or great bodily injury. (humphrey, at p. 1083.) there was insufficient evidence patricia feared imminent harm. true, junior hit patricia and they across the floor to her. but there is no evidence he wielded the knife against her in a threatening manner at any time. jose separated them, and junior left the room. then, when patricia saw junior throwing her clothes into a basket, they argued again, with patricia repeating her threats to kill junior. junior did not, however, hit patricia again, move towards her or verbally threaten to kill her. he was also unarmed. although junior made no threatening gesture, patricia went to the kitchen drawer, opened it, and removed a knife. she walked to junior and swung at him twice with the knife, stabbing him the 13 second time in the chest. although this evidence could show a heat of passion, it does nor do we think that the excluded evidence, discussed above in part i of the nt harm. it therefore would not have helped patricia prove that element had martinez been patricia had a turbulent relationship and that he had hit her in the past and threatened her. additional evidence of such past threats would not have demonstrated an imminent threat to patricia. iii. prosecutorial misconduct. patricia contends that the prosecutor committed prejudicial misconduct by vouching for her witnesses, appthe law. we find that no prejudicial misconduct occurred. a. applicable law. . . . intemperate behavior violates the federal conduct by a prosecutor that does not render a criminal trial fundamentally unfair is (people v. samayoa (1997) 15 cal.4th 795, 841.) misconduct that infringes upon a (chapman v. california (1967) 386 u.s. 18.) a violation of state law only is cause for reversal when it is reasonably probable that a result more favorable to the defendant 14 would have occurred had the district attorney refrained from the untoward comment. (people v. watson (1956) 46 cal.2d 818.) comments by prosecutors are generally treated by juries as words of an advocate in an attempt to persuade. (see people v. clair (1992) 2 cal.4th 629, 663, fn. 8.) the prosecution is given wide latitude during closing argument to make fair comment on the evidence, including reasonable inferences or deductions to be drawn from it. (people v. collins (2010) 49 cal.4th 175, 213.) when a claim of misconduct focuses on comments the prosecutor made before the jury, the question is whether there is a reasonable likelihood the jury construed or applied any of the complained-of remarks in an objectionable fashion. (people v. samayoa, supra, 15 cal.4th at p. 841.) we must place the challenged statement in context and view the argument as a whole. (people v. cole (2004) 33 cal.4th 1158, 1203.) timely objection and, unless an admonition would not have cured the harm, ask the trial court to admonish t(people v. martinez (2010) 47 cal.4th 911, 955-956.) b. vouching for witnesses. patricia contends that the prosecutor improperly vouched for their credibility. we disagree. a prosecutor may not express a personal opinion or belief in the guilt of the accused, or vouch for the credibility of a witness, when there is a substantial danger that the jury will view the comments as based on information other than evidence adduced at than its own view of the evidence. (united states v. young (1985) 470 u.s. 1, 18-19; people v. lopez (2008) 42 cal.4th 960, 971; people v. mayfield (1997) 14 cal.4th 668, 781-782; people v. martinez, supra, 47 cal.4th at p. 958.) although it is improper to bolster a witness by referring to facts outside the record (people v. huggins (2006) 38 cal.4th 175, 206-207; people v. williams (1997) 16 cal.4th 153, 257), a prosecutor is 15 free to give an opinion on the state of the evidence and has wide latitude to comment on its quality and the credibility of witnesses (people v. padilla (1995) 11 cal.4th 891, 945-946, disapproved on other grounds in people v. hill (1998) 17 cal.4th 800, 823, fn. 1; martinez, at p. 958 [prosecutor may comment on the credibility of witnesses based on facts contained in the record and on any reasonable inferences that can be drawn from them]; mayfield, the prosecutor makes clear the belief is based on the evidence]). it is not misconduct for s as drawn from huggins ce and the inferences that may be drawn from it. (see people v. cummings (1993) 4 cal.4th 1233, 1303, fn. 48; people v. frye (1998) 18 cal.4th 894, 1018-1019, disapproved on other grounds in people v. doolin (2009) 45 cal.4th 390, 421, fn. 22; u.s. v. bentley (8th cir. 2009) 561 f.3d 803, 812.) facts. both of them agree that there were many minutes between when junior initially confronted the defendant about decking his little sister. and when the defendant ultimately took it upon herself to cross that kitchen, open that drawer, select the right tool for the task, she had in mind and carried out her vicious plan. [] they both also agree that between the time junior initially confronted the defendant and the time she stabbed him, he never physically approached her again. he never verbally threatened her in that altercation. and they both agree that she was unarmed with his hand at his side at the time that steel was cutting through his flesh. [] honest about her part in screaming and calling names. they were honest that there was cussing and cursing going on. they were honest that there had been arguments in the past between junior and the defendant. 16 anna even saidto tell the truth, and they did. and that truth is corroborated by all of the other evidence the argument on evidence. (see people v. cummings, supra, 4 cal.4th at p. 1303, fn. 48; people v. frye, supra, 18 cal.4th at pp. 1018-1019.) both anna and jose, for example, said that junior and patricia were cursing and had argued in the past; hence, anna and or junior did. the prosecutor did not imply she had extraneous information not presented to the jury. because the argument was based on the evidence, it did not amount to improper vouching for a witness. c. . nexby a cts and the law in this case. [] the defendant murdered her brother in front of her siblings in a willful and a deliberate and a premeditated way. [] for you to find otherwise and where anybody can set up their own standard of what they want to do at any given time. [] no one wants to live in that kind of world. in fact, the laws of our state are designed to prevent us from descending to doing that it is misconduct for a prosecutor to make comments that are calculated to arouse passion or prejudice. (people v. mayfield, supra, improper to make arguments to the jury that give 17 people v. redd (2010) 48 cal.4th 691, 742.) it is, for example, victim experienced. (people v. vance (2010) 188 cal.app.4th 1182, 1192.) it is also misconduct to ask the jurid. at p. 1193.) increasing menace of criminal conduct and the necessity of a strong sense of duty on the part of jurors.people v. adanandus (2007) 157 cal.app.4th 496, 513; cf. united states v. monaghan (d.c.cir. 1984) 741 f.2d 1434, 1441-1442 [a prosecutor may not suggest that the defendant be convicted to protect community values, preserve civic order or to deter future lawbreaking in an attempt to excite prejudice or passion].) a adanandus, at pp. 511-513.) such comments were an exhortation to the jury to take its duty seriously. (id. at p. 513; see also people v. wash (1993) 6 cal.4th 215, 261-262 [no prejudicial misconduct occurred restore confidence in the criminal justice system].) the comments the prosecutor here made similarly were an appeal to the jury to take its duty seriously, to maintain law and order. the prosecutor argued there was no evidence patricia acted under a sudden heat of passion and then suggested that the jurors would not want to live in a world where the facts gave rise merely to voluntary manslaughter rather than premeditated murder. this argument related the facts of the case to the law. it was a permissible exhortation to the jury to follow the law. d. misstating the law. people v. bell (1989) 49 cal.3d 502, 538.) patricia argues that the prosecutor, in closing argument, misstated the law as to the provocation sufficient to negate malice. 18 the provocation that incites the defendant to homicidal conduct must be caused by the victim or be conduct reasonably believed by the defendant to have been engaged in by the victim. (people v. manriquez, supra, 37 cal.4th at p. 583.) it may be physical or verbal, but it must be sufficiently provocative to cause an ordinary person of average disposition to act rashly or without due deliberation and reflection. (ibid.; people v. lee, supra, 20 cal.4th at p. 59.) patricia argues that the prosecutor misstated this law when she argued to the jury: whto think that this was how anyone would have acted in the situation. [] first off, she had a myriad of other options. she could have left, could have not be comfortable with it [junior hitting patricia]. it may not be what you would have done, but it does not rise to that kind of provocation where anyone would have taken thattaken that punch to the face and said, done it. [] of an average disposition would react to that type of situation.added.) average person would have been forced into a positiodisposition would act this way. andand that is the standard, the average disp patricia analogizes these comments to ones the prosecutor made in people v. najera (2006) 138 cal.app.4th 212, 223. najera found that the prosecutor misstated the law on heat of passion when he told the jury that whether the defendant acted under a which the defendant was placed. (ibid.) the prosecutor, for example, repeatedly asked 19 what a reasonable person would do in similar circumstances. najera noted that the focus of a heat of passion theory is on provocationwhether the surrounding circumstances were sufficient to cause a reasonable person to act rashly. (ibid.) the reasonableness of ibid.)11 comments here are different. the prosecutor focused on if inartful, did not remove the focus from provocation and instead place it on the reasonableness of the law, the jury was instructed on, among others, voluntary manslaughter, heat of passion and that the jury must follow the instructions even if an attconflict with them. (caljic no. 570.) also, placed in the whole context of the argument, we cannot find that these comments prejudiced patricia to the extent that a more favorable outcome would have resulted. (cf. people v. hill (1998) 17 cal.4th 800, 819-- e. ineffective assistance of counsel. id not object to any of these instances of alleged prosecutorial misconduct. she therefore contends that her counsel rendered ineffective assistance. because we have concluded either that no misconduct occurred or that prejudice did not result from any pwhether to object or to seek a jury admonition is a strategic one, and the failure to do 11 the proper instruction on provocation and heat of passion and related prosecutorial misconduct are currently on review in the supreme court in people v. beltran (apr. 25, 2012, s192644) __ cal.4th __ [2012 cal. lexis 3937]. 20 either seldom establishes constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel. (see, e.g., people v. castaneda (2011) 51 cal.4th 1292, 1335; people v. collins (2010) 49 cal.4th comments made by the prshould be reluctant to second-guess defense counsel. (people v. padilla, supra, 11 cal.4th at p. 942, overruled on other grounds by people v. hill, supra, 17 cal.4th at p. 823, fn. failed to act in the instance asserted to be ineffective, unless counsel was asked for an explanation and failed to provide one, or unless there simply could be no satisfactory explanation, people v. huggins, supra, 38 cal.4th at p. 206.) there are several reasons why defense counsel may not have objected to the attention to isolated comments, and she believed that the jury instructions would be adequate to address any misstatement. we therefore cannot conclude that defense counsel rendered ineffective assistance. iv. cumulative error. to the extent patricia contends that the cumulative effect of the purported errors reach the same conclusion with respect to the cumulative effect of any purported errors. (people v. cole (2004) 33 cal.4th 1158, 1235-1236; people v. butler (2009) 46 cal.4th 847, 885.) 21 disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports aldrich, j. we concur: klein, p. j. croskey, j.
