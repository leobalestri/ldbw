(ellis v. ellis (2015) 235 cal.app.4th 837, 846; norman i. krug real estate investments, inc. v. praszker (1990) 220 cal.app.3d 35, 46.) in addition, even had defendant appealed those judgments, the appeal would have been untimely. (cal. rules of court, rule 8.104; hollister convalescent hosp., inc. v. rico (1975) 15 cal.3d 660, 666-667.) we therefore 1 all statutory citations are to the penal code unless otherwise noted. 2 (people v. rivera (2015) 233 cal.app.4th 1085, 1089.) 3 we have made an independent examination of the entire record to determine if there are any other arguable issues on appeal. based on that review, we have determined there are no other arguable issues. we are therefore satisfied that defendants counsel has fully complied with his responsibilities under wende, supra, 25 cal.3d 436. disposition the order is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports kumar, j. we concur: kriegler, acting p. j. baker, j. judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
