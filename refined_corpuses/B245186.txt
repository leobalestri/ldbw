(villarroel had made the domestic violence allegations.) when the officers arrived, villarroel told them aguiar was not at home. the officers, who did not have a warrant to search the home, asked permitted the officers to enter the house and the backyard for that limited purpose. once in the backyard, the officers observed in plain view numerous marijuana plants and instruments used for cultivating marijuana. villarroel was arrested. officer karel castro, called to the scene to assist the officers in spanish translation because villarroel is a native spanish speaker, testified villarroel was sitting at the kitchen table when he arrived at the house. she was not handcuffed and had not been purse containing the cell phone had been on the table next to villarroel when he arrived, but he could not recall that fact specifically.1 -year-old son, paul aguiar, who was sitting at the table next to his mother, to retrieve her purse so she could provide castro with her identification. after villarroel was handcuffed, arrested and placed in a police car, castro conducted an inventory search of the purse and found the cell phone. 1 able when he arrived. the prosecutor did not indicate when castro had testified to that effect previously, and there is no prior testimony in the record provided in connection with the writ petition. castro explained he thought the purse had been on the been on the table. on cross- 4 paul aguiar testified, after his mother was placed in the police car, a police officer acknowledged he did not actually see the officer go to the bedroom, but he later saw one next to his mother at the kitchen table the entire time castro was in the house and the purse had not been on the table. villarroel testified her purse had been hanging in her bedroom closet when she was arrested. she did not ask anyone to retrieve it. she later saw an officer holding her cell phone. villarroel never consented to the search of her purse or her cell phone. 3. expectation of privacy in her purse and its contents and the people had failed to satisfy their burden to demonstrate the warrantless search of those items was justified as a search incident to an arrest. specifically, the court found the people had not established the purse was next to villarroel on the table or otherwise within her immediate control when it was searched. (see chimel v. california (1969) 395 u.s. 752, 762-763 [89 s.ct. 2034, 23 l.ed.2d 685] [search incident to arrest is an exception to the warrant requirement; police may search persremove weapons and secure evidence]; people v. schmitz (2012) 55 cal.4th 909, 927.) 2 to assert a fourth amendment violation, that is, he had no reasonable expectation of people v. ayala (2000) 23 cal.4th 225, 254, fn. h amendment analyses [citation] . . . without altering the nature of 2 . . . i have to suppress the e 5 the inquiry: whether the defendant, rather than someone else, had a reasonable decide whether the purse was discovered during an unlawful search of the home, finding that question immaterial to its standing analysis.3 discussion 1. standard of review in reviewing the ruling on a motion to suppress, the appellate court defers to the actual findings, express or implied, when supported by substantial evidence.

(james, at p. 107.) however, in determining whether, on the facts found, the search or seizure was reasonable under the fourth amendment, we exercise our independent judgment. (redd, at p. 719; people v. glaser (1995) 11 cal.4th 354, 362.) 3 in colloquy with defense counsel the court insisted, if aguiar did not contend he owned the purse or the cell phone itself, he had no protected privacy interest supporting a ha[s] standing in order to be here at this motion. at. owns the house. 6 2. governing law the fourth amendment to the united states constitution protects individuals against unreasonable searches and seizures in those areas in which a person has a reasonable expectation of privacy.

(see alderman v. united states, supra, 394 u.s. at p. 177; mancusi v. deforte (1968) 392 5 provision, cal. const. art. i,  28), state and federal claims relating to exclusion of evidence on grounds of unreasonable search and seizure are measured by the same standard under the federal constitution.

(see people v. redd, supra, 48 cal.4th at p. 719; in re marriage of arceneaux 6 the people did not argue at the suppression hearing, and do not argue on appeal, her bedroom closet. (see schneckloth v. bustamonte, supra, 412 u.s. at p. 219 [consent people v. cantor legally exceed the scope o 9 (1990) 51 cal.3d 1130, 1133.) we do not infer findings to reverse an order unless the record permits no other inference. here, the record does not compel the inference aguiar . . inferred from this record is, wherever it was, the purse was not within villarroelincident to her arrest (see chimel v. california, supra, 395 u.s. at pp. 762-763). een in plain view of the officers who had a legitimate right to be in the home. a search and seizure of the closed purse under those circumstances would have certainly violated as to her. (see people v. shepherd (1994) 23 cal.app.4th 825, 828 [defendant has reasonable expectation of privacy in contents of her own purse when purse is in her possession or control or in her own home and not left or abandoned in public place]; united states v. davis however, a search of the purse under those circumstances would not have violated any fourth amendment right odiscovered during an unlawful search of his home.

(see people v. thompson (2010) 49 cal.4th 79, 110, fn. 13 [argument not made in briefs cannot be 11 people v. koury, supra, 214 cal.app.3d 676, on which aguiar relies, is not to the search warrant and, during the search, found a zippered pouch, a locked briefcase and two closed suitcases, all containing cocaine. the pouch, briefcase and one of the suitcases belonged to hernandez, a house guest. hernandez moved to suppress the evidence on the ground it was discovered without a warrant authorizing the search of his items. koury moved to suppress the evidence on the ground the affidavit used to support the warrant to search his home was legally inadequate and contained misrepresentations and omissions. koury and hernandez also filsuppress. (id. at pp. 681-682) the people asserted neither koury nor hernandez lived at the home and thus lacked standing to assert a fourth amendment violation. the trial court agreed and denied their motions to suppress. the court of appeal, however, rejected that argument, finding koury and hernandez could assert fourth amendment claims. koury and his wife were still legally married; koury had a key to the residence and regularly visited overnight. this evidence of joint control of the premises was sufficient to support right to challenge the search of containers seized during an unlawful search of his home. although the court also held hernandez had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his own luggage and closed containers and thus had standing to challenge the search of those items, it did not hold, as aguiar suggests, koury could challenge the search of sions if the search of the house itself was otherwise lawful. (people v. koury, supra, 214 cal.app.3d at p. 689.) because the hearing on the suppression assert a fourth amendment violation, the court remanded for the trial court to consider properly raised at oral argument]; new plumbing contractors inc. v. nationwide mutual ins. co.

(id. at p. 691.) like koury, aguiar has a reasonable expectation of privacy in his home9 and may assert a fourth amendment violation if the purse containing the incriminating evidence plain sight of where the officers had a legitimate right to be and thus not discovered rights. the superior court made no express finding on this point, and none may be and direct respondent court to vacate its order denying the motion to suppress and to determine, either on the basis of the existing evidentiary record or with additional testimony, whether the purse and its contents were the fruits of an unlawful search of 9 at oral argument the people alleged villarroel had obtained a restraining order against aguiar, thus vitiating any expectation of privacy he would have otherwise had in the home. there is no evidence as to the scope of the restraining order in the record. the mere fact of the restraining order itself, without more, is insufficient to eliminate any people v. thompson (1996) 43 cal.app.4th 1265, 1270 [restraining order obtained by landlord against defendant did not deprive defendant of legitimate expectation of privacy in premises defendant rented from landlord when defendant had not been lawfully evicted, had a private room in which he kept his personal property and retained a key].) 13 disposition the petition is granted. let a peremptory writ of mandate issue directing respondent los angeles superior court to vacate its order of october 19, 2012 denying the first instance whether the purse and its contents were the fruits of an unlawful search onduct further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. perluss, p. j. we concur: woods, j. zelon, j.
