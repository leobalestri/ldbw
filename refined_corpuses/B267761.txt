(capitalization omitted.) the court found appellant guilty, found a factual basis for the plea, and dismissed the other counts and the allegations. under the plea agreement, the court sentenced appellant to a total of 15 years in state prison, consisting of the lower term of five years as to count 1 plus a consecutive term of 10 years for the section 12022.53, subdivision (b) enhancement. the court also imposed a restitution fine of $300 ( 1202.4, subd.

(people v. wende (1979) 25 cal.3d 436.) on april 16, 2016, we directed appointed counsel to immediately send the record on appeal and a copy of the opening brief to appellant. we notified appellant that within 30 days from the date of the notice he could submit by letter or brief any ground of appeal, contention or argument he wished us to consider. we received no response. plea limits his challenge on appeal. the matters that appellant raised in his request for a certificate of probable cause relate to the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the charge and the enhancement. an argument that sufficient evidence did not support the conviction, however, or without a certificate of probable cause. (people v. palmer (2013) 58 cal.4th 110, 114; see people v. turner (1985) 171 cal.app.3d 116, 125-126 [athe prosecution has admissible evidence sufficient to prove the charges and thus waives any right to raise questions about the evidence or have a conviction reviewed on the merits].) appellant did not identify any issue with respect to the validity of the plea or the circumstances related to his plea agreement, nor does any appear in the record. in addition, appellant did not list any noncertificate2 grounds in his notice of appeal nor submit a brief or letter advancing any such grounds. further, our own review has not identified any noncertificate issue warranting appellate review. we are satisfied that appointed counsel has complied with his responsibilities, and our review of the entire record has disclosed that no arguable issues exist that would result in a disposition more favorable to appellant. (people v. kelly (2006) 40 cal.4th 2 a defendant may obtain review on appeal of so-called noncertificate issues which do not require a certificate of probable cause. noncertificate issues are denial of a motion to suppress evidence under penal code section 1538.5or . (cal. rules of court, rule 8.304(b)(4).) 4 106, 109-110; people v. wende, supra, 25 cal.3d at p. 441.) in examining the record in this case, however, we noticed a typographical error in the abstract of judgment. as he trial court imposed a total sentence of 15 years in state prison. the abstract of judgment erroneously indicates that the total time imposed is five years. we have inherent power to correct clerical errors in the abstract of judgment. (people v. mitchell (2001) 26 cal.4th 181, 185.) disposition the judgment is affirmed. the trial court is directed to prepare a corrected abstract of judgment with the correct total sentence of 15 years, and to forward the corrected abstract of judgment to the california department of corrections and rehabilitation. not to be published. rothschild, p. j. we concur: johnson, j. lui, j.
