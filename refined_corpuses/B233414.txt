(a)), and with having had 10 prior convictions for which he had served separate terms of imprisonment and failed to remain free from custody for five years after his release. that he had represented himself at the preliminary hearing and had stated that he had not e norm shapiro, orally advised king of those dangers and disadvantages. the court then questioned king about his ability to handle his own defense and to understand the consequences of that decision, determining that king had graduated paralegal training, that he had successfully represented himself in previous criminal proceedings, and that he was currently engaged to do legal research for a local law office. on that basis the court 4 concluded that king met the minimum qualifications for self-representation, and granted his request for pro. per. status. king then pleaded not guilty and denied the prior prison term enhancement allegations. on april 27, 2011 the court (again judge fisher) heard written motions king had filed on march 30, 2011, to set aside the information (pen. code,  995), and to suppress the evidence of cocaine and return the $179 that had been seized when he was arrested (pen. code,  1538.5).2 the section 995 motion sought to set aside the information on two grounds: (1) the magistrapermitting king to testify at the preliminary hearing without either being represented by 66.5 requires; and (2) the absence of evidence at the march 16, 2011 preliminary hearing to establish probable cause that he had violated the crime search and return of the items seized from him at the time of his arrest, arguing that the evidence presented at the preliminary hearing failed to establish that the police had motion, filed by king on april 27, 2011, argued that since no cocaine was found on any of those with him when he was arrested, the police had no probable cause to believe that his $179 came from sales of cocaine. er hearing the people presented the testimony of police officers about their observations at the time top arguing about its 2 all further statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise specified. 5 evidentiary rulings once the rulings were made, the court called a halt to the hearing, when the hearing resumed, king was represented by appointed counsel, who did not prevention act of 2000). king signed and filed a five-waiver, and plea form for felonies and/or misdemeanors proposition 36 (penal that king had signed and filed on march 4, 2011, in this form, too, king affirmed his understanding of his right to be represented by an attorney, without charge if he were unable to afford the cost, and his understanding of the dangers and disadvantage of giving up that right, as well as his rights to a jury trial, to confront witnesses, against self-incrimination, and to produce evidence on his own behalf. the april 27, 2011 proposition 36 waiver form also required king to affirm his lso have all of the above constitutional rights at the all the charges in this case, including any prior convictions or probation violations, which may be presencounsel affirmed in writing that he had consulted with king with respect to each of the his constitutional rights. contest. it found king guilty of the health & safety code section 11350, subdivision (a), violation. on april 27, 2011 king was given a suspended sentence of one year of probation under the terms of sections 1210 and 1210.1, which had been enacted in 2000 by the proposition 36 initiative. king filed a handwritten notice of appeal from the final judgment of conviction on 6 right to dismissal pursuant to penal code 995, as required by mccarthy vs. superior court (1958) 57 cal.app.2d 755, 758-an amended notice of appeal, fvalidity, and upon the denial of the section 1538.5 motion to suppress evidence.3 on october 19, 2011, forth a summary of the facts and proceedings with citations to the transcript, but raised modification of the judgment. (people v. wende (1979) 25 cal.3d 436, 441-442; anders v. state of california (1967) 386 u.s. 738, 744, 87 s.ct. 1396.)4 after review, this court requested counsel to provide letter briefs addressing whether the superior court erred by failing to gbehalf at his march 16, 2011 preliminary hearing, as required by section 866.5. (see gov. code,  68081.) the responsive letter-unrepresented by counsel at his preliminary hearing, without having been advised of his right to counsel as required by section 866.5, the commitment order and information were invalidly obtained and should have been set aside in response to his march 30, 2011 motion under section 995. because the charge against him should have been set aside before his plea was taken, king argues, his conviction must be reversed. we do not agree. 3 on july 11, 2011 this court received a 15-page legibly hand-from king. on august 2, 2011 we denied permission to file the brief in propria persona, forwarded to his counsel. 4 ration stating that he had informed king of his right to submit by brief or letter any grounds of appeal, contentions, or argument he wished this court to consider, within 30 days. (people v. wende, supra, 25 cal.3d at pp. 441-442.) this court has received no further response from king. 7 discussion hat right. he is correct that the record contains no indication that he was advised of his right to counsel at his april 16 preliminary examination hearingalthough it shows that on march 4, 2011 he unambiguously acknowledged receiving detailed written notice of his right to counsel written waiver of that right. he is also correct that the advice-of-counsel provision of section 866.5 has long been held to be mandatory. a failure to advise a defendant at his preliminary hearing of his right to appointed counselbefore he testifies, as section 866.5 explicitly requiresrenders his commitment unlawful within the meaning of penal code section 995. and that is true even if he had earlier been advised of, and had knowingly waived, that right. (mccarthy vs. superior court (1958) 162 cal.app.2d 755, 758-759.)5 king is not correct, however, that the section 866.5 violation at his preliminary e to set aside the charge against him as a result of that violation, entitle him to automatic reversal of his conviction on appeal, without any showing that he was prejudiced by those errors. nor is he correct that prejudice is shown because his convictioset aside the charge against him. 5 states constitution is not coterminous with his statutory right to the assistance of counsel under california law. (people v. crayton (2002) 28 cal.4th 346, 361.) king does not argue that his waiver of counsel at the march 4, 2011 hearing was insufficient under the sixth amendment to the united states constitution to waive his right to counsel at subsequent proceedings. 8 the law that he cites to support these contentionspeople v. elliot (1960) 54 cal.2d 498, 504-505has been expressly repudiated and overruled.6 it is now the rule ground of reversal on appeal only if it in some way prejudiced defendant at his people v. pompa-ortiz (1980) 27 cal.3d 519, 523, citing cal. const., which are not jurisdictional in the fundamental sense shall be reviewed under the appropriate standard of prejudicial error and shall require reversal only if defendant can show that he was deprived of a fair trial or otherwise suffered prejudice as a result of the id. at p. 529 [citing harmless error standard of prejudice].) the record contains no basis for a determination that the error urged by king prejudiced him in any way. in people v. pompa-ortiz, supra, 27 cal.3d 519, the objection, denying him his statutory right to a right the denial of which entitled him to have the information set aside pursuant to section id. at pp. 525-526.) but in pompa-ortiz aside the charges under section 995 nevertheless did not require reversal of his conviction, because the record revealed no way in which the defendant had been prejudiced by the error in failing to grant his section 995 motion. the error therefore was (people v. pompa-ortiz, supra, 27 cal.3d at p. 530.) so, too, in this case the record shows that king suffered no prejudice resulting to counsel at the preliminary hearing, and its failure to set aside the charges against him in response to his section 995 motion. when king withdrew his plea of not guilty when he pled under 6 before it was overruled, people v. elliot, supra 9 proposition 36, he was represented by counsel. at that time he affirmed, in writingthat he had been advised about his constitutional rights, and that he waived those rights. his written waiver specifically this case . . . which moreover, although king had earlier testified at his preliminary hearing without the benefit of counsel, his preliminary hearing testimony apparently revealed nothing that could have prejudiced his defenses to the charge against him (even if he had not later withdrawn his not guilty plea after obtaining counsel). nothing suggests that anything in his preliminary examination testimony could have increased his vulnerability to the the case had gone to trial. his failure to have the information set aside due to his preliminary hearing testimony without having been readvised of his right to counsel, people v. white (1963) 213 cal.app.2d 171, 176.) in this case, as in people v. white, supra, 213 cal.app.2d at page 176, and people v. pompa-ortiz, supra, 27 cal.3d at page 530, the error in failing to grant the section 995 motion to set aside the charge therefore was of no consequence. king had represented to the trial court his training and experience in the law, and had demonstrated his clear understanding of the intricacies of pretrial procedures. he had shown himself to be literate, to be very familiar with the facts of his case, and to be competent to logically and intelligently understand the charge against him and his defenses to that charge. and he had repeatedly expressed his unequivocal intention to represent himself throughout the second preliminary examination followed by the filing of a new information, with the eventual result that defendant would have found himself slightly older but in exactly the (people v. white, supra, 213 cal.app.2d at p. 176; see people v. crayton, supra, 28 cal.4th at pp. 365-366 [error in failing to comply with statutory duty to readvise defendant of right to appointed counsel was not prejudicial under harmless 10 error standard of people v. watson (1956) 46 cal.2d 818, 836, where record shows earlier unequivocal waiver of counsel and absence of reasonable probability that repeated advice throughout the proceedings].) we therefore affirm the judgment. disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published. chaney, j. we concur: mallano, p. j. rothschild, j.
