a search of s not to leave fingerprints at the scene; use cell phones as way to communicate with accomplices via a direct-connect feature; carry pepper spray to silence dogs or distract persons found in the home being burglarized;

his proximity to the burglarized home; his egress from the property adjacent to the injuries consistent with an attempt to scale a wall. the prosecution argued the presence of an accomplice was demonstrated by the gloves, crowbar, and screwdriver found at the . . . the defendant is right next gloves. with pepper spray. a long way from home. . . . the inference is that [defendant] the jury convicted defendant of one count of burglary, and found true the prior conviction allegations. the trial court sentenced defendant to a term of 35 years to life consisting of 25 years to life on the burglary count, plus two five-year enhancements for the two prior conviction allegations. discussion i. conviction defendant argues insufficient evidence supports his burglary conviction, either as a principal or as an aider and abetter because there was no evidence defendant entered the house at 5404 konya, and as an accomplice, there was no evidence he was present at the crime scene, was in the company of the principal, or fled from the scene. respondent argues that there was evidence defendant was directly involved in the burglary based upon his possession of gloves (used to conceal fingerprints) and pepper spray (defense against dogs or unanticipated residents); furthermore, there was evidence he was involved al 6 cellphone. tenement, shop, warehouse, store, mill, barn, stable, outhouse or other building, tent, vessel, . . . with intent to commit grand or petit larceny or any felony is guilty of (1) entry into a structure, (2) with the intent to commit theft or any felpeople v. anderson (2009) 47 cal.4th 92, 101.) the crime is complete when the defendant enters one of the statutorily specified premises with the intent to steal something or commit any felony; a burglary can be committed without an actual taking of property. (people v. magallanes (2009) 173 cal.app.4th 529, 535536.) . . . one who is liable to prosecution for the identical offense people v. boyer (2006) 38 cal.4th 412, 467.) section 31 provi . . . whether they directly commit the act constituting the offense, or aid and abet in its commission, or, not being present, have advised and encouraged its commission . . . are principals in any people v. beeman (1984) 35 cal.3d often blurred. it is often an oversimplification to describe one person as the actual perpetrator and the other as the aider and abettor. when two or more persons commit a crime together, both may act in part as the actual perpetrator and in part as the aider and people v. mccoy crime is not entirely vicarious. rather, that guilt is based on a combination of the direct own acts and own id. at p. 1117.) 7 y for an offense is predicated upon the theory that he or she prior to or during people v. cooper (1991) 53 cal.3d 1158, 1164.) aiding and abetting a specific intent crime such as burglary requires the aider and abetter to share the specific intent of the principal. (people v. beeman, supra, 35 cal.3d at p. 560.) a conviction of burglary may be based upon circumstantial evidence. (people v. d.m.g. are usually committed in secret, the proof of the corpus deliciti generally must rest on (people v. jordan (1962) 204 cal.app.2d 782, 786.) although mere presence at a crime scene and failure to prevent the crime, even with trier of fact may consider such circumstances in determining aiding and abetting liability. (people v. nguyen (1993) 21 cal.app.4th 518, 529530.) an unexplained presence at the scene of a crime implies complicity. (people v. wilson (1928) 93 cal.app. 632, 636.) other circumstances to be considered are companionship, and conduct before and after the offense, including flight, which can indicate guilt. (in re lynette g. (1976) 54 cal.app.3d 1087, 1094; people v. london consistently held that one who was present for the purpose of diverting suspicion, or to liable as an aider and abettor, and thus a principal in the crime committed. (people v. silva (1956) 143 cal.app.2d 162, 169.) whether a person is an accomplice is a question of fact for the jury, unless there is no dispute as to the facts or the inferences to be drawn from them. (people v. avila (2006) 38 cal.4th 491, 565.) here, sufficient edefendant was in the backyard of the adjacent house after having scaled a cinderblock fence, he was perspiring, arguably indication of exertion or nervousness, had burglary implements on him, an- 8 were present. second, accomplice liability requires a showing that defendant aided the and with the intent or purpose to aid or assist in committing the underlying burglary.

(evid. code,  353, subd. (a); see also people v. williams, supra, 20 cal.4th at p. 130 [party may not offer on appeal theory of suppression not offered in the trial court].) nevertheless, in order to avert a meritless claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, we note that even if the issue were not forfeited, no error occurred. any warrantless search is unreasonable unless it falls within one of the recognized exceptions to the warrant requirement. (katz v. united states (1967) 389 u.s. 347, 357 [88 s.ct. 507, 19 l.ed.2d 576].) the burden of proving that a search falls within one of these exceptions rests with the people. (people v. williams, supra, 20 cal.4th at p. 130.) justify a police officer stopping and briefly detaining a person for questioning or other limited investigation. [citations.] although each case must be decided on its own facts, our decisions. [citations.] [] . . . [] [i]n order to justify an investigative stop or detention the circumstances known or apparent to the officer must include specific and articulable facts causing him to suspect that (1) some activity relating to crime has taken place or is occurring or about to occur, and (2) the person he intends to stop or detain is involved in that activity. not only must he subjectively entertain such a suspicion, but it must be objectively reasonable for him to do so: the facts must be such as would cause any reasonable police officer in a like position, drawing when appropriate on his training and experience [citation], to suspect the same criminal activity and the same involvement by the person in question. the corollary to this rule, of course, is that an investigative stop or detention predicated on mere curiosity, rumor, or hunch is unlawful, even though in re tony c. (1978) 21 cal.3d 888, 892893, fn. omitted.) during such stop, the officer may perform a patsearch for weapons if he or she believes the suspect is armed and dangerous to the officers or others. 10 (terry v. ohio (1968) 392 u.s. 1, 24 [88 s.ct. 1868, 20 l.ed.2d 889]; people v. lindsey (2007) 148 cal.app.4th 1390, 13951396.) fapeople v. limon (1993) 17 cal.app.4th 524, 532.) further, where burglary is the suspected crime, it is reasonable for police to believe the suspected burglar may be armed. (people v. osborne (2009) 175 cal.app.4th 1052, 10591060.) here, officer waldrop was immediately suspicious of defendant based upon his emergence from the house on michelle in a disheveled appearance. defendant was sweating, talking on his cell phone seeking a means escape by calling someone, stating he needed a ride because -was nearby, and ran away when officer waldrop approached him. officer waldrop was aware a burglary had occurred nearby, the house on michelle had a high stone wall, and defendant moaned in pain when his leg was touched. these observations constituted objective evidence that activity relating to a crime had taken place and defendant was his pant leg. disposition the judgment is affirmed. johnson, j. we concur: rothschild, acting p. j. chaney, j.
