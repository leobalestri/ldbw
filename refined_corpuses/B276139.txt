filed 2/6/17 p. v. vigil ca2/2 not to be published in the official reports california rules of court, rule 8.1115(a), prohibits courts and parties from citing or relying on opinions not certified for publication or ordered published, except as specified by rule 8.1115(b). this opinion has not been certified for publication or ordered published for purposes of rule 8.1115. in the court of appeal of the state of california second appellate district division two the people, plaintiff and respondent, v. arcenio vigil, defendant and appellant. b276139 (los angeles county super. ct. no. ya026169) appeal from an order of the superior court of los angeles county. steven r. van sicklen, judge. affirmed. eduardo a. parades for defendant and appellant kamala d. harris and xavier becerra, attorneys general, gerald a. engler, chief assistant attorney general, lance e. winters, assistant attorney general, steven d. matthews and yun k. lee, deputy attorneys general, for plaintiff and respondent. ___________________________________________________ 2 in july 1996, defendant arcenio vigil entered an open plea of guilty to second degree robbery (pen. code,  2111), and admitted to firearm allegations under section 12022.5, subdivision (a). defendant faced a potential maximum total punishment of 15 years in state prison. the trial court sentenced him to a total of nine years in state prison. nearly 20 years later, in april 2016, defendant filed a motion to vacate the judgment and his plea pursuant to section 1016.5. he contended he was not adequately advised of the potential immigration consequences of his guilty plea. the trial court denied the motion to vacate. finding no abuse of discretion, we affirm. background when pleading guilty in 1996, defendant signed a standard plea form. (in re tahl (1969) 1 cal.3d 122.) that form included a paragraph stating the of the united states, the conviction for the offense charged may have the consequences of deportation, exclusion from admission to the united states, defendant initialed and placed a check mark next to this paragraph, as he did next to all other advisements on the tahl form. he declared by his above boxes and discussed them with my attorney. i understand each and every one of the rights outlined above and i hereby waive and give up each of tahl rights to the defendant, and having explored the facts with him . . . and studied his . . . possible defenses to the charge(s), i concur in his . . . decision 1 all further statutory references are to the penal code. 3 2 the trial court found waiver in the form. in april 2016, defendant filed a motion to vacate his 1996 judgment and plea pursuant to section 1016.5. he argued that the advisement he received regarding the plea agreement was insufficient because he was not informed his removal and permanent exclusion from the united states was a definite consequence of the plea. defendant was apparently deported in or around 2003. in connection with his motion to vacate, he provided a declaration from his residence in el salvador stating that, in 1996, he advised his attorney that he was not guilty of robbery but that his attorney advised him to plead guilty. according to the sentence of 15 to 25 years. defendant further declared that the attorney never told him he would be deported if he pled guilty, and that if he had been so informed, he would not have entered a guilty plea. at the hearing on the motion to vacate the plea, the trial court found that the tahl form was validly executed and was a sufficient advisement of the trouble he was in. he had already been deported once. and signing this waiver, he knew themotion. 2 s transcript of the 1996 hearing could be located when defendant filed his motion to vacate. 4 discussion prior to acceptance of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, the trial court you are hereby advised that conviction of the offense for which you have been charged may have the consequences of deportation, exclusion from admission to the united states, or denial of naturalization pursuant to the laws of the may move to vacate the judgment and the plea. ( 1016.5, subd. (b).) must establish that (1) he or she was not properly advised of the immigration consequences as provided by the statute; (2) there exists, at the time of the motion, more than a remote possibility that the conviction will have one or more of the specified adverse immigration consequences; and (3) he or she people v. totari (2002) 28 cal.4th 876, 884.) in attempting to establish prejudice, the defendant must prove, by declaration or testimony, that he or she would not have entered into the plea bargain if given the proper advisement. (people v. martinez (2013) 57 cal.4th assertion is credible, and the court may reject an assertion that is not ibid.) for abuse of discretion. (people v. superior court (zamudio) (2000) 23 cal.4th 183, 192 (zamudio).) evidence showed defendant was given a proper advisement. the language pertaining to immigration consequences in the tahl form signed by defendant was effectively identical to the language required by section 5 people v. araujo (2016) 243 cal.app.4th 759, 762 (araujo).) substantial compliance with the language of section 1016.5 is all that is required (zamudio, supra, 23 cal.4th 183, 207-208), and substantial compliance certainly was present here. the advisement was also proper in that it informed defendant of possible deportation consequences. section 1016.5 only requires a defendant zamudio, supra, 23 cal.4th at p. 209.) it does not require an admonishment of the specific immigration consequences of a plea. (ibid.; araujo, supra, 243 cal.app.4th 759, 763.) the trial court also did not abuse it discretion in finding that defendant failed to show he was prejudiced by any alleged deficiency in the advisement. in his declaration, defendant stated he would not have pled guilty if he had known he would be deported. similar self-serving declarations have been found insufficient to establish prejudice. (see araujo, supra, 243 cal.app.4th 759, 763; in re resendiz (2001) 25 cal.4th 230, 253 [criticized on other grounds in padilla v. kentucky (2010) 559 u.s. 356, 370 (padilla)]is true that by insisting on trial petitioner would for a period have retained a theoretical possibility of evading the conviction that rendered him deportable and excludable, it is equally true that a conviction following trial would have in re resendiz, at p. 254.) the trial court here found defendant, contrary to his declaration, knew the copeople v. martinez, supra, 57 cal.4th 555, 565.) 6 defendant argues that padilla order. padilla, however, involved ineffective assistance of counsel, not a trial consequences. padilla held that defense counsel must inform the defendant whether a plea carries a risk of deportation. (559 u.s. 356, 373-374.) defendant here did not base his motion to vacate, or his appeal, on ineffective assistance of counsel. even if he had, such an argument could not be properly raised in a motion under section 1016.5. (people v. kim (2009) 45 cal.4th 1078, 1107-1108, fn. 20 defendant regarding the possible immigration consequences of his plea, and his further claim that his trial attorney was somehow ineffective is not a ; people v. chien (2008) 159 cal.app.4th 1283, 1290.) for the first time, on appeal, defendant argues that section 1016.2 required the trial court to apply padilla. defendant did not raise this argument below and thereby forfeited it. even if he had raised it below, reversal would not be warranted. section 1016.2 codifies the holding of padilla affirmative and competent advice to noncitizen defendants regarding the potential immigration consesubds. (a), (h).) section 1016.2, which became effective january 1, 2016, people v. sandoval (2007) 41 cal.4th 825, 845.) and padilla itself has been held to apply only to defendants whose convictions became final after padilla was decided in 2010. (chaidez v. united states (2013) __ u.s. __ [133 s.ct. 1103, 1113].) 7 finally, defendant argues that people v. soriano (1987) 194 cal.app.3d 1470 provides a basis for his ineffective assistance of counsel claim. soriano concluded that if defense counsel gives advice regarding immigration consequences, he or she must give adequate advice, but the opinion did not require counsel to give such advice in the first place. (id. at pp. 1477-1482; see people v. reed (1998) 62 cal.app.4th 593, 602 [finding soriano inapposite .) here, defendant contends only that his attorney failed to provide any advice about immigration consequences, and so soriano would not apply. even if the circumstances in soriano were analogous to those in this case, soriano would not provide a basis for vacating the plea under section 1016.5. (see people v. kim, supra, 45 cal.4th 1078, 1107.) furthermore, defendant fails to show that the trial court erred in finding that defendant was not prejudiced by any asserted improper advisement. in sum, defendant was properly given the statutorily required advisement, and the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying disposition judgment and plea is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. goodman, j.* we concur: chavez, j., acting p.j. hoffstadt, j. * retired judge of the los angeles superior court assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
