( 1202.4, subd. (b), (c).) at the time appellant entered his plea and was sentenced, the minimum fine for a person convicted of a felony was $200. (former  1202.4, subds. (b)(1), (c), (d).)4 the sentencing court has the discretion to impose a fine of up to $10,000, after assessing factors deemed relevant, although the court is not required to conduct a hearing or to make express findings as to those factors. (see  1202.4, subds. (b)(2), (d) [listing various factors a court may consider in setting the fine amount].) in addition, the trial court is obligated to impose a parole revocation fine on restitution fine under section 1202.4, subdivision (b). (ibid.) defendants may negotiate 4 as of january 1, 2012, the minimum restitution fine increased from $200 to $240. ( 1202.4, subd. (b)(1), as amended by stats. 2011, ch. 358,  1.) 4 the amount of these mandatory fines as part of their plea agreement. (people v. villalobos (2012) 54 cal.4th 177, 181.) here, although the parties did not negotiate the amount of the restitution and parole revocation fines as part of the plea agreement, prior to the entry of the plea, the trial court advised appellant that it would impose no more than the statutory minimum amounts for those fines. appellant contends, the people acknowledge and we agree that because the trial court subsequently ordered appellant to pay restitution and parole revocation fines greater than the promised statutory minimum of $200, the amount of those fines must be reduced. (compare with people v. villabos, supra, 54 cal.4th 177, negotiation, and where the trial court has not threatened or promised any particular amount of fine during the plea colloquy, the amount of the fine is not part of the plea disposition the judgment is modified to reduce the $1,200 restitution and parole revocation fines to $200. as modified the judgment is affirmed. zelon, j. we concur: woods, acting p. j. jackson, j.
