filed 12/22/16 p. v. hall ca2/2 not to be published in the official reports california rules of court, rule 8.1115(a), prohibits courts and parties from citing or relying on opinions not certified for publication or ordered published, except as specified by rule 8.1115(b). this opinion has not been certified for publication or ordered published for purposes of rule 8.1115. in the court of appeal of the state of california second appellate district division two the people, plaintiff and respondent, v. rodrick clay hall, defendant and appellant. b267218 (los angeles county super. ct. no. ba413482) appeal from a judgment of the superior court of los angeles county. anne h. egerton, judge. affirmed, as modified. allen g. weinberg, under appointment by the court of appeal, for defendant and appellant. kamala d. harris, attorney general, gerald a. engler, chief assistant attorney general, lance e. winters, senior assistant attorney general, jaime l. fuster and joseph p. lee, deputy attorneys general, for plaintiff and respondent. * * * * * * 2 a jury convicted rodrick clay hall (defendant) of murdering his half brother. in this appeal, defendant argues that the trial court erred in not granting him a new trial due to newly discovered evidence and in imposing a $5,000 restitution award without making it part of the oral pronouncement of second; we accordingly affirm his conviction but vacate the restitution award. facts and procedural background i. facts in early 2013, defendant lived in one unit of a duplex with his aunt, wanetta brother and grandmother lived in the other unit. one saturday morning in june 2013, defendant heard his half brother yelling at the grandmother in their unit. when defendant entered that unit, he saw his half brother, peavy, and his grandmother. his half objects (namely, kill the grandmother. the half brother had some sort of long kitchen knife in his hand, which defendknife. the half brother escorted defendant out of the unidoor, closed the door, and locked it. defendant then retrieved a loaded gun he knew was hidden unit to get the front door key for his half unit. defendant shouted through and banged on the half brotherseconds, and then he unlocked the door and entered. within 30 seconds, defendant fired a single bullet at his half brother that pierced the half oth his lungs, and his heart. 3 less than a minute after the gunshot, a neighbor heard a man x. defendant immediately left the unit and changed clothes in his own unit. by the time he was leaving his unit, the police had arrived. when an officer asked defendant his name, defendant gave a false name that was a variation on his real name (either defendant thereafter disposed of the gun by tossing it into the sewer or some bushes. f brother died soon thereafter. ii. procedural background the people charged defendant with murder (pen. code,  187, subd. (a))1 and further alleged that he personally discharged a firearm ( 12022.53, subd. (d)). defendant went to trial. at trial, defendant took the stand ally believe[d]his half brother was going to hurt his grandmother. he also conceded that he brother. the trial court instructed the jury on the crimes of murder (both first and second degree) and on voluntary manslaughter (both due to heat of passion and due to imperfect self-defense and defense of others). the court also instructed the jury on perfect self-defense and defense of others. the jury found defendant guilty of second degree murder and found the firearm allegation to be true. in so finding, the jury necessarily rejected both types of self-defense and defense of others. 1 all further statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise indicated. 4 the trial court sentenced defendant to prison for 40 years to life, comprised of 15 years to life for the murder plus an additional 25 years for the personal discharge of the firearm. at the sentencing hearing, the court imposed a $280 restitution fine but no restitution award. in the minute order and abstract of judgment, however, the court imposed a $5,000 restitution award. defendant filed this timely appeal. discussion i. denial of new trial motion defendant argues that the trial court erred in denying his new trial motion. we review such denials for an abuse of discretion. (people v. mccurdy (2014) 59 cal.4th 1063, 1108.) a. pertinent facts in a postarrest interview, defendant told police that his aunt, peavy, was in the duplex unit when he shot his half brother. however, defendant did not call peavy as a witness at trial. instead, five and a half months after the jury returned its testimony constituted the motion proffered that peavy would testify that, just before the shooting, threatened both peavy and the grandmother. in support of the motion, defendant did not submit a signed affidavit from peavy. instead, he submitted (1) an unsigned affidavit from peavy, (2) a stating that, according to peavy, the facts outlined in her unsigned affidavit were the and (3) two affidavitsone signed and one unsigneds stating that, soon after 5 the shooting, peavy had told them the facts outlined in unsigned declaration. the trial court denied the motion for a new trial. the court cited three reasons: ony was not [d] been known to [defendant] and proffered testimony was not credible because her declaration (a) was inconsistent with her recorded statements to a 911 operator immediately after the shooting in which she denied knowing who did the shooting, and (b) testimony regarding when his half brother had the knife in his hands; and (3) d was thus incompetent evidencerequests (1) to call peavy as a witness at the hearing on the motion, and (2) to grant peavy immunity to testify, finding that the potentially incriminating portion of her proffered testimonynamely, that peavy moved the knife to the tablewas not in actuality incriminating. b. analysis a trial court may grant a new trial in a criminal case on the basis of newly discovered evidence. ( 1181, subd. 8.) to obtain such relief, a defendant must establish that (1) the evidence itself] discovered and produced . . . at . . . that is, ipeople v. beeler (1995) 9 cal.4th 953, 1004 (beeler), quoting people v. delgado (1993) 5 cal.4th 312, 328 (delgado); people v. mehserle 6 (2012) 206 cal.app.4th 1125, 1151.) motions for a new trial on this ground people v. love (1959) 51 cal.2d 751, 757.) the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying def a new trial. the statute authorizing new trials requires a defendant to evidence is expected to be given . . . .( 1181, subd. 8; beeler, supra, 9 cal.4th at p. 1005.) here, defendant only produced (1) an unsigned affidavit by peavy, and (2) the affidavits of others recitation of the facts set forth in her witchell v. de korne (1986) 179 cal.app.3d 965, 975) and is consequently entitled to , people v. cox (1991) 53 cal.3d 618, 697, overruled on other grounds by people v. doolin (2009) 45 cal.4th -of-court statements, which are hearsay and thus also entitled to no weight. (evid. code,  1200 et seq.; cox, at p. 697 [hearsay cannot impeach a verdict].) newly discovered nor material. defendant knew peavy was present when he shot his half brother. (see people v. verdugo (2010) 50 cal.4th 263, 309 t 7 defendant argues that peavy should be deemed to be newly discovered because the people had charged her with being an accessory after the fact to the half r and, although those charges had been dismissed, the threat of prosecution still remained. we reject this argument for four reasons. first, this argument is inconsistent with the reason peavy gives in her unsigned affidavit for not coming forward earlierpeople [she] need[ed] to discuss [her testimony] with [were] the very people who ha[d] held [her] as an emotional ho the time of trial insofar as he could have asked the court to grant peavy immunity under the law in effect at that time (see in re williams (1994) 7 cal.4th 572, 610; people v. masters (2016) 62 cal.4th 1019, 1051), but never did. third, this argument rests on the premise that peavy faced a threat of prosecution, but the conduct peavy admits tomoving the knife to the table and telling defendant to leave immediately after the shootingis not incriminating, so there is no need for immunity. (see hudec v. superior court (2015) 60 cal.4th 815, 819 [privilege against self-incrimination only applies to incriminating statements].) ing and case becomes newly discovered simply because the source of that evidence could have asserted their privilege against self-incrimination. (see people v. prantil (1985) 169 cal.app.3d 592, 611-612.) already testified that his half brother was angry and carrying a 8 [d]that his half brother was going to hurt his grandmother. the jury nevertheless rejected his claim that he acted to defend her, due no doubt to the contrary evidence that defendant major dhim; fled the scene; evaded police; and disposed of the gun. testimonynamely, that the half brother was angry and had a knifewould have added nothing to the evidence already before the jury. additionally, was not relevant to establish either perfect or imperfect defense of others. imperfect defense of others requires proof that a . believe[d] in the need perfect defense of others also requires ppeople v. humphrey (1996) 13 cal.4th 1073, 1082.) peavy was not competent to testify about what defendant actually, subjectively believed (gherman v. colburn (1977) 72 cal.app.3d 544, 582 [tinor about what a reasonable person would have thought under the circumstances (humphrey, at pp. 1098-1099 [expert may not testify to what a reasonable person would have done]; evid. code, based ). because it was not credible. (people v. howard (2010) 51 cal.4th 15, 43 [trial court may consider credibility in determining whether the result would differ]; delgado, supra, 5 cal.4th at p. 329 [same].) according to the proffer, peavy saw the half brother carrying the knife after the half brother escorted defendant out of the unit and watched defendant shoot the half 9 [w]entering the unit. this call, where she denied knowing who shot the half brother. this testimony is awhere he stated that his half brother had the knife before he escorted defendant out of the unit and that defendant shot his half brother 30 seconds after reentering the unit. defendant offers two further arguments. first, he asserts that the trial court erred in refusing to convene an evidentiary hearing at which he could call peavy to testify. as a procedural matter, it is unclear whether a trial court may consider anything beyond the affidavits called for by the new trial statute. (compare (1981) 114 cal.app.3d 824, 878-879 [new , disapproved on other grounds by people v. kimble (1988) 44 cal.3d 480, 498, with people v. shoals (1992) 8 cal.app.4th 475, 485, fn. 4 [noting that some courts still entertain live live testimony is of no moment because the trial court evaluated offered up in her unsigned declaration was true; having her come to court and or ruling. diligence to discover trial motion. (people v. martinez (1984) 36 cal.3d 816, 825-826.) thimself knew she was a percipient wicounsel were relevant, it is of no consequence because defendant 10 have affected the outcome of his trial. ii. imposition of restitution $5,000 restitution award because the court did not orally impose that award during sentencing, but instead imposed the award in the minute order and abstract of judgment after the fact. because this addresses whether the restitution statute authorizes an award under these circumstances, our review is de novo. (in re tommy a. (2005) 131 cal.app.4th 1580, 1586.) defendant is correct. in people v. zackery (2007) 147 cal.app.4th 380, 387-389, the court held that a trial court may not impose a mandatory restitution fine for the first time in a minute order; zackerys logic applies with even greater force to a disdefendant has the right to a hearing before a judge to dispute the determination of [mandatory restitution fines] with id., subd. (f)(1) [discretionary restitution award].) the people respond that the imposition of a restitution fine is mandatory and may be corrected at any time. a restitution fine, but with a restitution award; the former is mandatory, the latter is discretionary. accordingly, we vacate the $5,000 restitution award without prejudice to the people exercising their right, under section 1202.46, to seek a restitution award following a properly noticed hearing. 11 disposition the $5,000 restitution award is vacated. the judgment is otherwise affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. ______________________, j. hoffstadt we concur: _________________________, acting p. j. ashmann-gerst _________________________, j.* goodman * retired judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
