(pen. code,3  594, subd. (a).)4 a jury found ortega guilty of this charge. at sentencing, ortega requested the trial court exercise its discretion under section 17, subdivision (b) to reduce his felony vandalism conviction to a misdemeanor. ortega argued that he was almost 63 years old, had suffered two strokes and partial -free life until this the prosecution opposed the request. the trial court suspended imposition of sentence and placed ortega on three years of formal probation. the trial court ordered ortega to serve 206 days in county jail, immediately awarding him credit for 206 days. the trial court imposed a $300 restitution fine under section 1202.4, subdivision (b), a $40 court security assessment under section 1465.8, subdivision (a)(1), and a $30 criminal conviction assessment under government code section 70373, subdivision (a)(1). the trial court also ordered ortega to pay the probation department in a plan for anger may petition the court for reduction to a misdemeanor. if you are in compliance with all terms and conditions, if the restitution has 3 further unspecified statutory citations are to the penal code. 4 the information also charged ortega with injuring his cohabitant ( 273.5, subd. (a)), a charge arising from the purported domestic violence for which he was arrested. the jury acquitted ortega of this charge, and it is not at issue in this appeal. 4 been paid, anger management classes have been completed and all the court fines have been paid, i will seriously consider reducing it to a misdemeanor and the balance of the probationary period will be summar after ortega confirmed that long you stay on felony probation. really. the ball is in your th ortega timely appealed. discussion a. the trial court did not abuse its discretion by misdemeanor ortega argues the trial court abused its discretion when it declined to reduce his conviction to a misdemeanor at sentencing. we disagree. under section 17, subdivision (b), a trial court may reduce a in the discretion of the court, either by imprisonment in the state prison or imprisonment in a county jail under the provisions of subdivision (h) of section 1170, or by fine or imprisonment in the county jail( 17, subd. (b).) crimes meeting this definition, which may be punished as either a felony or a misdemeanor, are commonly see people v. park (2013) 56 cal.4th 782, 789790 (parkcausing damage over $400, is punishable by imprisonment pursuant to section 1170, subdivision (h)(1) or by fine or imprisonment in county jail ( 594, subd. (b)(1)); the parties do 5 a [trial] court ha[s] broad discretion under section 17, subdivision (b) in deciding whether to reduce a wobbler offense to a misdemeanor. [citation.] we will not disturb the courts decision on appeal unless the party attacking the decision clearly shows the decision was irrational or arbitrary. [citation.] absent such a showing, we presume the court acted to achieve legitimate sentencing objectives.people v. sy (2014) 223 cal.app.4th 44, 66 (sy).) in sy, the defendant moved under section 17, subdivision (b) to reduce her conviction for selling or possessing arguing the nature and circumstances of the offense, her remorse for it, and her character supported the reduction.sy, supra, 223 cal.app.4th at p. 66.) the motion at a later time after ensuring [the defendant] complied with the terms of her probation and did not continue ibid.) the court of appeal held the [t]he court considered motion and determined it was too soon to reduce her conviction. the court indicated it wanted an opportunity to consider her performance on probation before granting her request to ensure she did not resume selling counterfeit marks. nothing about the courts stated reasons for denying her motion indicate its decision was irrational or arbitrary, and [the defendant] has not clearly shown to the contrary.ibid.) sy is analogous to the instant case, in which the trial court misdemeanor after he had served 12 months of his three-year 6 probation.5 nothing about that decision appears irrational or sy, supra, 223 cal.app.4th at p. 66), by providing extra incentive for ortega to comply with the conditions of probation. ortega argues the trial court failed to give individualized ortega also complains that the trial court denied his reduction ortega cites no authority holding that the trial court must state on the record its reasons for denying a request under section 17, subdivision (b). in any event, the trial court did state its reasons, explaining that it was choosing to wait until ortega had served a year of probation, which included cooperating with the probation department on an anger management plan, before evaluating whether to reduce his conviction to a misdemeanor. a similar explanation was adequate in sy, and it is adequate here. b. the trial court was not required to determine assessments ortega contends the trial court violated his due process rights by imposing the restitution fine and court assessments without first determining that he had the ability to pay those 5 trial courts may reduce wobblers to misdemeanors at the for example, when park, supra, 56 cal.4th at p. 793.) 7 costs, citing dueas, supra, 30 cal.app.5th 1157. in light of our holding in caceres, supra, ___ cal.app.5th ___ [2019 d.a.r. 8861], we reject this argument.6 1. dueas in dueas, an unemployed, homeless mother with cerebral thousand dollars assessed against her for three juvenile citations. (dueas, supra, 30 cal.app.5th at pp. 11601161.) thereafter she received multiple convictions related to driving with a suspended license, each accompanied by jail time and additional fees she could not afford to pay. (id. at p. 1161.) following her fifth conviction arising from driving with a suspended license, and the imposition of a restitution fine and court assessments under section 1465.8 and government code section 70373 (the same assessments imposed on ortega in the instant case), dueas requested the trial court hold a hearing to determine her ability to pay those costs. (dueas, supra, 30 cal.app.5th at pp. 1161declaration establishing her indigence, the trial court ruled that 6 the attorney general argues that ortega forfeited his appellate challenge by failing to object to the fines and fees at sentencing. alternatively, the attorney general argues we against excessive fines, not due process. because we hold decide whether it was fines argument because ortega did not raise that issue in his opening brief. (see people v. spector (2011) 194 cal.app.4th 1335, 1372, fn. 12 [declining to address issue not raised properly in opening brief].) 8 the assessments were mandatory and dueas had not shown the restitution fine. (id. at p. 1163.) the court of appeal reversed, holding that due process prohibits a trial court from imposing court assessments under section 1465.8 and government code section 70373, and requires the trial court to stay execution of any restitution fines, until the assessments and fines. (dueas, supra, 30 cal.app.5th at p. 1164.) the court expressed concconsequences of imposing fines and assessments that a defendant from a series of criminal proceedings driven by, and contributing id. at pp. 11631164.) the court tendency to enmesh indigent defendants in a cycle of repeated id. at p. 1164, fn. 1.) in support of its due process argument, the dueas court referenced statutes waiving court costs for indigent civil litigants, and cited cases holding unconstitutional requirements that indigent criminal defendants pay costs to prosecute their appeals. (dueas, supra, 30 cal.app.5th at pp. 11651166, 1168.) the court reasoned that imposing costs on defendants who were subjecting the defendants to a civil judgment for nonpayment and the consequences thereof. (id. at p. 1168.) the court held that attempting to raise funds through assessments and fines imposed on defendants who cannot pay thefair 9 (id. at p. 1171, fn. 8.) the court further noted that defendants on probation who pay their fines are entitled to have their charges dismissed under section 1203.4, subdivision (a)(1), whereas . . . can try to persuade a trial court to exercise its discretion to grant them (dueas, at pp. 11701171.) 2. caceres in caceres, a defendant convicted of criminal threats relied on dueas to claim the trial court erred by imposing a restitution fine and court assessments without determining his ability to pay them. (caceres, supra, ___ cal.app.5th ___ [2019 d.a.r. 8863].) we rejected that argument, concluding that the due process analysis in dueas did not support its broad holding, and that the case was distinguishable on its facts. (ibid.)7 imposed following a criminal conviction and fees that, if imposed on indigent litigants or criminal defendants, impede their access s imposed after a case is completed, and judgment entered . . . do 8 7 two other courts have since issued opinions holding that dueas was wrongly decided. (see people v. hicks (sept. 24, 2019, b291307) ___ cal.app.5th ___ [2019 wl 4635156 at *1]; people v. aviles (sept. 13, 2019, f073846) ___ cal.app.5th ___, ___ [2019 cal.app.lexis 869 at *18*19.) 8 we acknowledge that in caceres and the instant case, the attorney general in his appellate briefing took the opposite position, agreeing with dueas that nonpunitive court assessments implicated due process when imposed on those who 10 (caceres, supra, ___ cal.app.5th ___ [2019 d.a.r. 8864].) we questioned the proposition in dueas that subjecting indigent defendants to civil judgments for nonpayment of fines and fees dueas relied defendants who, because of their poverty, were exposed to additional criminal id. at p. 8865.) we also questioned dueassome defendants would be unable to pay their fines and fees rendered the entire procedurally fair nor reasonably related to any proper legislative (ibid.) ust tailor the dueas in ss drastic remedial alternative current statutory scheme, which is more than what due process requires. (ibid.) given our concerns with the due process analysis in dueas trial caceres, supra, ___ cal.app.5th ___ [2019 d.a.r. 8865].) we also held that the facts as characterized in dueas were caceres, supra, ___ cal.app.5th ___ [2019 d.a.r. 8865].) in the dueas as too poor to pay her juvenile citations, then continued to offend because the aggregating criminal conviction assessments and fines prevented cannot pay them. (see caceres, supra, ___ cal.app.5th ___ [2019 d.a.r. 8866].) 11 her from recovering her license. the dueas court described this eries of criminal proceedings driven by, and contributing to, [a ibid.) poverty such that an offender is [citation.] a person may avoid making criminal threats regardless of his or her financial circumstances, and the imposition of $370 in fees and fines will caceres, supra, ___ cal.app.5th ___ [2019 d.a.r. 8865].) caceres cannot pay the imposed costs and is subject to a civil judgment, we are not persuaded that such a consequence violates ibid.) 3. analysis offe caceres, supra, ___ cal.app.5th ___ [2019 d.a.r. 8865].) as in caceres[committing vandalism] regardless of his or her financial circumstances, and the imposition of $370 in fees and fines will ibid.) dueas therefore is inapplicable to the facts of this case, and the trial court did not violate due process in imposing the fiability to pay. 12 in caceres the trial court did not grant caceres probation, and thus we did not address the holding in dueas that it violated due process to deny probationers unable to pay their fines an automatic right to have their charges dismissed under section 1203.4, subdivision (a)(1). (see caceres, supra, ___ cal.app.5th ___ [2019 d.a.r. 8864 & fn. 10, 8866]; dueas, supra, 30 cal.app.5th at pp. 11701171.) the trial court placed ortega on probation, thus arguably distinguishing the instant case from caceres on that point. unlike the dueas court, however, we do not think the issue ripe at this stage of the proceedings. it is possible ortega will pay the required costs by the time he completes probation, under section 1203.4, subdivision (a)(1). it is also possible ortega fails to complete probation for some reason other than his inability to pay the required costs. under any of those scenarios, there would be no need to consider the constitutional ramifications of denying relief under section 1203.4, subdivision assessments or fines. we therefore leave that question for another day. 13 disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published. bendix, j. we concur: johnson, acting p. j. weingart, j.* * judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
