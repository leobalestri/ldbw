(e)(2)(a)1) sentenced defendant eusebio banuelos (banuelos) to an indeterminate term of 25 years to life in prison. in 2013, banuelos filed a petition for recall of sentence pursuant to proposition 36 ( 1170.126) (the petition). in 2015, the court denied the petition and reconsideration (the motion). on appeal, banuelos advances three arguments. first, he contends that the orders denying the petition and the motion should be reversed because the trial court used the e trial court should have used the restrictive found in proposition 47 ( 1170.18). according to banuelos, because proposition 47 a]s used throughout this codedasubd. (c), italics added), proposition 47 imports its definition entire penal code, including, as relevant here, into 1 all further statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise indicated. 3 proposition 36 resentencing determinations. as a result, banuelos argues that the matter should be remanded to the trial court with instructions to either grant the petition or nition of dangerousness. in the alternative, banuelos argues that under any definition of that term, he did not pose such a risk. finally, banuelos maintains reversal is required because his counsel was ineffective. we disagree with all arguments and, accordingly, affirm. background i. on april 28, 1982, in two consolidated casesone for the robbery of a lucky grocery store ( 211); the other for an attempted robbery of an ( 664/211), with both crimes involving the use of a firearmthe court sentenced banuelos to prison terms of five years and four years, respectively, with the terms running concurrently. at the time, banuelos was 19 years old. on september 14, 1994, after a jury convicted banuelos of driving a vehicle without consent (veh. code,  10851, subd. (a)) and possession of stolen property ( 496), the court imposed an indeterminate term of 25 years to life, 4 pursuant to the three strikes law.2 at the time, banuelos was 31 years old. ii. the petition on or about march 1, 2013, banuelos filed the petition. at the time, banuelos was 50 years old and had served 18 years of his 25 years to life sentence. on march 7, 2013, in response to the petition, the trial court ordered the people to show cause as to why relief should not be granted pursuant to section 1170.126. on april 28 and may 7, 2015, the trial court held a hearing to proposition 36 ( 1170.126, subd. (f), (g)). for its case in chief, the people did not call any witnesses, but instead criminal history and his prison disciplinary record. the prison showed 11 serious rules violations between 1994 and 2013. six of those violations, which occurred between 1996 and 2004, concerned either the possession of drug paraphernalia, controlled substances, or inmate-manufactured alcohol. two violations involved the threat or risk of violencein 2003, banuelos was found guilty of 2 after being released on parole in 1986, banuelos suffered a number of other convictions before receiving his ons either involved taking a vehicle without consent (veh. code,  10851, subd. (a)) or a drug-related crime (health & saf. code,  11350, subd. (a), 11550, subd. (a)). 5 conspiracy to commit battery on an inmate who owed him money; and in 2010, he pleaded guilty to possession of a deadly weapon (a razor blade). in 2007, banuelos pleaded guilty to refusing a direct order. finally, on two separate occasionsfirst in 2011 and again in 2013banuelos pleaded guilty to participating in a hunger strike while (shu). in addition, the people introduced evidence showing that prison officials had determined in 2007 and again in 2012 that banuelos was an active associate of the mexican mafia prison gang. finally, the people offered evidence regarding s as determined by the california department of corrections and rehabilitation (cdcr). unhe lower an security risk and the more access an inmate has to programs and work opportunities. score for serious rules violations. an inmate can lower his or her score by not violating the rules for extended periods and by performing well in work, school, or vocational training. a score of 19 is the lowest an inmate can receive. as a life inmate, banuelos would have a mandatory minimum score of 52. between 1994 and 2014,banueloslassification score never fell below 60 and his june 2014 score was 104, which, at the time, was his highest score to date. 6 banuelos through the expert testimony of richard subia (subia), a public safety consultant, who previously worked for the cdcr for 27 years, rising up from a correctional officer to acting director of the department. subia opined that public safety if he were resentenced as a se on several facts. first, while banuelos may be affiliated with the mexican mafia prison banuelos had been stabbed several times in prison for drug debts, something that would not happen to a gang leader or indeed, subia opined that, given his drug habit, banuelos had to be affiliated with the gang in order to secure access to illegal drugs. second, banuelos had not been accused of any violent behavior since 2003 and, with the possible exception of the hunger strikes, banuelos had not participated in any gang behavior while in prison; -wide shu hunger strikes should be seen as an act of self-preservation, as he would have been in danger had he not participated. moreover, banuelos had been approved for a double cell, which indicated that prison officials did not third, while subia conceded that se both before and after being sent to prison, there was ha[d] any current 7 in fact, the last drug-related decade ago.3 on may 21, 2105, in a written memorandum, the court denied the petition, finding that the preponderance of the evidence demonstrated that banuelos poses an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. the trial court identified three principal reasons for denying the petition. first, there was the criminal history and substance abuse problems. as the court the court noted that banuelos never completed probation or parole successfully and his criminal history is that of [ ], who commits property crimes to support his of court rules violations] involve drugs or alcohol or drug involvement in and/or affiliation with spite his long incarceration, banuelos never 3 the people did present a rebuttal witness, a los signed to the prison gang unit, however the trial court found the testimony of this knowledge of banuelos. 8 recently as 2012, prison staff discovered a birthday card sent to [banuelos] from a fellow mexican mafia gang member with symbols showing allegiance to the gang. . . . [banuelos] third, the court found it quite concerning that despite information in the record that [banuelos] actually engaged while in prison indication at all that [banuelos] will receive drug counseling, accountability or has in effect any relaps iii. the motion on june 5, 2015, banuelos filed his motion for reconsideration. the motion focused most centrally on the -entry plan. ved it was irrelevant to present evidence of a re-entry plan after the court allegedly stated in a tentative ruling in may 2014almost a full year before the suitability hearingthat if banuelos was released from jail, he would have to spend a year in a live-in counsel augmented the motion by submitting, inter alia, a letter from cri help accepting banuelos into its residential drug treatment program. on july 17, 2105, in a written decision the trial court denied the motion. the decision emphasized that the counsel from presenting evidence as to permanent housing, 9 prevention of future drug addiction (which is often a lifelong battle) and family support after leaving transitional presented testimony [regarding a post-release drug program] . . . decision as re-entry plans are only relevant if [banuelos] was first not found to pose an unreasonable risk of danger to on august 6, 2015, banuelos filed a timely notice of appeal challenging the denial of the petition and the motion. discussion i. nable risk proposition 36 a. rules for the interpretation of voter initiatives the first issue raised by banuelos requires us to interpret proposition 36 and proposition 47. interpreting a voter initiative . . . we apply the same principles that govern statutory construction.

(people v. birkett (1992) 21 cal.4th 226, 231.) furthermore, although courts may not language, a word that has been erroneously used may be subject to judicial correction in order to best carry out the intent of the adopting body.

(e)(2)(c)(iv).) 14 definition of applies to a proposition 36 resentencing petition, have reached different opinions on this matter, and that the issue is currently pending before our supreme court.6 for the reasons that follow, we conclude that the voters error is properly subjected to judicial correction. specifically, as we now discuss, we believe the voters intended in section 1170.18, subdivision (c) to refer to proposition 47, not to the entire penal code. we therefore conclude that the passage of proposition 47 did not alter proposition 36 or section 1170.126. first, proposition 47 itself. for example, subdivision (n) states: is and related sections is intended to diminish 6 see, e.g., people v. valencia (2014) 232 cal.app.4th 514, review granted february 18, 2015, s223825 definition does not apply to prop. 36 petitions]; people v. florez (2016) 245 cal.app.4th 1176, review granted june 8, 2016, s234168 [same]; people v. myers (2016) 245 cal.app.4th 794, review granted may 25, 2016, s233937 [same]; people v. lopez (2015) 236 cal.app.4th 518, review granted july 15, 2015, s227028 [same]; people v. cordova (2016) 248 cal.app.4th 543, review granted august 31, 2016, s236179 does apply to prop. 36 petitions].) 15 or abrogate the finality of judgments in any case not falling within the purview of this act ( 1170.18, subd. (n), italics added.) however, if a court evaluating a proposition 36 petition must grant that petition unless it finds a unreasonable risk that a defendant will commit a super strike (rather than a risk of danger to public safety more similarly, the wording of section 1170.18, subdivision (c) is also inconsistent with an intent to apply that subdivision throughout the entire penal code. throughout proposition 47 to refer to persons petitioning (see  1170.18, subds. (a), (b), (c), (j), (1), (m).) individuals petitioning under that particular act. ( 1170.18, subd. (c).) second, the official title and summary, legal analysis, and arguments for and against proposition 47 nowhere suggest that proposition 47 will have an impact on proposition 36. (see voter information guide, gen. elec. (nov. 4, 2014) prop. 47 (voter information guide), <http://vigarchive.sos.ca.gov/2014/general/en/propositions/47/> (as of october 28, 2016.) the ballot materials do not, for example, say that proposition 47 will severely restrict the ability of courts to reject resentencing petitions under proposition 36. neither the text of proposition 47 nor its 16 ballot materials say anything about proposition 36 or about exportiresentencing schemes. ( 1170.18; voter information guide, passim; see generally people v. mosley (2015) 60 cal.4th 1044, 1073 [looking to ballot summaries and arguments in although proposition 47 and are similar in structure and contain similar remedial resentencing provisionspeople v. rouse (2016) 245 cal.app.4th 292, 298; people v. rivascolon (2015) 241 cal.app.4th 444, 452, fn. 4), they have different goals and purposes. proposition 47 is designed to give lower-level , nonviolent crimes like petty theft and drug possessionsentence. (voter information guide, text of prop. 47,  3, subd. (3), at p. 70.) proposition 36, in contrast, is designed to give hardened criminals with at least two prior serious or violent convictions a reduced sentence on their third felony (from 25 to life down to double the usual sentence). ( 1170.126, subd. (f).) const(voter information guide, text of prop. 47,  18, at p. 74.) third, the timing of proposition 47 is inconsistent with an intent to affect proposition 36 petitions. proposition 36 required defendants to file petitions within two years from its enactment absent a showing of good cause for a late petition. ( 1170.126, subd. (b).) proposition 47 was enacted with only two days remaining in the two-year period for 17 filing proposition 36 petitions. a rational voter would not have understood proposition 47 to change the rules for proposition 36 petitions when the period for filing such petitions had almost expired unless there was some explanatory reference to proposition 36. the ballot materials for proposition 47 contain no such reference to proposition 36. (voter information guide, passim.) on these grounds, we conclude that section 1170.18, subdivision (c) contains a drafting errorthe use of the word correctedroposition 36. accordingly, we hold that the trial court did not rely upon an incorrect definition of that term. ii. the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that banuelos posed risk of danger to public safety a. standard of review section 1170.126 provides that the trial court must exercise its discretion to determine whether a petitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. ( 1170.126, subd. (f).) . . . a discretionary power is statutorily vested in the trial court, its exercise of that except on a showing that the court exercised its discretion in an arbitrary, capricious or patently absurd manner that resulted (people v. rodrigues (1994) 8 cal.4th 1060, 11241125.) 18 does not abuse its discretion unless its decision is so irrational or arbitrary that no reasonable person could agree (people v. carmony (2004) 33 cal.4th 367, 377.) b. no abuse of discretion in denying the petition in its detailed memorandum of decision, the trial court considered each of the three categories of evidence outlined in proposition 36;7 weighed them; and ultimately concluded that criminal history, disciplinary history, continued gang affiliation, and absence of re-entry plan meant that banuelos posed an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. accordingly, we hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the petition. iii. the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion motions for reconsideration must be (code civ. proc.,  1008, subd. (a)(b).) an abuse of discretion standard applies denial of a motion for reconsideration.(hudson v. county of los angeles (2014) 232 cal.app.4th 392, 408.) banuelos argues that the trial court abused its discretion -open the matter to allow the 7 those three categories are as follows: would result in an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. ( 1170.126, subd. (g).) 19 introduction of evidence of a re-argument misses the point. there was no need to reconsider the ppetition admission into a resident treatment program, because there was sufficient disciplinary history, cdcr risk scores, and continued gang resentencing posed an unreasonable risk to public safety without considering the existence of a treatment program. testimony [regarding a post-release drug program] . . . this reentry plans are only relevant if [banuelos] was first not found to pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public motion, banuelos did not offer any new facts or circumstances other than those related to his admission into the cri help residential treatment program. because there were sufficient facts for the trial court to find that banuelos posed an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety without considering the cri help admission, and because banuelos did not offer evidence regarding any other new facts or circumstances on the risks posed to public safety from his resentencing, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion. moreover, the party moving for reconsideration must provide a satisfactory explanation for the failure to produce the new or different facts at an earlier time. (shiffer v. cbs corporation ( 2015) 240 cal.app.4th 246, 255.) here, as the 20 trial court noted in its decision, there was no satisfactory explanation offered for why evidence of admission into a residential treatment program, such as that offered by cri help, was not offered at the hearing on the petition: the purported tentative ruling, which was made one year prior not absolve counsel from presenting evidence [at the suitability hearing] as to permanent housing, prevention of future drug addiction (which is often a lifelong battle) and under these circumstances, we hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion. iv. banueis premature a. standard of review to prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, defendant must establish her representation fell below professional standards of reasonableness and must affirmatively establish prejudice. (strickland v. washington (1984) 466 u.s. 668, 687; people v. hart (1999) 20 cal.4th 546, 623showing is insufficient as to one component of this claim, we need not address the other.

[p]erhaps he did have a reason, of which defense counsel was aware, some other reason not to suppress the evibidone gave [the deputy] the opportunity to point to any specific and articulable facts justifying his actions. nor did the 22 prosecution have the opportunity to offer some other possible ibid.) the lesson from mendoza tello, supra, 15 cal.4th 264, be truly confident all the relevant facts have been id. at p. 267.) or, as the court in people v. hinds, supra, 108 cal.app.4th adjudicating claims casting aspersions on counsel when counsel is not in a position to defend his conduct. a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel instead is more id. at p. 902.) b. the record is too undeveloped to support direct appellate review here, we decline to review banuelos ineffectiveness of counsel claim because the record does not contain a full out a satisfactory one. banuelos -believing such planning to be irrelevant as appellant would be spending a year in a drug program upon and/if however, it is unclear from the record before us whether banuelosh for a treatment program. on may 16, 2014, after the tentative ruling, banuelosnt a letter to 23 live in drug program for one year. there may be some good out of that, since it is obvious that all of you [sic] felony matters arose from a drug problem. i am going to find a program for you, as close to culver city as possible8 (italics added.) based on this letter, it appears that banueloscounsel, far from abandoning the search for a treatment program, was committing himself to carrying out such a search, thus raising the possibility that no evidence of a suitable program was introduced at the hearing on the petition because, at that time, his counsel had not been able to find and/or secure banuelosadmission into a suitable program. as a result, what is missing from the record is evidence about what counsel did and did not do following the may 2014 tentative ruling. typically motivated by considerations not reflected in the record. it is for this reason that writ review of claims of ineffective assistance of counsel is the preferred review evidence of the standard of legal practice in the community as to a specific tactic, can be presented by declarations or 8 in the declaration that he submitted in support of the sed two other programs besides cri help, but it is unclear from the declaration whether his counsel acquired his information about these programs as a result of the search he promised to undertake for his client in may 2014 or as a result of something else. 24 in re arturo a.
