(b)(1)),1 and intentionally killed elsie molina by means of lying in wait ( 190.2, subd. (a)(15)). soto pleaded not guilty and denied the special allegations. 2. the trial according to the evidence at trial, in 2002 molina became romantically involved with soto, a married man with children. molina and soto had two daughters together. in 2006 soto moved to texas with his wife and children but continued his relationship with molina. in april 2007 soto asked molina to move to texas to be near him. she ultimately declined and terminated the relationship. soto told molina during a telephone call following their break- portion of the truck she drove for her work. a deputy medical examiner with the los right carotid artery and right jugular vein. she had also suffered blunt force trauma to the 1 statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise indicated. 3 head and right eye. police officers found a knife in a storm drain near the scene. soto initially told law enforcement investigators he had been in texas on october 11, 2007 and had not travelled to los angeles. however, his travel agent testified soto had purchased a roundtrip ticket from san antonio to los angeles on october used on october 11, 2007 in los angeles near the murder scene to call molina several times. video surveillance recordings at los angeles international airport showed a man identified as soto arriving in los angeles on his scheduled flight from san antonio. video surveillance from a sporting goods store in carson showed the same man purchasing a knife identical to that identified as the murder weapon, along with a rope, a five-pound dumbbell and a day pack. soto testified in his own defense, explaining he had come to los angeles on october 11, arrange to see his daughters, but molina refused to talk to him that evening, telling him to call her back the following day. rather than wait another day, soto decided to return to texas the next morning. soto acknowledged he had initially told detectives he had been in texas on october 11, 2007. he had lied because he feared he would be wrongfully er of the surveillance video recordings. he also denied having threatened molina or killed her. 3. the verdict and sentence the jury found soto guilty of murder and found true the special allegations he had committed the murder by means of lying in wait and had used a dangerous weapon. molina was sentenced to an aggregate state prison term of 26 years to life, 25 years to life for the first degree murder plus a one-year consecutive term for the dangerous weapon enhancement. in addition, the court ordered soto to pay a $10,000 restitution fine ( 1202.4, subd. (b)); $7,473.63 (plus interest) in victim restitution ( 1202.4, subd. (f)); a $40 court security assessment ( 1455.8, subd. (a)(1)); a $30 criminal conviction 4 assessment (gov. code,  70373); and a $20 dna fee (gov. code,  76104.7). based on home in california and did not need molina to pay him back the thousands of dollars he had given to her to help her, the court also ordered soto to pay $8,719 in attorney fees in connection with his court- 987.8). discussion 1. the failure to instruct the jury with calcrim no. 302 did not constitute prejudicial error soto contends his trial testimony created a conflict in the evidence as to whether he was the person in the video surveillance recordings and, as a result, the court erred in determine there is a conflict in the evidence, you must decide what evidence, if any, to believe. do not simply count the number of witnesses who agree or disagree on a point and accept the testimony of the greater number of witnesses. on the other hand, do not disregard the testimony of any witness without a reason or because of prejudice or a desire to favor one side or the other. what is important is whether the testimony or any other evidence convinces you, not just the number of witnesses who testify about a ce the supreme court has held the trial court has a sua sponte duty to give such an instruction when conflicting evidence has been presented at trial. (see people v. virgil (2011) 51 cal.4th 1210, 1261-1262 (virgil instruct jury with caljic no. 2.22, the predecessor to calcrim no. 302, was error in light of conflicting evidence presented at trial]; accord, people v. cleveland (2004) 32 cal.4th 704, 751; people v. rincon-pineda (1975) 14 cal.3d 864, 884-885.) however, the failure to give the instruction can be harmless error. (virgil, at p. 1262.) in virgil, supra, 51 cal.4th 1210, the jury was presented with conflicting although the defendant did not request caljic no. 2.22 (or an equivalent instruction) be given, the court held the trial court had a sua sponte duty to instruct the jury on 5 evaluating conflicting evidence. (virgil, at pp. 1261-1262.) nonetheless, the court held the failure to give the instruction was harmless error because the jury had received sufficient guidance from other instructions and the prosecutor did not suggest guilt could be determined by comparing the number of witnesses presented by each side:2 onsidering the instructions as a whole, we are satisfied the jury received ample guidance on how to evaluate conflicting testimony. [citation.] the prosecutor did not witnesses presented by each side, and there is no evidence the absence of caljic no. reasonably probable that the jury would have reached a different result had caljic no. 2.22 been gi(virgil, at p. 1262.) as soto acknowledges, his jury received the same or similar instructions as those held by the court in virgil as providing sufficient guidance on evaluating conflicting testimony, in an effort to distinguish virgil, therefore, soto cites various portions of the record to suggest the prosecutor in the instant case, unlike in virgil, emphasized the disparity in the number of witnesses presented by the prosecution and the defense. the prosecutor here did nothing of the sort. rather, the prosecutor simply reviewed the substance of each 2 the virgil evidenceno. no. evidencer consistent or inconsistent statements virgil, supra, 51 cal.4th at p. 1262.) 6 and inconsistencies in his description of events. at no time did the prosecutor highlight, emphasize or even mention the disparity in the number of witnesses offered by each side. in sum, considering the other instructions given and the arguments by counsel at trial, any error in failing to instruct with calcrim no. 302 was harmless. (see virgil, supra, 51 cal.4th at p. 1262; people v. watson (1956) 46 cal.2d 818, 836.) 2. soto has forfeited his challenge to the restitution order soto challenges the amount of victim restitution awarded, claiming the $7,473.63 evidence. although he failed to object in the trial court, he asserts his argument is cognizable on appeal because, as framed, his argument is one of sufficiency of the people v. brasure (2008) 42 cal.4th 1037, 1075 (brasureclaim that the [restitution] order was merely unwarranted by the evidence, as distinct from being unauthorized by statute. [citation.] as the order for restitution was within amount of the order nor requested a hearing to determine it [citation], we do not decide whether the court abused its discretion in determinipeople v. gibson (1994) 27 cal.app.4th 1466, 1468-1469 [considerations of fairness and orderly and efficient administration of law warrant application of the forfeiture doctrine to bar substantial evidence challenge to amount of restitution fine].) 3. order; his challenge based on the absence of findings on ability to pay is without merit 19 as reimbursement for his court-hear or consider evidence as to his actual ability to pay and, in any event, the evidence is insufficient to support the amount ordered. (see  987.8, subd. ( 7 which a defendant is provided legal assistance, either through the public defender or private counsel appointed by the court, upon conclusion of the criminal proceedings in the trial court . . . the court may, after notice and a hearing, make a determination of the a. soto has forfeited any challenge to the lack of notice and a hearing soto limits his appellate argument to challenging the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the amount of the reimbursement order and his ability to pay. he does not argue he was deprived of notice and a hearing on reimbursement. in any event, because soto did not object in the trial court, that argument would be forfeited. (in re s.b. (2004) 32 cal.4th 1287, 1293; in re wilford j. (2005) 131 cal.app.4th 742, 753-754 [objection on notice grounds forfeited]; see generally people v. williams (1997) 16 cal.4th 153, 250 [constitutional objections not properly raised are forfeited].) b. soto has forfeited any challenge to the amount of the attorney fee order the appellate courts have disagreed whether the failure to raise an objection to the amount of the reimbursement order in the trial court results in a forfeiture on appeal. (compare people v. mcmahan (1992) 3 cal.app.4th 740, 750 [failure to object to attorney fee order under  987.8 in trial court results in forfeiture of issue on appeal] with people v. viray (2005) 134 cal.app.4th 1186, 1215 (viray believe that an appellate forfeiture can properly be predicated on the failure of a trial attorney to challenge an order concerning his own fees in refusing to apply the forfeiture doctrine in these circumstances, our colleagues in the sixth district emphasized the inherent conflict of interest that exists when, at the taking is burdened with a patent conflict of interest and cannot be relied upon to vicariously be can hardly be relied on to contest an order when a successful contest will directly harm 8 the interests of the person or entity who hired him and to whom he presumptively looks viray, supra, 134 cal.app.4th at pp. 1215-1216.) significantly, the viray where the defendant has engaged independent counsel before reimbursement is ordered. [citation.] such a case would be governed by the usual principles concerning id. at p. 1216, fn. 15.) december 3, under section 987.8. thus, the viray analysis does not preclude forfeiture here. (see generally people v. saunders (1993) 5 more famil other courts have refused to find forfeiture on the ground a challenge to the amount of the reimbursement order is a sufficiency of the evidence issue, which may be raised for the first time on appeal. (see people v. lopez (2005) 129 cal.app.4th 1508, 1537 [question whether  ability to pay may be raised for first time on appeal]; people v. pacheco (2010) 187 cal.app.4th 1392, 1397 [same].) we find no meaningful distinction between a challenge to the amount of a restitution order, which is forfeited if not raised in the trial court (see brasure, supra, 42 cal.4th at p. 1075), and a challenge to the amount of an attorney fee reimbursement order under section 987.8. as the supreme court recognized in brasure, virtually any challenge to a fee imposed at sentencing without objection can be framed on appeal as one of sufficiency of the evidence. mere characterization of the argument as one of sufficiency of the evidence does not alter the proper application of forfeiture in these circumstances. (see brasure, at p. 1075.) 9 c. soto also contends there was insufficient evidence as to his ability to pay. (see  987.8.) the supreme court has not yet ruled whether a challenge to the sufficiency of 3 we need not decide whether this question is materially different from a challenge to the amount of a restitution order in the forfeiture context. even if forfeiture is inapplicable in these circumstances, the argument fails on its merits because the evidence was sufficient -to-pay finding. soto testified at trial he had made a $200,000 profit on the sale of his los angeles home in 2006, just before moving to texas. soto offered no objection and no evidence rebutting his trial testimony on that point when the court relied on it in issuing the reimbursement order. on this record, thus, the reimbursement order. 4. the judgment is modified to strike the dna penalty assessment the government code includes two statutes authorizing imposition of dna penalties: government code section 76104.6, subdivision (a), initially adopted as proposition 69 at the november 2, 2004 general election and later amended, requires every fine, penalty, or forfeiture imposed and collected by the courts for all criminal - imposed and collected by the courts for all criminal offenses. by its terms, the o the 3 a similar question whether a defendant forfeited a claim of inability to pay a government code section 29550.2 jail booking fee by failing to object to imposition of the fee at his sentencing hearing is currently pending before the supreme court. (see people v. mccullough (2011) 193 cal.app.4th 864, review granted june 29, 2011, s192513.) 10 penalty levied pursuant to [] 76104.6, there shall be levied an additional state-only ; people v. valencia (2008) 166 cal.app.4th 1392, 1396 [ 76104.7 penalty may only be imposed when  at sentencing the trial court imposed, among other fines, a $20 dna penalty pursuant to government code section 76104.7, subdivision (a). acknowledging that the government code section 76104.6 penalty, the people urge this court to remand the issue to the trial court, arguing that, despicode section 76104.7 as the authorizing statute, the court did not identify the statute on the record. accordingly, the people urge, clarification is needed as to which statute the court used to impose the dna penalty. however, remand for clarification is unnecessary because the ruling is improper under either statute. the dna penalty authorized in government code sections 76014.6 and 76104.7 may not be imposed on a restitution fine (gov. code,  76104.6, subd. (a)(3)(a) & 76104.7, subd. (c)(1)), a court security assessment ( 1465.8, subd. (b); people v. valencia, supra, 166 cal.app.4th at p. 1396) or a criminal conviction assessment (gov. code,  70373, subd. (b)). thus, the dna penalty could not have been lawfully imposed on any of the fines or assessments ordered in this case. accordingly, we modify the sentence to strike the $20 dna penalty assessment. (see generally people v. scott (1994) 9 cal.4th 331, 354 [appellate court may modify unauthorize 11 disposition the judgment is modified to strike the $20 dna penalty assessment. as modified, the judgment is affirmed. the superior court is directed to prepare a corrected abstract of judgment and to forward it to the department of corrections and rehabilitation. perluss, p. j. we concur: zelon, j. jackson, j.
