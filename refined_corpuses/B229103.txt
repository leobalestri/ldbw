[citations.] at the same time, the united states supreme court has held that because the sixth amendment grants to the accused personally the right to present a defense, a defendant possesses the right to represented by counsel, the right of self-representation is not self-executing. in faretta, . . . the court held that a knowing, voluntary, and unequivocal assertion of the right of self-representation, made weeks before trial by a competent, literate defendant, should have been recognized [citation]; subsequent decisions of lower courts have required expressly that the defendant make a timely and unequivocal assertion of the right of self-people v. marshall (1997) 15 cal.4th 1, 20-21.) unequivocal. faretta motions made on the eve of trial are routinely held to be untimely. (see people v. valdez (2004) 32 cal.4th 73, 102 [motion for self-representation made people v. clark (1992) 3 cal.4th 41, 99 [faretta request made during 10-day trailing period was, in effect, made on eve of trial and, therefore, was untimely]; people v. burton (1989) 48 cal.3d 843, 853 [faretta had answered ready, and the case had been transferred to a trial department for pretrial motions and jury people v. rudd (1998) 63 cal.app.4th 620, 626 -representation made on the day preceding or on the trial date have been considered 5 -representation is not made in a timely fashion prior to trial, self-people v. jenkins exercising that discretion, a trial court is required to consider (1) representation, (2) the reasons for the request, (4) the length and stage of the proceedings, and (5) the disruption or delay which might reasonably be expected to follow the granting of such a motion. (people v. windham (1977) 19 cal.3d 121, 128 . . . people v. scott (2001) 91 cal.app.4th 1197, 1204.) a trial court need not, however, explicitly consider the windham factors on the record. (see id. at p. 1206 [considered each of the windham factors, there were sufficient reasons on the record to constitute an implpeople v. perez (1992) 4 windham] inquiry, we conclude there were sufficient reasons on the record for the court to exercise its discretion to deny t -representation ances confronting the people v. howze (2001) 85 cal.app.4th 1380, 1397-1398.) b. discussion. ayree sought to represent himself on the morning jury selection was set to begin; he was not ready to go to trial and would have needed a continuance. under these faretta motion was certainly untimely. in addition, it was not unequivocal because ayree only made the motion after announcing he was trying to retain new counsel and the trial court indicated it would not grant a continuance for that -representation may suppo6 (people v. marshall, supra, 15 cal.4th at p. 23 [motion for self-representation made in frustration may be denied].) -representation. 3. marsden motion was properly denied. ayree contends the trial court violated people v. marsden (1970) 2 cal.3d 118, by denying his request to substitute appointed counsel. this claim is meritless. a. legal principles. another attorney, and asserts inadequate representation, the trial court must permit the defendant to explain the basis of his contention and to relate specific instances of the attorecord clearly shows that the first appointed attorney is not providing adequate representation [citation] or that defendant and counsel have become embroiled in such an the decision whether to grant a requested substitution is within the discretion of the trial court; appellate courts will not find an abuse of that discretion unless the failure to people v. vines (2011) 51 cal.4th 830, 878.) marsden hearing is not a full-blown adversarial proceeding, but an informal hearing in which the court ascertains the nature of the whether the allegations have sufficient supeople v. gutierrez (2009) 45 cal.4th 789, 803.) a bare assertion of inadequate representation is insufficient to require appointment of new counsel; the defendant must make a substantial showing. (people v. crandell (1988) 46 cal.3d 833, 859, disapproved on other grounds by people v. crayton (2002) 28 7 with, an appointed attorney were sufficient to compel appointment of substitute counsel, defendants effectively would have a veto power over any appointment and by a process of elimination could obtain appointment of their preferred attorneys, which is certainly people v. memro we do not find marsden people v. dickey (2005) 35 cal.4th 884, 922.) marsden motion for abuse of discretion.
