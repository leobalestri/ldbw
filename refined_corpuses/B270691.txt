(people v. gomez (june 23, 2015, b251303) [nonpub. opn.] [gomez i].) on remand the trial court held a resentencing hearing at which counsel for the people and garcia were present, but garcia was not. garcia contends the trial court violated his constitutional and statutory rights to be present at the resentencing hearing and abused its discretion in denying his motion for a continuance of the hearing. we reverse and remand again for resentencing. factual and procedural background 1. a jury convicted garcia on counts 1 through 4 and 6 through 8. the jury also found true as to counts 1 through 7 that the offenses had been committed for the benefit of a criminal street gang and as to counts 1 through 4 that each defendant had personally used and discharged a firearm causing great bodily injury or death and/or a principal personally used and intentionally discharged a firearm causing great bodily injury or 1 only. 3 death. in addition garcia admitted the truth of a special allegation he had served a prior prison term for a felony within the meaning of penal code section 667.5, subdivision (b);2 however that special allegation was dismissed in furtherance of justice. the trial court sentenced garcia to an aggregate indeterminate state prison term of 160 years to life: (i) 25 years to life on count 1, plus 25 years to life for the firearm enhancement; (ii) a consecutive term of 15 years to life on count 2, plus 25 years to life for the firearm enhancement; (iii) a consecutive term of 25 years to life on count 3, plus 10 years for the gang enhancement; (iv) a consecutive term of 25 years to life on count 4, plus 10 years for the gang enhancement; (v) a concurrent upper term of three years on count 6, plus four years for the gang enhancement; (vi) a stayed upper term of three years on count 7, plus four years for the gang enhancement; and a concurrent upper term of three years on count 8. 2. appeal and remand garcia and his codefendants appealed, contending, in part, the conviction on count 1 for first degree murder was improper because the jury had been instructed on the natural and probable consequences theory of aiding and abetting, which the supreme court subsequently held could not be a basis for that offense. (people v. chiu (2014) 59 cal.4th 155.) garcia and his codefendants also argued the conviction on count 7 (shooting a firearm with gross negligence) must be reversed because that offense was a lesser included offense of counts 3 and 4 (shooting 2 statutory references are to this code. 4 at an inhabited dwelling). we agreed with those arguments and reversed the convictions on counts 1 and 7. on count 1 we directed the people to either accept a reduction of the convictions to second degree murder or to retry the defendants under direct perpetrator or direct aiding and abetting theories. in light of our reversal of counts 1 and 7, we vacated the sentences of the defendants in their entirety and remanded for resentencing after the people either retried count 1 or elected to reduce the convictions to second degree murder. to assist the trial court at resentencing, we addressed several sentencing errors in the original sentences. on counts 3 and 8 we held the sentences must be stayed pursuant to section 654 because the same act or series of acts was the basis for other convictions. on count 4 we held the sentences of 35 years to life had been incorrectly calculated. the proper sentences were 40 years to life: 15 years to life under section 186.22, subdivision (b)(4)(b), as the alternate base term for a section 246 offense, plus 25 years to life for the firearm enhancement under section 12022.53, subdivisions (d) and (e)(2). the remittitur issued on october 21, 2015. on january 19, 2016, after receiving the remittitur, the trial court conducted a hearing at which counsel for the people and garcia appeared. garcia, who was in custody, was not pfiled a motion the same day as the hearing, requesting a continuance so he could have additional time to prepare a motion for a new trial and to prepare for resentencing. the trial court heard argument on the motion, during which stated he was not given advance notice of what proceedings would be conducted at the january 19th hearing. defense counsel requested garcia be present for the resentencing and he 5 be given adequate time to address the issues raised in our decision. and the request to be present at resentencing. the trial court stated it the the people stipulated to reduce count 1 to second degree murder; the sentence on that count was modified to 15 years to life, plus 25 years to life for the firearm enhancement. the court corrected the sentencing errors identified in our opinion and otherwise upheld the same terms as in its original decision, resulting in an aggregate indeterminate state prison term of 120 years to life. discussion 1. a resentencing hearing in the presence of garcia was required has a constitutional right to be present at all critical stages of tall stages of the trial where his absence might frustrate the fairness of the proceedingswhenever his presence has a relation, reasonably substantial, to the fullness of his opportunity to defend against the charge (people v. rodriguez (1998) 17 cal.4th 253, 260.) this constitutional right to be present extends to sentencing proceedings (people v. sanchez (2016) 245 cal.app.4th 1409, 1414) and, in certain circumstances, to 6 resentencing proceedings (people v. rouse (2016) 245 cal.app.4th 292, 300; people v. arbee (1983) 143 cal.app.3d 351, 356). in addition, defendants have a statutory right to be present at sentencing. (see  977, subd. felony is charged, the accused shall be personally present at the . . . 3 in light of these well-established principles, garcia contends he was entitled to be present at the hearing after receipt of the remittitur at which the new sentence was pronounced. in response the people assert our disposition in the prior appeal merely directed the trial court to impose a new sentence on count 1 after reduction of that conviction to second degree murder and to correct the errors discussed in our opinion. a ministerial sentence reduction, it [was] not a critical stage of in support of their position the people rely primarily on united states v. jackson (11th cir. 1991) 923 f.2d 1494, in which the eleventh circuit held defendant had no right to be present at (id. at p. 1497; cf. hall v. moore (11th cir. 2001) 253 f.3d 624, 627 [stating no right to counsel exists at resentencing hearing 3 or her right to be present at a critical stage of the trial, provided the waiver is knowing, people v. cunningham (2015) 61 cal.4th 609, 633; see also  977, subd. (b).) there is no evidence in the record, and the people do not contend, garcia waived his right to be present at the resentencing hearing. 7 jackson the defendant had originally been sentenced pursuant to the penalty prescribed by statute at the time of his conviction; however, the trial court later reduced his sentence to the statutory penalty in effect at the time the acts were committed. the eleventh cirthe resentencing hearing because is not a critical stage of the proceedings . . . . we, therefore, hold that, where the entire sentencing package has not been set aside, a correction of an illegal sentence does not constitute a resentencing requiring the presence of the defendant, so long as (jackson, at p. 1497.) the exception t sentencing articulated in jackson does not apply in this case because ministerial ceremony. sentences in their entirety and remand[ed] for resentencingand gomez i, supra, at pp. 2, 34.) the trial court, therefore, had jurisdiction to reconsider the related to convictions affirmed on appeal. (people v. rosas (2010) 191 cal.app.4th 107, 118; see people v. burbine (2003) 106 we endorse the notion that trial courts are, and should be, afforded discretion by rule and statute to reconsider an entire sentencing structure in multicount cases where a portion of the original verdict and resulting sentence has people v. hill (1986) 185 resentencing by an appellate court, the trial court is entitled to 8 consider the entire sentencing scheme. not limited to merely striking illegal portions, the trial court may reconsider all this rule is justified because an aggregate prison term is not a series of separate independent terms, but one term made up of interdependent components. the invalidity of one compohill, at p. 834; accord, burbine, at p. 1257 felony sentence for a multiple-comprises an integrated whole entire sentence, including reconsideration of any aggravating factors in light of the reduction of count 1 to second degree murder or any other evidence garcia wished to submit in favor of lower or concurrent sentences, garcia, with his counsel, had a right to be present for the resentencing.
