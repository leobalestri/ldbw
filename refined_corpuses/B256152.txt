(stats.2010, ch. 711 (s.b.1080),  4 [repealed]; stats. 2010, ch. 711 (s.b.1080),  6 [reenacted].) 4 facts 1. prior robbery conviction and ang backgrounds montes and lerma were both members of the pico nuevo criminal street gang.3 caldera belonged to whittier varrio locos, a pico nuevo. the three had been friends growing up, and montes and caldera were best friends. he was convicted of the robbery of two gigante market customers in pico rivera. montes was questioned during the robbery investigation and told police that she had gone to gigante market with lerma to use an atm. in the store were two men, one of whom was african-american. lerma asked montes, know this is pico nuevo? lerma then approached the men and repeated his question, but montes did not see him rob anyone. lerma was ultimately convicted of the robbery and sentenced to eight years in prison. rat. the letter was never recovered. montes never saw him again. in early may 2011, while lerma was on parole for the robbery, he paid a visit to jose trejo, a pico nuevo shot-caller in charge of about 100 other gang members.4 visiting trejo was an opportunity for lerma to make a case to gang leadership that despite his lengthy incarceration, he could still be valuable to pico nuevo. shooting montes in front of trejo would be another way for lerma to reestablish power in the gang and prove that he could be an asset. 3 montes and lerma were also known by their gang monikers. montes used the - 4 a shot-caller is a mid-level gang leader who directs younger members of the gang and authorizes their illegal activities. 5 2. the knights inn party the evening of may 18, 2011, someone rented a small motel room at the knights inn to use as the a gathering at which gang members and their friends assembled to take drugs together. each of the eight to 15 party guests was connected in some way to pico nuevo. for example, trejo was a shot-callermid-level gang leader, tish sanchez had a son in the gang, lerma was on parole for a pico nuevo crime, and caldera belonged to an allied gang -- the whittier varrio locos. sanchez and caldera arrived first. white nissan altima, which sported fancy rims. trejo was dropped off by some friends. most of the people in the room were strangers to trejo, though he later identified caldera and lerma. all of the party guests smoked methamphetamine that evening; others, such as trejo, also drank alcohol and smoked marijuana. during the party, caldera and lerma were seen talking to each othereither secretively or romantically. at some point, sanchez saw caldera holding a cloth gun case. eventually, trejo grew restless and began looking for a ride to another party; sanchez rejected this plantrust caldera with her carbut ultimately agreed to let lerma borrow it for 15 minutes to pick up his girlfriend. she left the key on the counter for him. 3. the shooting and aftermath just after 1:00 a.m., lerma and caldera left the knights inn with trejo. caldera lerma rode in the front passenger seat, and trejo sat in the back. unbeknownst to them, had placed a gps the week before as part of an investigation into her activities. she retrieved a cloth-wrapped item from beneath her seat and handed it to lerma. they did not speak to each other over the loud music, but lerma put the item in his pocket. 6 lerma and trejo got out of the car and walked down a nearby alleyapartment. montes shared her small bedroom with vicky gollette, who is partially blind. the women slept in separate twin beds. the bedroom window faced the alley, and montes kept it open to the night air. montes slept beside the window, and gollette slept next to the door. the men lerma looked inside while trejo stood nearby. lerma called-screen. as soon as the sleeping montes mumbled a response, lerma shot her in the head. then he paused, fiddled with the gun, and fired two or three more shots. trejo took off running. lerma caught up to him at a chain-link fence, and told him if he did not [his] lerma would [him] after delivering this warning, lerma ran back to the waiting car. caldera and lerma drove off in the nissan at 1:10 a.m. 911. emergency dispatch began receiving calls at 1:11 a.m., and deputies arrived within minutes. they found montes in her bedroom, laying on her bed. she had been shot in the right temple, but was moving slightly and making a gurgling noise. the forensic evidence supported the witness accounts. police found holes in the screen, blinds, and wall, and a spent bullet in the neighboring apartment; the trajectory of the bullets established that they were fired through the bedroom window and down towards the bed. though the gun used in the shooting was never recovered, criminalist manuel munoz testified the bullets were fired from the same weaponprobably a .38 special, or a .357 magnum revolver, based on the spent bullets and bullet fragments recovered from the scene, and lack of shell casings. the record does not reveal where the nissan went, or what lerma and caldera did, for the hour following the shooting. however, at 2:13 a.m., caldera and lerma arrived at the colmenero home in nearby whittier. melissa and amie colmenero were close friends with caldera, but barely knew lerma. melissa later told authorities that 7 she overhe we just did a jale a gang job. the nissan remained at the colmenero home until 2:24 a.m. it was returned to the knights inn soon thereafter. a few days later, around the same time, someone told sanchez to get rid of her car. she was furious, but took it to an auto body shop to have its distinctive rims removed. she also swapped the license plate for a new one. montes survived the shooting but was critically injured. the shot injured the right side of her brain, which paralyzed the left side of her body, and blinded her in one eye. montes wore a helmet in court because she was missing a palm-sized section of the back of her skull. doctors were unable to save her right ear; they removed it entirely and sewed the opening shut. after four months in the hospital, montes was released in september 2011. though she was able to testify at the preliminary hearing in the summer of 2012, during the following year and a half, montes took a turn for the worse and slipped into a vegetative state. the parties stipulated to her unavailability, and her preliminary hearing testimony was read at trial. contentions lerma contends the trial court erred by (1) not modifying the mandatory jury instruction on accomplice testimony, and (2) not awarding him an additional day of actual presentence custody credit. caldera contends that (3) her conviction for aiding and abetting attempted premeditated murder was not supported by substantial evidence, and (4) s intent and motive as to the attempted murder charge. the people contend (5) the court failed to impose required fines and fees on caldera. 8 discussion 1. the trial court properly instructed the jury that accomplice testimony must be corroborated as set forth in calcrim no. 335 at trial, trejo was called as a witness for the prosecution under a plea agreement. he testified that he met caldera and lerma at the knights inn, where they drank and did drugs together. eventually, trejo grew bored, and caldera offered him a ride to his next party. they left the motel with lerma; caldera drove, lerma sat in the front seat, and trejo sat in the back. there was loud music playing, so nobody spoke. eventually, caldera stopped the car, retrieved a cloth-wrapped item, and handed it to lerma. lerma put the item in his pocket. trejo and lerma got out of the car and walked down a nearby alley together. lerma, who said he knew a girl who lived nearby, looked into apartment windows. eventually, lerma stopped at a window and invited trejo to look inside. trejo could not see anything, so he moved aside to wait for lerma. suddenly, trejo heard several shots ring out, and took off running. as trejo scaled a nearby fence, lerma caught up and warned him that several days later, lerma called trejo and repeated his threat. based on this testimony, it is undisputed by the parties that trejo was an accomplice, rendering his testimony incompetent unless corroborated. ( 1111; people v. rodriguez (1986) 42 cal.3d 730, 759.) accordingly, the trial court instructed the jury with calcrim no. 335, the relevant instruction on accomplice testimony. although lerma neither objected to the instruction nor requested a modification, he contends on appeal that the court erred by failing, sua sponte, to alter it to testimony had to be corroborated by independent evidence of an element of the charged crimes. because calcrim no. 335 is not explicit on this point, he argues the jury could have determined was corroborated by evidence that connected lerma to the commission of the crimesrelate to an act or fact which is an element of the crime. lerma therefore asks us to hold that calcrim no. 335 incorrectly states the law. 9 a. standard of review for instructional error as a preliminary matter, we address the people argument that lerma forfeited his challenge to calcrim no. 335 because he did not object to the instruction, or seek its revision, at trial. (people v. guiuan (1998) 18 cal.4th 558, 569570.) certainly, the accomplice-corroboration requirement of section 1111 is a substantial right. (people v. rodrigues (1994) 8 cal.4th 1060, 1132.) it is also settled that a defendant need not object to preserve a challenge to an instruction that incorrectly states the law and affects his or her substantial rights. (people v. mackey (2015) 233 cal.app.4th 32, 106 (mackey); see also  1259.) instruction correct in law and responsive to the evidence was too general or incomplete unless the party has requested appropriate clarifying or amplifying language. (people v. tuggles (2009) 179 cal.app.4th 339, 364365, internal quotation marks omitted.) here, lerma does not argue that calcrim no. 335 misstates the accomplice-corroboration rule as to effectively nullify it. instead, he argues court was obligated to because lerma advocates a modification of the jury instruction rather than its complete rejection, he forfeited the issue by failing to request the additional language at trial. (mackey, supra, 233 cal.app.4th at p. 106.) notwithstanding the forfeiture, we exercise our discretion to determine whether calcrim no. 335 correctly explains the accomplice-corroboration rule. we do so to forestall a later claim that trial counsels failure to object reflects constitutionally inadequate representation, and because in the context of this case, the argument raises an issue of law that this court decides independently. (people v. mattson (1990) 50 cal.3d 826, 854.) b. calcrim no. 335 correctly explains the law enacted in 1872 and last amended in 1915, section 1111 states: can not be had upon the testimony of an accomplice unless it be corroborated by such other evidence as shall tend to connect the defendant with the commission of the offense; and the corroboration is not sufficient if it merely shows the commission of the 10 offense or the circumstances t ( 1111, as amended by stats.1915, c. 457, p. 760,  1.) calcrim no. 335 tracks the statutory language. here, after instructing the jury that trejo was an accomplice, the court explained, in relevant part: u may not convict the defendant . . . based on the testimony of an accomplice alone. you may use the testimony of an accomplice to convict a defendant only if: . . . one, [] testimony is supported by other evidence that you believe; [] two, that supporting evidence itestimony; and [] three, that supporting evidence tends to connect the defendant to the commission of the crimes. . . . [] [i]t is not enough if the supporting evidence merely shows that a crime is committed or the circumstances of its commission. the supporting evidence must tend to connect the defendant to the commission of the crime. in this appeal, lerma focuses on the requirement that the corroborating evidence must tends to connect the defendant to the commission of the crimes. he insists this language is insufficient because it does not require the corroborating evidence to relate to an act or fact which is an element of the crime. lerma is correct that some courts have used the element of the crime language to describe the accomplice-corroboration rule. however, he cites no authorityand our research reveals nonefor the proposition that calcrim no. 335 misstates the statutory requirement in the way he suggests. ( 1111.) to the contrary, the california supreme court has upheld similar instructions. (see people v. abilez (2007) 41 cal.4th 472, 504505 [instruction accurately states the law]; people v. tuggles, supra, 179 cal.app.4th at pp. 364365 [instruction does not allow jury to use as corroboration evidence].) in any event, while the courts have not addressed this precise issue, to calcrim 11 no. 335 is stylistic, not substantive.5 we therefore conclude calcrim no. 335 is not defective. c. any error was harmless even assuming calcrim no. 335 misstates the law, accomplice testimony pursuant to section 1111 is harmless where there is sufficient corroborating ev (people v. miranda (1987) 44 cal.3d 57, 100, internal citations omitted.) corroboration is binding on the reviewing court unless the corroborating evidence should not have been admitted or does not reasonably tend to connect the defendant (people v. mcdermott (2002) 28 cal.4th 946, 986.) . . . requires only slight corroboration, and the evidence need not corroborate people v. gurule (2002) 28 cal.4th 557, 628.) here, ny, there was other guilt, rendering any error in calcrim no. 335 harmless. at trial, several witnesses established that lerma took a direct but ineffective step toward killing montes by shooting her through her bedroom window.6 for example, inez chavez, who lived with her grandmother in an apartment across the alley from montes, testified that she saw . from the front of the apartment, chavez saw a nissan with fancy rims pull up and stop. a , whom she later identified 5 people v. santo (1954) 43 cal.2d 319, 327. while santo addressed section 1111, the case it quoted dealt with the corroboration necessary to validate witness testimony under section 1108, a different statute. (people v. gallardo (1953) 41 cal.2d 57, 63.) under section 1108, an abortion provider could not be convicted by the uncorroborated testimony of a woman upon whom he performed an abortion. (id. at pp. 6164.) the woman was not considered an accomplice, however, and the abortion-corroboration rule addressed different evidentiary concerns than those at issue here. further, nothing about santo or its progeny indicates that the court intended to reinterpret section 1111. 6 because lerma concedes the corroborating evidence need not establish every element of the offense, we confine our discussion to the first element. 12 as lerma, got out. chavez walked to her kitchen on the other side of the apartment, which looked out on a parallel alley, and saw two men walking towards apartment. the alley was well-lit and chavez clearly saw their faces. trejo acted as a lookout. lerma stood at the window. - he fired a gunshot with the gun, and fired additional shots. lerma and trejo ran in different directions. then chavez heard the car drive away; the sound came from the parallel alley, where she had initially spotted the nissan. chavez later identified both trejo and lerma from six-pack photographic lineups. is more than sufficient to support th 2. lerma is entitled to one additional day of actual presentence custody credit lerma contends he is entitled to one additional day of actual presentence custody credit. the people concede the error. a criminal defendant is entitled to actual custody credit for every day of incarceration in county jail, including partial days. (people v. rajanayagam (2012) 211 cal.app.4th 42, 48.) the calculation of actual custodial days includes the day of arrest and the day of sentencing. (ibid.) lerma was arrested on may 31, 2011 and sentenced on may 7, 2014. the trial court granted, and the abstract of judgment reflects, 1,072 days of actual presentence custody credit. however, the total number of days, including both the day of arrest and day of sentencing, is 1,073. accordingly, we modify the judgment to award lerma 1,073 days of actual presentence custody credit. 3. sufficient evidence supports calderas conviction for attempted first-degree murder as a direct aider and abettor caldera contends there is insufficient evidence to support her conviction for attempted first-degree murder ( 664/187, subd. (a); count one) because the people did not prove that she knew about, and specifically intended to aid and abet, lekill montes. though caldera concedes the evidence ssort of scheme for lerma to revenge himself upon the person who put him away for 13 she argues the nature of the scheme, and specific intent, are we disagree. in assessing the sufficiency of the evidence, we review the entire record to determine whether any rational trier of fact could have found the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. (people v. zamudio (2008) 43 cal.4th 327, 357.) record must disclose substantial evidence to support the verdicti.e., evidence that is reasonable, credible, and of solid valuesuch that a reasonable trier of fact could find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. (ibid.) in applying this test, we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution and presume in support of the judgment the existence of every fact the jury could reasonably deduce from the evidence. (people v. kraft (2000) 23 cal.4th 978, 1053.) the same standard applies where the conviction rests primarily on circumstantial evidence. (people v. thompson (2010) 49 cal.4th 79, 113.) we may not reweigh the evidence or resolve evidentiary conflicts. (people v. young (2005) 34 cal.4th 1149, 1181.) except for accomplice testimony, which must be corroborated, the testimony of a single witness can be sufficient to uphold a convictioneven when there is significant countervailing evidence, or the testimony is subject to justifiable suspicion. (people v. zamudio, supra, 43 cal.4th at p. 357; people v. barnwell (2007) 41 cal.4th 1038, 1052.) accordingly, we may not reverse for insufficient evidence (people v. bolin (1998) 18 cal.4th 297, 331.) . . . whether they directly commit the act constituting the offense, or aid and abet in its commission . . . are 31.) to convict on a direct aiding and criminal purpose of the perpetrator and with an intent or purpose either of committing, people v. beeman (1984) 35 first degree. ( 189.) thus, to be guilty of first-degree murder, the aider and abettor 14 must know aboutand sharepeople v. mccoy (2001) 25 cal.4th 1111, 1118; see people v. chiu (2014) 59 cal.4th 155, 159-160 [natural and probable consequences doctrine does not apply to first-degree murder].) whether a defendant has aided and abetted the commission of a crime is question of fact for the jury to determine from the totality of the circumstances people v. fleming (1961) 191 cal.app.2d 163, 169.) premeditation and people v. perez (1992) 2 cal.4th 1117, 1125.) in people v. anderson (1968) 70 cal.2d 15, 2627 (anderson), the california supreme court set forth three categories of circumstantial evidence sufficient to establish such reflectionplanning, motive, and manner of killing. usually, the people must present either very strong evidence of planning, or slightly weaker planning evidence combined with motive evidence. (id. at p. 27.) here, the evidence of planning and motive were sufficient to convict caldera of the premeditated attempted murder of montes under a direct aiding and abetting theory. at trial, the people presented evidence that lerma and caldera planned the shooting together. (anderson, supra, 70 cal.2d at pp. 2627.) importantly, caldera provided lerma with the gun before the shooting. sanchez testified she saw caldera with a cloth gun case at the knights inn. then, minutes before the shooting, caldera silently handed lerma a cloth-wrapped item, which he put in his pocket. their silence during the car ride supported a conclusion that they had worked out a plan before they left the partya conclusion reinforced by their secretive behavior at the motel. in addition, caldera drove lerma to and from the shooting. after trying although she was parked around the corner, eyewitness testimony established that the shots were loud enough for caldera to hear. the sound terrified everyone else in the areatrejo took off running; gonzalez and gollette hit the floor; chavez ran to her grandmother; and other neighbors called 911 within seconds. yet caldera waited for lerma to return to the car before driving off. the jury could have reasonably believed 15 that caldera remained calm amid the chaos because the shots did not surprise her; she knew about the plan in advance. the people also presented evidence from which the jury could have concluded that a personal relationship with lerma motivated caldera to aid and abet the crime. . . . like [a] people v. fleming, supra, 191 cal.app.2d at p. 169 [evidence of companionship relevant to aiding and abetting determination].) after leaving the party also support that conclusion. stayed in the car and waited for him to return. an hour later, they arrived at the nearby colmenero home. melissa and amie colmenero were old friends. although they barely knew lerma, caldera brought him to their house in the middle of the night. when 7 while [caldera] together, her statement provided strong evidence of her companionship with lerma and complicity in the attempted murder. (people v. thompson, supra, 49 cal.4th at p. 113 a murder for which his specific mental state is established by his actions before and durin and shooting montes in front of trejo carried an added personal benefit by demonstrating that lerma remained valuable to pico nuevo despite his incarceration. by offering trejo a ride that nightdisplay. the jury could have reasonably concluded that if caldera and lerma were in a relationship, these benefits accrued to her as well. 7 mission, such as a robbery, shooting, or other violent crime. 16 in sum, while the evidence at trial was subject to competing inferences, it is sufficient to sustain calderaconviction for attempted first-degree murder. 4. there is no reasonable likelihood the jury misunderstood or misapplied calcrim no. 375 caldera also contends the trial court erroneously instructed her jury that it could in assessing a claim of instructional error, we review the instructions as a whole to determine whether the jury may have misunderstood them in the manner suggested by defendant. (people v. frye (1998) 18 cal.4th 894, 957.) we presume the jurors are intelligent people capable of understanding and applying the instructions. (people v. carey (2007) 41 cal.4th 109, 130.) here, there is no reasonable likelihood the jurors interpreted as evidence of cal first, the instruction expressly mentioned lerma, but not caldera. because there was no evidence that caldera committed an uncharged robberyto lerma. secondrobbery could be used as evidence of her motive or specific intent. third, the jurors were instructed that some of the instructions may not apply, and that certain evidence was admitted for a limited purpose. after reviewing the instructions as a whole and considering them in light of the we conclude there is no reasonable likelihood jurors misunderstood or misapplied calcrim no. 375. 5. the court failed to impose required fines and fees on caldera the people contend the court failed to impose required fines and fees on caldera. caldera concedes the error. an unauthorized sentence may be corrected any time. (people v. dotson (1997) 16 cal.4th 547, 554, fn. 6.) required assessments, surcharges, and penalties may be corrected for the first time on appeal. (people v. castellanos (2009) 175 cal.app.4th 1524, 1530.) 17 the sentencing court must impose a $40 court security fee ( 1465.8) and a $30 court facilities assessment (gov. code,  70373) on every criminal conviction. (people v. sencion (2012) 211 cal.app.4th 480, 483484.) here, caldera was convicted of two felonies: attempted murder ( 664/187, subd. (a)) and possession of a firearm by a felon (former  12021, subd. (a)(1)). however, the court imposed only one $40 court security fee ( 1465.8) and one $30 court facilities assessment (gov. code,  70373). while the court in this case stayed count two under section 654, it was required to impose a $40 court security fee and a $30 court facilities assessment on every count of conviction, including the stayed count. (people v. sencion, supra, at p. 484.) therefore, we modify the judgment to impose an $80 court security fee ( 1465.8) and a $60 court facilities assessment (govt. code,  70373) on caldera. 18 disposition custody credit. impose an $80 court security fee ( 1465.8) and a $60 court facilities assessment (gov. code,  70373). as modified, the judgments are affirmed. we direct the court to amend the abstracts of judgment to reflect the modifications, and to forward copies of the amended abstracts of judgment to the department of corrections and rehabilitation. not to be published in the official reports lavin, j. we concur: edmon, p. j. aldrich, j.
