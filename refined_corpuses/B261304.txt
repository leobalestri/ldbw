( 211, subd. (a).) the jury also found true the allegation of use of a handgun. ( 12022.5.) the trial court found appellant had suffered six prior convictions for robbery and one for attempted robbery, and sentenced him to 44 years to life. the conviction was affirmed in people v. walcott (june 16, 1999, b121073 [nonpub opn.]). on june 13, 2014, appellant filed a petition to recall his sentence pursuant to section 1170.126. the court denied the petition because current felony falls under section 667.5, subdivision (c)(9), rendering him ineligible for resentencing. appellantnied. the resentencing provision of the three strikes reform act is reserved for those serving indeterminate life sentences for felonies by subdivision (c) of section 667.5 or subdivision (c) of section 1192.7. ( 1170.126, subd. (b).) appellantviolent felonydefined by section 667.5, subdivision (c)(9). appellant unrelated to the denial of his petition to recall his sentence. he contends that, during trial proceedings, the trial court ordered a competency hearing but that hearing was never held. he argues that (1) once the trial court ordered a competency hearing, it lacked jurisdiction to conduct further proceedings until the hearing took place; and (2) competency hearing. appellant has filed several petitions for writ of habeas corpus raising these issues, all of which have been considered and denied. appellant also argues 1 subsequent statutory references are to the penal code. 3 two attemp[t]s at rehabilitation which he did not take advantage of,served only a single term in prison. however, appellant does not seem to dispute that he e of sentencing for his current felony, and thus does not demonstrate a sentencing error. he argues that five of his strikes were charged in a single criminal complaint. that is irrelevant as it is well-established that an individual may suffer multiple strike convictions in one criminal proceeding. (people v. fuhrman (1997) 16 cal.4th 930, 939.) most importantly, athey are not proper grounds for recalling his sentence under section 1170.126. having reviewed the record, we are satisfied that no arguable issues for appeal exist. disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports epstein, p. j. we concur: willhite, j. manella, j.
