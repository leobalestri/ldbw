filed 2/27/17 p. v. williams ca2/1 not to be published in the official reports california rules of court, rule 8.1115(a), prohibits courts and parties from citing or relying on opinions not certified for publication or ordered published, except as specified by rule 8.1115(b). this opinion has not been certified for publication or ordered published for purposes of rule 8.1115. in the court of appeal of the state of california second appellate district division one the people, plaintiff and respondent, v. anthony joel williams, defendant and appellant. b277376 (los angeles county super. ct. no. ya022695) appeal from a judgment of the superior court of los angeles county, william c. ryan, judge. affirmed. richard b. lennon, under appointment by the court of appeal, for defendant and appellant. kamala d. harris, attorney general, gerald a. engler, chief assistant attorney general, lance e. winters, assistant attorney general, noah p. hill and lindsay boyd, deputy attorneys general, for plaintiff and respondent. 2 appellant anthony joel williams challenges, pursuant to proposition 36, l of his petition for recall of his indeterminate life sentence. the trial court found that he was ineligible for resentencing because he was armed during the commission of his crimes. (see pen. code  1170.126, subd. (e)(2), 667, subd. (e)(2)(c)(iii).)1 he contends that his conviction for possession of a firearm by a felon does not bar him from relief under proposition 36. we disagree and affirm. facts and proceedings below in 1995, a jury found williams guilty of possession of a firearm by a felon, in violation of former section 12021, subdivision (a).2 the jury also found that williams had two prior convictions for offenses defined as strikes in sections 667, subdivisions (b) through (i), and 1170.12, subdivisions (a) through (d). accordingly, the court sentenced him under the aw to an indeterminate term of 25 years-to-life. in 2012, the people of california voted to enact proposition 36, which provides for relief from indeterminate life sentences under the three strikes law for defendants currently serving sentences for nonviolent, nonserious felonies. ( 1170.126.) on november 26, 2012, williams filed a petition for recall of his sentence pursuant to this provision. ground that williams was ineligible for relief because he was armed during the commission of his offense. (see  1170.126, subd. (e)(2).) williams filed a reply brief and attached transcripts of his 1995 1 unless otherwise specified, all further statutory references are to the penal code. 2 in 2010, the legislature repealed section 12021 and replaced it without substantive change with section 29800. 3 trial, along with a copy of our unpublished opinion affirming his conviction. in our opinion, we described the facts of the case as follows: the police were summoned to the hawthorne apartment where [williams] was staying after receiving complaints of a domestic dispute. inside, the police found a loaded sawed-the transcripts show that during the trial, a police officer testified that he observed williams seated in a chair in the living room of the apartment, and later observed a sawed-off shotgun lying on the floor immediately adjacent to the chair. a woman who lived at the apartment testified that the gun was located underneath the chair, rather than beside it. a second police officer testified that he questioned williams after his arrest. according to this officer, williams said that a friend had left the gun at the apartment two months earlier. when the friend was arrested and did not come back to reclaim the gun, williams elected to keep it for protection. the trial court, after considering the materials both sides submitted, determined that williams was ineligible for relief under proposition 36 because he was armed during the commission of his most recent offense. discussion under section 1170.126, an inmate serving an indeterminate upon conviction . . . of a felony or felonies that are not defined as serious and/or violent felonies by subdivision (c) of section 667.5 or subdivision (c) of section 1192.7, may file a petition for a recall o(id., subd. (b).) subdivision (e)(2) of section 1170.126 creates an exception, such that inmates serving a sentence for an offense described in section 667, subdivision (e)(2)(c) are not eligible for resentencing. among the offenses described in section 667, 4 uring the commission of the current offense, the defendant used a firearm, was armed with a firearm or deadly weapon, or intended to cause great bodily injury to another personid., subd. (e)(2)(c)(iii) (subdivision (iii)). the offense for which williams is currently imprisoned, possession of a firearm by a felon, is not defined as a serious or violent felony. (see  667.5, subd. (c), 1192.7, subd. (c).) nevertheless, the trial court found williams ineligible for resentencing under section 1170.126 on the ground that he was armed with a firearm during the commission of the offense. a firearm available for use, either offensively or defensively. (people v. osuna (2014) 225 cal.app.4th 1020, 1029 (osuna); accord people v. brimmer (2014) 230 cal.app.4th 782, 793 (brimmer); people v. white (2014) 223 cal.app.4th 512, 524 (white).) the record demonstrates unequivocally that williams was armed, in that he had a gun within reach either beside or below his chair at the time the police officer first entered the apartment.3 williams contends that this does not preclude him from eligibility for resentencing. he argues that the language of the statute suggests that the factors listed in subdivision (iii) must attach to the current offense as an addition and not just be an element of williams notes that subdivision (iii) is worded differently from the two preceding subdivisions. in section 667, subdivision (e)(2)(c)(i), the voters 3 in determining whether a defendant was ineligible for proposition 36 relief because of the circumstances of his offense, a court may consider the record of the case, including the facts as stated in the appellate decision. (brimmer, supra, 230 cal.app.4th at pp. 800-801.) 5 drugs. in section 667, subdivision (e)(2)(c)(ii), they barred relief for current offense is a felony sex offense, . . . or any felony offense that results in mandatory registration as a sex offendern subdivision (iii) in place of the voters signaled an intent to forbid relief not on the basis of the elements of the current offense, but rather on additional factors separate from the elements of the offense themselves. even if we aanalysis is correct, it does not follow that he was therefore eligible for relief under proposition 36. at the time williams was convicted, [a]ny person who has been convicted of a felony under the laws of . . . the state of california . . . who owns or has in his or her possession or under his or her custody or control any firearm is guilty of a felony. this statute did not include as an element a requirement that the defendant be armed. indeed, a defendant may be guilty of illegal possession of a firearm through constructive possession, or prohibited item, either directly or through another pe (brimmer, supra, 230 cal.app.4th at p. 795.) a parolee might be guilty of illegal possession of a firearm if police find a weapon in his home during a search, but he would not have been armed with the weapon if it was not readily available for him to use. (osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1030.) thus, being armed was not an element of the offenses for which williams was convicted. williams argues that subdivision (iii) requires that there be a commission of the current offense. in other words, he argues that, 6 the nless being armed aided him in committing the current offense. we are not persuaded. as the court reasoned in osuna, the language of subdivision (iii) requires only that the defendant be armed at the time of the current offense, not that the arming facilitated the offense. (osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1032.) intent in enacting proposition 36 to draw a distinction between the illegal constructive possession of a firearm and actual possession in which the defendant has a weapon readily available for use. after reviewing the text of proposition 36 and the arguments its proposers made on its behalf, the court in osuna, supra, 225 is clear the electorates intent was not to throw open the prison doors to all third strike offenders whose current convictions were not for serious or violent felonies, but only to those who were perceived as nondangerous or posing little or no risk to the public. a felon who has been convicted of two or more serious and/or violent felonies in the past, and most recently had a firearm readily available for use, simply does not pose little or no risk to the public. [t]he threat presented by a firearm increases in direct proportion to its accessibility. obviously, a firearm that is available for use as a weapon creates the very real danger it will be used. for these reasons, we reach the same conclusion as all published cases that have considered this issue: a defendant is ineligible for resentencing under proposition 36 if he was armed at the time he committed a felony for illegal possession of a firearm.
