[diaz had seen] several things and [garcia] 7 defendants pointed guns at diaz, disarmed him of his own firearm, and made him remove his clothes. chavez was standing around five feet from diaz. while chavez pointed his gun (an wedding ring), wallet, and samsung tablet, and placed those items in his bag. after determining that diaz was not wearing microphones, defendants permitted him to get dressed. trained on diaz, told diaz to remain calm. garcia returned after around an hour. the men put diaz in the back seat of his car, with chavez and perico bookending him, chavez still armed with his ak firearm that he continued to point at diaz. perico had g. asked what was going to happen, garcia said that they would see. garcia and perico got out of the car, leaving diaz with chavez. at some point, garcia said that he did not know whether to let diaz go;

they had had sexual relations on one occasion. garcia demanded $15,000 from diaz, giving him two 8 weeks to pay. diaz was afraid to seek police assistance because garcia controlled the eastside longo gang. two days later, garcia asked diaz about the money, and garcia said that if he received orders to kill diaz, he had to comply. diaz believed garcia would kill him if he was told to do gun, told diaz he had seven days in which to pay or die. diaz was afraid. then, within a few days of the second meeting, chavez told diaz that his baby had just been born and he needed child home from the hospital. diaz gave chavez permission to use the expedition, which chavez said he would return shortly. defendants left together in the expedition; later, garcia called diaz and said that the vehicle would be considered a $5,000 expedition as stolen. because diaz lived in an area purportedly claimed by the westside longo gang, he turned to that gang for help. on or house for a meeting with three members of the westside longo gang. garcia said that he wanted diaz to accompany them and that hcell phone. perico and garcia assaulted diaz while chavez restrained cell phone and chased the gangsters from the diaz home. perico around three hours later, garcia and perico returned to thought that they knew he was home because his car was parked outside. they knocked on his door. diaz and his wife did not answer. garcia, holding a 9 gun, yelled for diaz while checking for an unsecured door or window. diaz remotely activated the alarm on his car. garcia and perico ran away. defendants and perico subsequently drove c. on the evening of november 14, 2012, long beach police officers ricardo solorio and carlos del real heard a radio call it was wanted for a felony violation. the officers observed the expedition at a red light and tried to effect a vehicle stop. the expedition fled at a high speed, eventually reaching a residential moving, garcia (the driver) got out of the vehicle, tumbled, regained his footing, and fled. officer solorio chased and caught garcia while officer del real captured chavez, the front seat passenger. a rear seat passenger escaped. after his arrest, chavez admitted that he was tubbs from the eastside longo gang, that he was seated in the front passenger seat, and that he knew the police were behind him. he denied having a firearm in the vehicle. officers searched the expedition and recovered three live .44 caliber rounds in the rear passenger side floorboard), and a smith & wesson .44 search yielded a black glove, a loaded semiautomatic .380 caliber handgun hidden behind the door panel of the right front passenger side door, and a box of .380 caliber ammunition that was concealed in an air conditioning vent in the interior cover of 10 d. the jailhouse recordings long beach police officers malcolm evans and todd johnson went to the long beach city jail on november 17, 2012. chavez had been placed in a cell equipped with a recording device with other individuals. officers evans and johnson then conversation. on november 19, 2012, chavez was transported to the los angeles county jail along with garcia and placed in a conversations on november 17, 2012, through november 19, 2012. 1. first recording () chavez said that he was in custody for kidnapping, second degree robbery, assault with a deadly weapon, evading police, and participating in a criminal [a][f] that he was willing to be the best gang member possible. chavez [g]ot was his bitch ass friend, bthat toro had searched the victim, took property, and then the victim gave his truck to toro. with respect to kidnapping, chavez said that the victim was cool one minute, then toro drugs bu,[t]ook ,garage where chavez had a rifle. the victim also said that he did 11 arrested in the truck after a high speed chase. chavez explained that the kidnapping charge was because toro had left the victim in the garage with chavez, who held him there. however, the victim then wanted to inform on them so had a burner. the other homie had a burner. we all had 2. second recording () . . . [or] 2 to direct that s*** and make sure that fool gets smashed with, 3 [a]nything i would do, my boy, is for the my . . . benefit. *** why the f*** do i want to have a f***ing truck? i mean all that s***garcia because gosnell was stealing money. garcia acted for 2 to beat them. 3 ensure that it is accomplished. 12 4 and would do anything for the 3. third recording (irc jp ) chavez said that he and garcia were charged with the [t]hey had pictures of niggas laid 5 garcia said that gosnell was in a coma and on life support, that garcia hoped he would die, and ked whether the had tied him with saran . . . s in the coma. chavez said that he put a towel over the old and told him to lay down, and that chavez did not want to hurt had set him up. e. gang evidence long beach police detective hector gutierrez testified as a gang expert. gang members were known by their monikers and sometimes by additional descriptors. [s], soldiers. above the shot callers were older gang members in prison who controlled everything. 4 . . . do . . . ispeaker was saying that his actions were intended to benefit the gang, and were not for his own personal benefit. something 5 this phrase means that they had photographs of the injured victim in the hospital. 13 snitching, or cooperating with law enforcement, was forbidden. people who broke gang rules could be beaten, shot, stabbed, or killed. disrespect and retaliation could occur within a gang, involving members of the same gang. to induce fear and earn their version of respect, gang members would commit crimes against and threaten others. gang members made money by committing crimes such as narcotics sales and extortion, as well as by intimidating people. []they purported to control. the commission of crimes by a gang level of respect individually and the gangs collectively. gang members would sometimes turn on their own. if there was a perceived act of disrespect between two members of intercede and possibly kill, beat, or discipline someone. territory is important to a gang, and the eastside longos were territorial. they would use violence to defend their territory. detective gutierrez was familiar with the eastside longo were murder, robbery, criminal threats, assault with a deadly weapon, and the sale of narcotics. in his opinion, members of the eastside longo gang individually or collectively engaged in a pattern of criminal gang activity. detective gutierrez heard about diaz in around november 2012. he did not know diaz to be an active member of the eastside longo gang, but he may have been an associate of that gang. detective gutierrez was aware of gosnell in october and november 2012 and knew gosnell to be an active member of the eastside longo gang. he was also aware of defendants and, 14 based on their admissions, knew them to be active members of the eastside longo gang. given a hypothetical based on the facts of the gosnell incident, detective gutierrez opined that the incident was committed for the benefit of the gang and was committed in association with the gang because two or more gang members acted together. the fact that acting gang members admitted their actions eight to 12 days later demonstrated that they wanted to intim given a hypothetical based on the facts of the crimes committed against diaz, detective gutierrez opined that those crimes were committed to further and benefit the gang because tation and resulted in financial gain. also, because multiple gang members committed the crimes together, they acted in association with a criminal street gang. the fact that they bragged about the crimes afterwards demonstrated a benefit to the gang through elevated reputations. given a hypothetical example based on the facts of the vehicle pursuit and arrests, those incidents benefitted, promoted, and furthered the gang because a stolen vehicle could be used to commit crimes with firearms, which would defendants evidence neither defendant testified. the parties stipulated that a trigger assembly recovered at the gosnell crime scene was examined and tested, but no dna or latent fingerprints were recovered. discussion i. robbery (count 3) chavez argues that insufficient evidence supports his conviction for robbing diaz (count 3) because there is insufficient 15 evidence that he knew of garciachavez shared that intent, or that chavez acted with that knowledge and intent to aid and abet garcia in robbing diaz. a. standard of review when a convicted defendant seeks relief based on insufficient evidence the appellate court reviews the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution and determines whether any rational trier of fact could have found substantial evidence of the essential elements of the crime. (jackson v. virginia (1979) 443 u.s. 307, 318319; people v. johnson (1980) 26 cal.3d 557, 578.) we presume every fact that the jury could reasonably deduce from the evidence in support of the judgment. (people v. kraft (2000) 23 cal.4th 978, 1053.) we do not reweigh the evidence, and we will not reverse even if a different verdict could reasonably have been reached. (people v. proctor (1992) 4 cal.4th 499, 529.) unless the testimony is physically impossible sufficient to support a conviction. (people v. young (2005) 34 cal.4th 1149, 1181.) based on circumstantial evidence. (people v. lenart (2004) 32 cal.4th 1107, 1125.) if the circumstances reasonably justify the findings, reversal is not warranted simply because the circumstances might also reasonably be reconciled with a contrary finding. (people v. albillar (2010) 51 cal.4th 47, 60.) b. relevant law possession, aspecific intent to permanently deprive the person of property. ( 211; people v. harris (1994) 9 cal.4th 407, 415.) 16 a person may be guilty for directly committing a crime or as an aider and abettor. (people v. loza (2012) 207 cal.app.4th 332, 348350.) aider and abettor liability requires proof that (1) the direct perpetrator committed a crime, (2) the defendant acted with the intent or purpose of committing, encouraging, or facilitating commission of the crime, and (3) the defendant, by act or advice, aided, promoted, encouraged, or instigated commission of the crime. (people v. perez (2005) 35 cal.4th 1219, 1225.) to aid and abet a specific inshare the specific intent of the perpetrator,knows the encouragement with the intent or purpose of facilitating the ssion of the crime.people v. mccoy (2001) 25 cal.4th 1111, 1118.) presence at the scene, companionship with the perpetrator, and conduct before and after the crime are relevant factors in determining aider and abettor liability. (people v. nguyen (2015) 61 cal.4th 1015, 1054.) gang evidence is also relevant to prove aiding and abetting. (people v. burnell (2005) 132 cal.app.4th 938, 947.) for purposes of aider and abettor liability, a robbery continues until the robbers, still in possession of the stolen property, reach a place of temporary safety. (people v. harris (1994) 9 cal.4th 407, 421.) thus, a person aids and abets a robbery if he forms the necessary intent prior to or during the carrying away of the stolen property, provided a place of temporary safety has not been reached. (people v. pulido (1997) 15 cal.4th 713, 723.) whether a place of temporary safety has been reached is determined by an objective standard and is not based on the state of mind of the perpetrators. (people v. johnson (1992) 5 cal.app.4th 552, 560.) 17 c. analysis applying these legal principles, we conclude that ample robbery of diaz. chavez aided and abetted the robbery by holding diaz at gunpoint in diaz remove his clothing and hand over all of his personal property, including his jewelry. chavez held his gun trained on while the apparent initial motive diaz was suspicion that he was a police informant, the taking of all of his personal property, including jewelry, could not reasonably have implicated that concern. moreover, the robbery continued until at least to the point defendants left with la guerrera, a confederate who picked them up, because until that time, defendants were in danger of being arrested for transporting and holding their victim at gunpoint that time, chavez held diaz at gunpoint while waiting for garcia to decide whether to release or kill diaz. diaz was under property except his jewelry. in addition, the gang evidence presented at trial further 3. (people v. burnell, supra, 132 cal.app.4th at p. 947.) although the jury acquitted defendants of attempting to murder gosnell, gosnell testified saw defendants together in the 10 years that he knew them. moreover, detective gutierrez testified that one of the eastside longstanding member of the eastside longo gang under direct 18 control of one of its leaders, chavez had a heightened knowledge to aid after the diaz robbery support his conviction. from the moment property, transported diaz to another location while garcia lry. in the incidents after the robbery, chavez assisted garcia in attempting expedition. (people v. nguyen, supra, 61 cal.4th at p. 1054 [companionship with the perpetrator and conduct before and after the crime are relevant factors in determining aider and abettor liability].) robbery is amply supported by the evidence presented at trial. ii. the trial court properly admitted defendansurreptitiously recorded jailhouse statements chavez argues that the trial court erroneously admitted his recorded jailhouse statements because they were obtained through deception and manipulation, and their admission violated his rights to due process and counsel. he claims that detectives initially arrested him for charges relating to his arrest (counts 9 & 11). then, rather than arraigning him on those charges within the time frame set forth in section 825, thus implicating his right to counsel, detectives released and rearrested him for the attempted murder of gosnell. garcia raises the same claim. 19 a. relevant trial court proceedings 1. detective gonzales was assigned to the gosnell investigation on november 8, 2012. he learned of the events involving diaz on november 14, 2012, from diaz, who reported the theft of his expedition. detective gonzales then became the lead investigator for both the gosnell and diaz crimes. the pursuit and arrest of defendants occurred on november 14, 2012, after detective gonzales spoke with diaz. defendants were arrested on their arrest-related crimes (counts 9 through 11) on november 14, 2012. they were november 16, 2012, on charges related to the gosnell incident. surreptitious recordings were made in the jailhouse of defend 17, 2012, through november 19, 2012. on november 21, 2012, gosnell, while hospitalized, identified defendants as his attackers. 2. surreptitiously recorded jailhouse statements. the people argued that the statements were admissible because defendants had not been formally charged and brought before the court. whether or not perkins[6] operation recordings are admissible, i undercover officers engaged in active questioning. the prosecutor responded that the issue was whether defendants perceived that they were speaking with police officers or their agents, or whether they thought they were speaking with other 6 illinois v. perkins (1990) 496 u.s. 292. 20 inmates. since defendants thought they were speaking with other inmates, they were not subjected to any form of custodial interrogation. thus, their recorded statements were admissible. trial counsel for chavez then stated that defendants were initially arrested on wednesday, november 14, 2012, after 5:00 p.m. therefore, they were required to be brought to court no later than monday, november 19, 2012. the third jailhouse recording was made on november 19, 2012, in custody in downtown los angeles. since they were legally required to have been brought to court by november 19, 2012, anything that occurred after they did not come to court on that date was arraignment was violated. the prosecutor responded as follows: defendants were initially arrested on wednesday, november 14, for evading officers in a high speed police chase, which led to three of the charges filed in this case (counts 9 through 11). on friday, november 16, detective gonzales released defendants on the initial charges related to the chase and then rebooked them immediately on the charges related to gosnell (counts 1 & 2). thus, the time governing when defendants were required to be brought to court on formal charges was restarted on friday, november 16. trial counsel for chavez agreed that if there had been a , he stood on his objection. counsel for each defendant agreed that it was not necessary for the prosecutor to call detectives to testify to the circumstances of the recording operations, and they agreed to stipulate to foundation for the recordings. chacounsel specifically stated that he had no objection to the methodology used in the recording operation. 21 defendants were rebooked on friday, november 16, 2012, and overruled defen b. section 825 does not apply defendants base their argument on section 825.7 but section 825 applies only to persons arrested pursuant to warrant. (people v. hughes (2002) 27 cal.4th 287, 326 -day limitation of section 825 does not apply to this case, in which people v. bonillas (1989) 48 cal.3d 757, 787, fn. contrasted with section 825 . . . . the two-day limitation is not contained in sect) persons arrested without a warrant ( 849, subd. (a).) here there is no evidence that defendants were arrested pursuant to warrant. when detectives pursued and arrested defendants, they had been told that a vehicle wanted in a felony investigation had been located. moreover, detective gonzales had just learned on the day of defendantsagainst diaz, photographs unthat had been reported stolen was observed and recovered by the police and its occupants (defendants) arrested, the diaz and gosnell incident investigations were continuing. based on this evidence, it seems that defendants were not arrested pursuant to warrant argument pursuant to section 825 fails. 7 section 825, subdivision (a), provides, in relevant part, that without unnecessary delay, and, in any event, within 48 hours 22 and, although defendants do not raise section 849 here, we conclude that it was not unreasonable for defendants not to have been arraigned until november 19, 2012. ( 849, subd. (a).) in were investigating serious crimes flowing from two separate incidents involving different victims. (people v. bonillas, supra, 48 cal.3d at p. 787.) c. the trial court properly exercised its discretion in regardless of whether the two-day limitation applies, the trial court properly exercised its discretion in admitting under massiah v. united states (1964) 377 u.s. 201, once an adversarial criminal proceeding has been initiated against a defendant, the sixth amendment right to counsel attaches and, from that time on, any incriminating statement that the government deliberately elicits from the accused in the absence of counsel is inadmissible at trial against that defendant. (id. at pp. 205207.) that said, the sixth amendment right to counsel is offense-specific. (texas v. cobb (2001) 532 u.s. 162, 167168.) particular charged offense, he or she may be questioned by police following . . . advisements with respect to any uncharged offense. [citation.] incriminating statements pertaining to those uncharged offenses, as to which the sixth amendment right has not yet attached, are admissible at a subsequent trial of those people v. slayton (2001) 26 cal.4th 1076, 1079; see also maine v. moulton (1985) 474 u.s. 159, 180, fn. crimes, as to which the sixth amendment right has not yet 23 fifth and sixth amendment rights were not violated. as to the gosnell charges, the jailhouse recordings occurred within the time frame allowed by section 825 (and necessarily within the time frame permitted by section 849). defendants were arrested on those charges on friday, november 16, 2012. forty-eight hours, excluding sunday, provided for the earliest deadline of monday, november 19, 2012. ( 825, subd. (a).) the recordings were made between november 17 and 19, 2012. since the police were within the statutory time constraint as to the gosnell charges when the gosnell charges. the appellate record is unclear as to when defendants were arrested on the charges relating to their crimes against diaz. but it is clear that as of november 19, 2012, defendants had only been arrested on the evading police, firearm possession, and gosnell charges. thus, the diaz charges are not implicated by in urging reversal, defendants argue that the police were required to arrest them on all of the charges that were ultimately filed (the evading incident, the gosnell incident, and the crimes against diaz) as of wednesday, november 14, 2012. the united states supreme court has held otherwise. (see hoffa v. united states (1966) 385 u.s. 293, 310 [to be arrested. the police are not required to guess at their peril the precise moment at which they have probable cause to arrest a suspect, risking a violation of the fourth amendment if they act too soon, and a violation of the sixth amendment if they wait too long. law enforcement officers are under no constitutional duty to call a halt to a criminal investigation the moment they have the minimum evidence to establish probable cause, a quantum of evidence which may fall far short of the amount necessary to 24 people v. webb (1993) 6 cal.4th 494, 527528.) d. any error was harmless jailhouse statements, which it did not, that error would have been harmless. (people v. watson (1956) 46 cal.2d 818, 836; chapman v. california (1967) 386 u.s. 18, 26.) defendants were acquitted on counts 1 and 2, despite ported cellmate that gosnell, and that he hoped gosnell would die. as for the counts on which defendants were convicted, defendants suffered no prejudice as a result of the admission of the jailhouse recordings. on counts 9, 10, and 11, defendants were caught in possession of firearms after trying to evade the police in a high speed chase. the strength of that evidence rendered superfluous any recorded statements. as for the counts relating to the crimes against diaz, the evidence was defendants were arrested driving the expedition that they stole from diaz. jailhouse statements into evidence was harmless as a matter of law. iii. pursuant to section 654 chavez argues that the trial court violated the principles of section 654 by sentencing him for both robbery and false imprisonment because, he claims, each crime occurred during an indivisible course of conduct pursuant to a single objective. 25 a. relevant trial court proceedings defendants were convicted on count 3 for the second robbery of diaz and on count 5 s false imprisonment by enhancements. in their sentencing memorandum, the people argued that section 654 did not apply to any of the conviction counts. while the appellate record does not contain a sentencing memorandum filed by chavez, garcia filed one and argued that section 654 applied to counts 3 and 5. in her closing argument to the jury, the prosecutor argued the following: determine whether he was a police informant; he was stripped and examined for microphones. the robbery occurred in the property while chavez held diaz at gunpoint. later, after diaz returned; he was given some items, but not his jewelry. argued that section 654 did not apply to counts 3 and 5 because but diaz was held for hours afterwards, leading to the false imprisonment with violence count. she also argued that there were two acts of false imprisonment, first in then in the car after they left the garage. counsel for chavez responded that there was only one act of false imprisonmentand any been for kidnapping since defendants moved diaz a substantial distance. counsel further asserted that the trial court could sentence chavez separately on each of counts 3 and 5 because they were different acts. however, he argued that the 26 enhancements on those coconcurrently or else section 654 would apply. after entertaining oral argument, the trial court sentenced chavez to five years for the robbery, 10 years for its firearm enhancement, and 10 years for its gang enhancement. for false imprisonment, chavez received 16 months, plus 10 years for the firearm enhancement and three years for the gang enhancement. onduct attorney] stated from basically the same concurrently to that on count 3. on march 6, 2017, the trial court sentenced garcia to six years for his robbery conviction on count 3, plus 10 years for its gang enhancement. during the false imprisonment, were intended to terrorize diaz so he would not inform on defendants. given the common goal and objective, section 654 barred separate punishment on count 5. on count 5, the trial court sentenced garcia to two years, plus counsel, the trial court determined that section 654 applied and stayed sentence on count 5. b. relevant law section 654 prohibits punishment for multiple crimes arising from a single indivisible course of conduct. (people v. latimer (1993) 5 cal.4th 1203, 12071208.) multiple statutory provisions rather than temporal proximity. (people v. britt (2004) 32 cal.4th 944, 952.) if all the crimes for which the defendant was convicted were merely incidental to or the means of accomplishing or facilitating one objective, he may be punished only once. (ibid.) however, multiple punishments 27 are proper if the defendant entertained multiple independent criminal objectives. (people v. harrison (1989) 48 cal.3d 321, 335.) whether section 654 applies is a question of fact for the trial court, which is vested with broad latitude in making its determination; its findings, including implied findings, will not be reversed on appeal if there is any substantial evidence to support them. (people v. jackson (2016) 1 cal.5th 269, 354.) where section 654 applies, a trial court may not impose concurrent sentences. instead, it should stay imposition of sentence on one of the counts. (people v. monarrez (1998) 66 cal.app.4th 710, 713.) if the base term of a sentence is stayed under section 654, the attendant enhancements must also be stayed. (people v. guilford (1984) 151 cal.app.3d 406, 411.) c. analysis argument that the robbery and false imprisonment stemmed from the same conduct; chavez was ordered to serve his sentences for counts 3 and 5 concurrently. the trial court went one step further when it sentenced garcia two months later: it count 5. in ligcount 5, we conclude that section 654 applies to chavez. he should not have been ordered to serve his sentence on count 5 concurrently with his sentence on count 3. instead, his sentence on count 5 should have been stayed. (people v. jones (2012) 54 difference between imposing concurrent sentences, as the trial court did, and staying sentence on [the second conviction], as [chavez] urges, the law is settled that the sentences must be stayed to the extent that section 654 prohibits multiple 28 iv. the firearm enhancement imposed under section 12022.53 on count 5 does not apply to false imprisonment chavez asserts that a 10-year sentence enhancement was erroneously imposed on count 5 under section 12022.53 because that section does not apply to that particular conviction. he asks that the matter be remanded for resentencing under section 12022.5, subdivision (a). the people agree. we agree with the parties. section 12022.53 does not apply to false imprisonment under section 236. (see  12022.53, subd. (a).) accordingly, the matter is remanded for resentencing on count 5 firearm enhancement pursuant to section 12022.5. (people v. fialho (2014) 229 cal.app.4th 1389, 13941397.) v. the matter is remanded for reconsideration of imposed on counts 3 and 5 under senate bill number 620 chavez asserts that the matter should be remanded for resentencing on the firearm enhancement imposed on counts 3 and 5 under section 12022.5, subdivision (a), pursuant to senate bill number 620 (2017-2018 reg. sess.). the people agree. the trial court sentenced chavez to the high term on count 3 of five years. ten-year terms were imposed for each of the firearm and gang enhancements on count 3, for a total sentence on that count of 25 years. the trial court imposed the low term of 16 months on count 5, plus 10 years for the firearm enhancement and three years for the gang enhancement, and ordered that the term on count 5 run concurrently to that imposed on count 3. authority to strike firearm enhancements proven under sections 12022.5 and 12022.53. but, senate bill number 620, which became effective in january 2018, removed the prohibition; sections 12022.5 and 12022.53 now give trial courts the discretion 29 to strike an enhancement. we therefore remand the matter to the trial court to consider whether to strike the firearm enhancements pursuant to the discretion now conferred by senate bill number 620. vi. the trial court was not required to give a unanimity instruction as to either count 4 (criminal threats) or count 5 (false imprisonment) garcia argues that he was denied his right to a unanimous verdict under the california constitution as to counts 4 and 5. specifically, as to the criminal threats count, garcia claims that the prosecutor identified in her argument to the jury two garage, and another on the day when garcia and perico took westside longos. regarding false imprisonment, garcia again there were two separate acts of false imprisonment and the jury had to agree unanimously that defendants committed one of them; it was up to the jury to determine which one had been committed. chavez joins in the argument as to count 5. a. relevant trial court proceedings count 4 charged defendants with committing the crime of making criminal threats on or between october 1, 2012, and october 30, 2012. count 5 charged defendants with committing false imprisonment by violence during the same time period. after all of the trial evidence was presented, the prosecutor moved to extend the period to november 10, 2012, to conform to the evidence, in pertinent part, counts 3 through 6. over 30 1. trial evidence a. criminal threats confronted diaz at ave diaz alone. diaz understood garcia wanted to kill him, but garcia did not threaten him on that date. around two days later, garcia inquired about the $15,000 and told diaz that if he was ordered to kill diaz, he would do so. and, garcia told diaz that he had seven days to pay the money or garcia would kill him. members of the westside longos, garcia tried to force diaz to leave with defendants and perico. diaz believed that they would kill him. with the assistance of his wife, diaz successfully resisted their efforts. b. false imprisonment over an hour. they then transported him at gunpoint to another location where, after weighing the matter, they released him. 2. a. false imprisonment the prosecutor stated that the false imprisonment on count diaz was taken in his car to the mechanitwo separate acts of false imprisonment here; we have one in the determine which one you believe it was. you need to all determine and agree on the same one but we actually have two acts here, both of which would qualify for that crime. so you need to unanimously agree on one of them to find the defendantsstrike that. you need to unanimously agree that 31 each of these defendants committed at least one of these acts of b. criminal threats the prosecutor explained that the criminal threats charge on count 4 related to conduct in the days following the false november 2012. on that occasion, garcia accused diaz of sexually assaulting ruby, demanded $15,000, and said he would kill diaz if ordered to do so. the prosecutor then referenced the kill diaz, he would do so. the prosecutor also told the jury that the second threat was outside the time frame alleged by the people in count 5. 3. jury instruction conference and jury instructions given during the jury instruction conference, the parties did not discuss whether unanimity instructions should be given as to any of the counts. the trial court instructed the jury, in relevant part, as in this case from in arriving at verdicts, and not anything said by the attorneys. the instructions were to be considered as a whole and in light of all of the other instructions. statements by the attorneys were recollection and his or her notes, or between or among jurors, the jury could request a readback of testimony. evidence consisted of testimony and exhibits. each count charged a distinct crime and must be decided separately. and, in order to reach a verdict, all 32 findings. b. relevant law and analysis a criminal defendant is entitled to a unanimous verdict in which all 12 jurors concur as a matter of due process under the california and federal constitutions. (people v. russo (2001) 25 cal.4th 1124, 1132.) thus, when the evidence shows more than one unlawful act that could support a single charged offense, the prosecution must either elect which act it is relying upon or the trial court must instruct the jurors sua sponte that they must unanimously agree which act constituted the crime. (people v. jennings (2010) 50 cal.4th 616, 679.) accordingly, a unanimity instruction is appropriate when conviction on a single count could be based on multiple criminal events, but not where multiple theories or acts may form the basis of a guilty verdict on one discrete criminal event. (people v. russo, supra, at pp. 11341135.) a unanimity instruction is not required in all cases where the evidence establishes that more than one act could support required only if the jurors could otherwise disagree which act a w]here the acts were substantially identical in nature, so that any juror believing one act took place would inexorably believe all acts took place, the instruction is not (people v. champion (1995) 9 cal.4th 879, 932.) in other words, a unanimity instruction is not required if in time as to form part of one people v. jennings, supra, 50 cal.4th at p. 679.) continuous conductoffers essentially the same defense to each of the acts, and there 33 is no reasonable basis for the (people v. stankewitz (1990) 51 cal.3d 72, 100.) similarly, a unanimity instruction is not or acts may form the basis of a guilty verdict on one discrete people v. hajek and vo (2014) 58 cal.4th 1144, 1221.) when the evidence shows only a single crime, but leaves room for disagreement as to how that crime was not unanimously agree on the theory under which the defendant is guilty. (people v. jenkins (2000) 22 cal.4th 900, 10241026.) in deciding whether the trial court should have given a unanimity instruction we conduct a de novo review. (people v. lueth (2012) 206 cal.app.4th 189, 195.) 1. criminal threats showing that a second threat was made to diaz. the jury was told that its decision had be unanimous on the evidence, that statements by the attorneys were not evidence, and that the jury must follow the law as instructed by the trial court. we presume the jurors understood and followed the trial (people v. hajek and vo, supra, 58 cal.4th at p. 1229.) statement that garcia restated the threat to kill diaz if ordered th the westside longo members, that argument fails for procedural reasons. defendants should have objected at that time to the thereby forfeiting any objection on appeal. (people v. tully (2012) 54 cal.4th 952, 1010.) in any event, a unanimity instruction was not required because all of the acts were so closely connected that they formed part of one transaction. the bottom line is that defendants 34 threatened diaz after they were informed he was a police informant. 2. false imprisonment felony false imprisonment requires proof that defendants unlawfully violated the personal liberty of another through violence greater than necessary to simply restrain the victim. (people v. newman (2015) 238 cal.app.4th 103, 108.) here, there was only one act of false imprisonment. it began when diaz was certainly defendants unlawfully restrained diaz in the garage by means of violence, as the prosecutor argued. but there was no interruption of the restraint of diaz; his liberty was violated throughout the car ride to the was released. thus, there was only one act of false imprisonment, and no unanimity instruction was required. all of the acts in question were part of one transaction, and there was no reasonable basis for the jury to distinguish between the different parts of the same criminal event.8 (people v. hajek and vo, supra, 58 cal.4th at p. 1221; people v. jennings, supra, 50 cal.4th at p. 679.) as the people concede, the prosecutor did inform the jury that there were two acts of false imprisonment and the jury was required to unanimously agree that each defendant committed counsel should have lodged an objection and/or sought an admonition at the time. by failing to do so, defendants have 8 it seems that if a separate charge had been brought for en for below. 35 forfeited this objection on appeal. (people v. tully, supra, 54 cal.4th at p. 1010.) c. any alleged error was harmless even if the trial court had erred by failing to give a unanimity instruction, any alleged error was harmless as a matter of law. (chapman v. california, supra, 386 u.s. at p. 24; people v. watson, supra, 46 cal.2d at p. 836.) because the jury was presented with overwhelming evidence of , the result would not have been any different. it follows that any alleged error was harmless. vii. the trial court erroneously sentenced garcia to six years in prison on count 3 garcia argues that the trial court erroneously sentenced him to six years in state prison on count 3 (first degree robbery), as opposed to five years in state prison, which is the high term for second degree robbery. the people agree. the information charged defendants with second degree robbery. during the jury instruction conference, counsel all agreed that robbery was charged as second degree robbery. during her opening statement, the prosecutor indicated that when the trial court gave its instructions to the jury, it pointed out that there are two degrees of robbery. in this case, the trial court you that it is robbery of the second degree and, the jury was given a verdict form for chavez that did not provide for a finding as to the degree of robbery and only applied to second degree robbery. in spite of the foregoing, the verdict form as to garcia, asked the jury to find whether he was guilty of first or second degree robbery, and the jury found the robbery to be in the first degree. it does not appear that the jury was instructed on how to distinguish between first and second degree robbery. the 36 convicted of second degree robbery, and the people asked for a five-year term for that count. at the sentencing hearing, the trial court stated, without objection, that garcia had been convicted of first degree robbery. it sentenced him to the high term of six years. in light of this procedural background, we agree with the parties that garcia should have been sentenced to five years in state prison on count three for second degree robbery. viii. the trial court properly sentenced garcia to two years after finding that two prior prison term allegations pursuant to section 667.5, subdivision (b), were true garcia asserts that the trial court improperly imposed one of two one-year sentencing enhancements under section 667.5, subdivision (b), [u]nder some circumstances, burglary is conviction was for a felony. a. relevant trial court proceedings the information alleged that garcia had served three prior prison terms under section 667.5, subdivision (b): (1) in case number n(3) that garcia would waive a jury with respect to the trial on the prior convictions. a court trial proceeded on the three prior prison term allegations. 1. umber 100, a certified section 969b prison packet from the california 37 department of corrections and rehabilitation for garcia, under number 100 was a certified abstract of judgment in people v. garcia, los angeles county superior court case number na063229. that abstract showed that on october 20, 2004, garcia pled guilty to unlawfully concealing and selling stolen property violation of section was granted probation, which was revoked, and he was then sentenced to three years in state prison on february 4, 2005. umber 100 was a certified abstract of judgment in people v. garcia, in los angeles county superior court case number na084921, showing that he pled guilty on march 9, 2010, to possessing a controlled substance for sale in violation of health and safety code section 11378, for which he was sentenced on the same day to one year four months in state prison. umber 101 was a certified court docket for garcia in los angeles county superior court case number na089719. pages three and four of that exhibit disclosed that on october 24, 2011, garcia pled nolo contendere to having violated section 459. as a result of that plea, probation was denied and garcia was ordered to serve two years, the midterm as selected by the sentencing court, in county jail pursuant to section 1170, subdivisions (h)(1) and (h)(2). umbers 100 and 101, ladan stated that garcia did not remain free of both prison custody and the commission of an offense that resulted in a felony conviction for a period of five years or more after he first entered the prison system on february 23, 2005. 38 2. lorraine lu luna, a fingerprint classifier for the long beach police gerprints in the two persons had the same fingerprints. 3. argument and trial court ruling garcia objected to the adnumber a finding the priors the prosecutor argued that the people had proved that the convictions alleged with respect to the prior prison terms in question belonged to garcia. the trial court agreed, finding that s pursuant to 667.5(b) and do in fact 4. sentencing in their sentencing memorandum, the people asserted that the two surviving prior prison term enhancements that resulted in the imposition of one-year terms were for receiving stolen property ( 496d, subd. (a)) and possession of a controlled substance for sale (health & saf. code,  11378). the trial court sentenced garcia b. analysis the imposition of a one-year term under section 667.5, subdivision (b), resulting from a burglary conviction that the trial court found that he had suffered, but not one on which the trial court sentenced him. the trial court found true the three prior prison term allegations, but sentenced garcia on only two of 39 them. it seems that the trial court sentenced garcia as requested by the people in their sentencing memorandum, a one-year term for receiving stolen property and a one-year term for possession of a controlled substance for sale. and garcia does not challenge those enhancements. regardless, on the merits, the trial court properly imposed two one-year enhancements because all of its true findings are supported by substantial evidence. (people v. tenner (1993) 6 cal.4th 559, 567; people v. buycks (2018) 5 cal.5th 857, 889.) the people presented certified offprior prison terms. (people v. delgado (2008) 43 cal.4th 1059, 1066; people v. prieto (2003) 30 cal.4th 226, 258.) while garcia complains that there was no proof that his prior burglary was a felony, the fact that he was sentenced to prison demonstrates that it was for a felony. (people v. buycks, supra, at p. 889.) people v. gallardo (2017) 4 cal.5th 120 (gallardo) does not compel a different result. in that case, our supreme court found that the trial court erroneously relied upon a preliminary hearing transcript when it determined that a prior conviction for assault with a deadly weapon or by means likely to cause great bodily injury, to which the defendant pled guilty, was a serious felony. after all, nothing in the record of the assault conviction showed that the defendant had adopted the preliminary hearing transcript as the factual basis for her plea to that felony. (id. at pp. 125126, 136.) in contrast, here there is no evidence that the trial court relied upoprior burglary conviction was a felony. moreover, as set forth above, garcia was sentenced for burglary pursuant to section 1170, subdivisions (h)(1) and (h)(2). those subdivisions apply, by their very terms, to felonies. 40 ix. the trial court properly imposed fees and assessments against chavez in a supplemental brief filed february 7, 2019, chavez argues that the trial court erred in imposing two assessments and a restitution fine for a total of $7,710 without first determining that he is able to pay, in violation of his right to due process. in support, he relies upon people v. dueas (2019) 30 cal.app.5th 1157, 11631173 (dueas). we are not convinced. based on the constitutional guarantees of due process and excessive fines, dueas held that trial courts may not impose three of the standard criminal assessments and finesnamely, the $30 court operations assessment ( 1465.8), the $40 criminal conviction assessment (gov. code,  70373), and the $300 restitution fine ( 1202.4)(dueas, supra, 30 cal.app.5th at pp. 1164, 1172, fn. 10.) we need not decide whether we agree with dueas because chavez is not entitled to a remand even if we accept dueas. that is because the record in this case, unlike the record in dueas, indicates that chavez has the ability to pay the assessments and fines imposed in this case. wages and to earn money people v. hennessey (1995) 37 cal.app.4th 1830, 1837; people v. gentry (1994) 28 cal.app.4th 1374, 1376.) prisoners earn wages ranging from $12 per month (for the lowest skilled jobs) to $72 per month (for the highest). (cal. dept. of corrections & rehabilitation, operations manual,  51120.6, 51121.10 (2019).) at these rates, lengthy sentence, he will have enough to pay the assessments and fines.9 9 even if chavez does not voluntarily use his wages to pay the amounts due, the state may garnish between 20 and 50 41 ument that the $7,500 restitution fine must be stayed unless and until the people prove he has a present ability to pay. chavez forfeited his challenge to before dueas, a trial court coulhere. ( 1202.4, subds. (b)(1), (c).) chavez did not present any evidence regarding his ability to pay to the trial court at sentencing. as a result, the issue has been forfeited on appeal. (see, e.g., people v. gibson (1994) 27 cal.app.4th 1466, 14681469.) even if the issue were not forfeited, because chavez to no evidence in the record sup(people v. gamache (2010) 48 cal.4th 347, 409), a remand would serve no purpose. disposition regarding chavez, the trial court is directed to modify the judgment so that the sentence for count 5 is imposed and stayed pursuant to section 654. the matter is also remanded for resentencing on counts 3 and 5 pursuant to section 12022.5, subdivision (a), and senate bill number 620. regarding garcia, the matter is remanded to the trial court with instructions to modify his sentence on count 3, reducing it from six years to five years in state prison. percent of those wages to pay the restitution fine. ( 2085.5, subds. (a) & (c); people v. ellis (2019) 31 cal.app.5th 1090, 1094.) 42 the trial court shall amend the abstracts of judgment accordingly and forward copies thereof to the department of corrections and rehabilitation. in all other respects, the judgments are affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. _______________________, j. ashmann-gerst we concur: ________________________, p. j. lui ________________________, j. hoffstadt
