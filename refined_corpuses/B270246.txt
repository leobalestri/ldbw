( 290.008, subd. (a).) violation of section 289 is an enumerated offense under both statutes. 4 california or residing at the usc campus. defendant admitted that he last registered on may 17, 2012, and that he had suffered prior convictions in 1996 and 2012 for failing to register. he further admitted that he had been in los angeles for approximately one month before his arrest. at the conclusion of the trial, the jury found defendant guilty and found the prior conviction allegations to be true. the sentenced him to state prison for two years, doubled to four years pursuant to sections 667, subdivisions (b) though (i) and 1170.12, subdivisions (a) through (d). this appeal followed. discussion i. applicable law and legal principles a. ex post facto analysis article i, section 10, clause 1 of the federal constitution . . . pass any . . . ex post facto law.similarly provides that an ex post facto law . . . may not be collins v. youngblood (1990) 497 u.s. 37, 43; people v. grant (1999) 20 cal.4th 150, 158.) to determine whether a particular law is punishment for purposes of an ex post facto analysis, the united states supreme court, in smith v. doe (2003) 538 u.s. 84 (smith), prescribed a two-part test. under part one of that test, a court must determine whether the legislature intended to impose id. at p. 92.) if the court r5 to deem it ibid.) to make this latter determination, a court must apply the factors set forth in kennedy v. mendoza-martinez (1963) 372 u.s. 144 (mendoza-martinez). (smith, at p. 97.) these factors, which are neither exhaustive nor dispositive(ibid.), include whether the law imposes what has been viewed traditionally as punishment, creates an affirmative disability or restraint, promotes the traditional aims of punishment, has a rational connection to a nonpunitive purpose, or is excessive with respect to the nonpunitive purpose. (in re alva (2004) 33 cal.4th 254, 266-267 (alva).) b. sex offender registration for juvenile offenders section 290.any person who, on or after january 1, 1986, is discharged or paroled from the department of corrections and rehabilitation to the custody of which he or she was committed after having been adjudicated a ward of the juvenile court pursuant to section 602 of the welfare and institutions code because of the commission or attempted commission of any offense described in subdivision (c) shall register in accordance with the [sex offender registration] act.the statute imposes a lifetime registration requirement on juvenile offenders who were committed to the california youth authority3 for an enumerated sex offense. (in re robert m. (2013) 215 cal.app.4th 1178, 1182-1183 (robert m.).) ii. sex offender registration is not punishment a statute violates the ex post facto clauses of the federal and california constitutions only if it retroactively imposes 3 the california youth authority is now known as the division of juvenile facilities, which is within the department of corrections and rehabilitation. (in re j.l. (2008) 168 cal.app.4th 43, 47, fn. 1.) 6 punishment for a criminal act. (collins v. youngblood, supra, 497 u.s. at p. 43; people v. grant, supra, 20 cal.4th at p. 158.) sex supreme court confirmed beyond doubt that laws requiring the registration of convicted sex offenders -- including now common provisions for public dissemination of information about the identity and whereabouts of dangerous offenders -- do not impose punishment for purposes of the federal ex post facto clause. [citation.]alva, supra, 33 cal.4th at p. 273, citing smith.) the california supreme court has also held that mandatory sex offender registration required by section 290 is not punishment for purposes of the ex post facto clause of the california constitution. (alva, at p. 292; people v. castellanos (1999) 21 cal.4th 785, 796 (castellanos).) our state high court concluded that the law is regulatory in nature, intended to assure that persons convicted of enumerated crimes shall be readily available for police surveillance at all times because the legislature has deemed them likely to commit similar offenses in the future. (castellanos, at p. 796.) defendant contends the foregoing authorities should be reconsidered in light of statutory amendments subsequent to his 1986 conviction that imposed additional restrictions. he cites amendments that extend the registration requirements to sex offenders who are out-of-state residents employed in california or enrolled in california educational institutions ( 290.002, 290.009); that require offenders to provide and keep current substantial quantities of personal information, including a list of all internet service providers and internet identifiers used, address, employment, and vehicle ownership ( 290.012, 290.013, 290.015); that allow law enforcement agencies to public upon request for such information ( 290.45); and that 7 impose restrictions on residency, travel, and entry onto school grounds and adult care facilities ( 626.81, 653c, 3003.5). defendant contends these additional restrictions make section 290 an ex post facto law because they post-date the commission of his qualifying crimes and apply retroactively. conviction do not apply retroactively. rather, they apply prospectively to conduct occurring after their statutory effective dates. for example, with regard to residency restrictions imposed in 2006 making it unlawful for a person required to register as a sex offender to live near a school or park where children regularly gather ( 3003.5), the california supreme court concluded that the restrictions do not constitute 3003.5 applies to defendant solely by virtue of his status as a registered sex offender, the residency restrictions apply to not impose additional punishment for his 1986 conviction. (in re e.j. (2010) 47 cal.4th 1258, 1276-1278, 1280.) the same analysis applies with respect to the other restrictions imposed after ex post facto clauses of the federal or california constitutions. (e.j., at p. 1280.) defendant argues that neither the united states supreme court nor the california supreme court has considered whether the mandatory lifetime sex offender registration requirement as applied to juvenile offenders constitutes punishment in violation of the federal and california ex post facto clauses. he argues that a different standard should apply to persons who were convicted of a qualifying sex crime before the age of 18. as support for his position, defendant cites dissenting opinions by justices stevens and ginsberg in smith, and studies that 8 conclude that juvenile sex offenders recidivate at lower rates than adult offenders. the dissenting opinions and the cited studies are not a valid basis for departing from applicable federal and california supreme court authority. (see auto equity sales inc. v. superior court (1962) 57 cal.2d 450, 455-456 [appellate courts are bound by decisions of the california supreme court].) as further support for his argument that a different standard should apply to juvenile offenders required to register as sex offenders, defendant cites roper v. simmons (2005) 543 u.s. 551 (roper) and graham v. florida (2010) 560 u.s. 48 (graham), in which the united states supreme court held that the eighth amendment prohibits imposition of the death penalty on juvenile offenders whose crimes were committed before the age of 18 (roper, at p. 568), and a life sentence without parole on juvenile defendants who did not commit homicide (graham, at p. 68). both of those cases involved the imposition of indisputably criminal punishments -- the death penalty and life imprisonment. neither roper nor graham addressed whether a statute that is regulatory in nature, such as section 290, was intended to impose constitute punishment for ex post facto purposes. that issue was squarely decided by the united states supreme court in smith, and by the california supreme court in castellanos and alva. both courts concluded that sex offender registration laws such as section 290 do not constitute punishment in violation of the federal and california ex post facto clauses. (smith, supra, 538 u.s. at p. 93; castellanos, supra, 21 cal.4th at p. 796.) defendant provides no valid basis for concluding that sex offender registration, as applied to juvenile offenders, constitutes punishment in violation of the federal or california ex post facto clauses. under the two-part test prescribed by the united states supreme court in smith, the statute is not punitive. there is no 9 evidence the legislature intended sex offender registration as a punishment for juvenile offenders. rather, the evidence is to the contrary. the lifetime registration requirement applies only to juveniles who were committed to the california youth authority for committing an enumerated offense. ( 290.008; robert m., supra, 132 cal.app.4th at p. 1183.) it does committed to juvenile hall for the same sexual offenses. [citation.]robert m., at p. 1183.) by distinguishing between penal measure otherwise reserved for convicted criminals. it been subjected to the most restrictive of all juvenile court dispositions, youth authority cin re bernardino s. (1992) 4 cal.app.4th 613, 621.) the registration requirement as applied to juvenile offenders is regulatory in nature. (ibid.; castellanos, supra, 21 cal.4th at p. 796.) applying part two of the smith test, sex offender registration in california is not punitive in effect. (alva, supra, 33 cal.4th at p. 279.) our state high court reached this conclusion after applying the factors set forth in mendoza-martinezpunishment, imposes no direct disability or restraint beyond the inconvenience of compliance, and has a legitimate nonpenal objective. though registration may have incidental deterrent or retributive effects, and applies to conduct which is already a regulatory nature. nor is it dispositive that the registration statute appears in the penal code, and that the obligation to alva, supra, 33 cal.4th at p. 279.) 10 finally, the registration requirement is not excessive in relation to its regulatory purpose. the statute applies only to those juvenile offenders whose dangerousness and risk of recidivism warrant imposition of the registration requirement. (bernardino s., supra, 4 cal.app.4th at pp. 620-drawn by the legislature may not include all juvenile wards as to whom the degree of dangerousness is unacceptably high, and it may not exclude all those as to whom the risk is low. however, the legislature is not required to formulate a perfect classification or a perfect test. if it were, few statutory distinctions cid. at p. 621.) the lifetime sex offender registration requirement as applied to persons who committed qualifying sex offenses as juveniles is not punishment. the requirements accordingly do not violate the federal or california ex post facto clauses. iii. cruel and unusual punishment in view of our holding that sex offender registration as applied to juvenile offenders does not constitute punishment, we need rgument that it violates federal and california constitutional prohibitions against cruel and unusual punishment. iv. substantive due process defendant contends the registration requirement violates his substantive due process rights to certain liberty interests, including the ability to change residences and to live in certain areas, enter schools and parks, and pursue certain occupations. defendant failed to raise this argument in the trial court below and failed to present any evidence to support the merits of his as applied constitutional challenge. he accordingly forfeited the right to do in this appeal. (see in re taylor (2015) 60 cal.4th 1019, 1039 [as applied constitutional challenge contemplates analysis of facts and circumstances of a particular case]; people v. 11 jeha (2010) 187 cal.app.4th 1063, 1078 [court will exercise discretion to consider substantive due process claim not raised in the trial court if it involves only application of legal principles to undisputed facts].) disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. ____________________________, j. chavez we concur: __________________________, acting p. j. ashmann-gerst __________________________, j. hoffstadt
