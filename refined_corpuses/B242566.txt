(a) (d). on april 30, 2012, a second amended information added the allegations that the attempted murder was committed willfully, deliberately, and with premeditation within the meaning of section 664, subdivision (a). the trial court informed defendant that his maximum penalty was life plus 25 years to life. on may 1, 2012, defendant agreed to a plea bargain. the trial court granted the peopleinterest of justice. after being advised of his constitutional rights and the consequences -upon sentence of 19 years. on june 18, 2012, defendant filed a notice of appeal asserting that the appeal was based on the sentence or other matters occurring after the plea and that the appeal cause stated that he was willing to take a plea of 10 years, but not 19 years. he asserted he was not guilty of attempted murder, and his attorney lied to him about his plea and then scared him into taking 19 years. he would feel justice was served if he received a sentence modification, but otherwise, he would like to go to trial. the trial court denied defte of probable cause. section 1237.5 provides, in pertinent part, no appeal shall be taken by the defendant from a judgment of conviction upon a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, . . . except where both of the following are met: [] (a) the defendant has filed with the trial court a written statement, executed under oath or penalty of perjury showing reasonable constitutional, jurisdictional, or other grounds going to the legality of the proceedings. [] (b) the trial court has executed and filed a certificate of probable cause for such appeal . . . . california rules of court, rule 8.304(b) sets forth both the section 1237.5 4 rule and its exceptions. if the trial court denies a certificate of probable cause, the appeal is inoperative unless the appeal is based on the denial of a motion to suppress evidence or ce with the plea bargain to which he agreed may not be raised on appeal. in people v. panizzon (1996) 13 cal.4th 68, 89, the supreme court held that where a defendant is sentenced in accordance with the terms of a plea bargain that provides for a particular sentence, and then attempts to challenge that sentence on appeal, he must secure a certificate of probable cause. the cpart of the plea [and] is, in substance, a challenge to the validity of the plea, which requires compliance with the probable cause certificate requirements of section 1237.5 id. at p. 73; accord people v. cuevas (2008) 44 cal.4th 374, 382-384.) in people v. mendez (1999) 19 cal.4th 1084, the california supreme court interpreted former california rules of court, rule 31(d), which corresponds to current rule 8.304(b)(1)(3), and held that section 1237.5 and its implementing rules of court people v. mendez, supra, at p. 1098.) the record clearly shows that the parties expressly agreed to imposition of a 19-year sentence. defendant was facing a possible sentence of life plus 25 years if the jury convicted him of the attempted murder and found the allegations true. since defendant received the sentence for which he bargained, any challenge to his sentence constitutes a challenge to the validity of his plea. (people v. cuevas, supra, 44 cal.4th at p. 384.) in the absence of a certificate of probable cause, we must dismiss defendants appeal. attorneys have fully complied with their responsibilities and that no arguable issues exist. (people v. wende (1979) 25 cal.3d 436, 441.) the appeal is dismissed. not to be published in the official reports.
