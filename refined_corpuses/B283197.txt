(b)-(d).) the trial court sentenced delgado to a prison term of 50 years to life. delgado argues that the trial court committed several prejudicial evidentiary errors and coerced a jury verdict and that the prosecutor engaged in misconduct. we affirm the conviction, but remand to allow the trial court to exercise discretion to dismiss or strike the firearm enhancements. factual and procedural background a. delgado kills plascencia 1. the party in the summer of 2006 edwin delgado (edwin) overheard his brother omar delgado (delgado) speaking with girlfriend, iris, by telephone. edwin and delgado were in arizona, and iris was in southern california. delgado was angry because plascencia had been flirting with iris. 3 several weeks later delgado and edwin drove to los angeles and stayed with a friend in lynwood. on july 7, 2006 they went to a party in lynwood with flores, plascencia, and daniel renteria. at some point during the evening, delgado and plascencia had a heated argument. flores, renteria, and edwin saw the two men interacting, but they did not hear what delgado and plascencia said to each other. renteria testified that delgado and plascencia spoke in raised voices and that the conversation had to intervene to calm the two men. 2. renteria renteria left the party, returned to the motel where he was staying, and went to sleep. later he received a call in which and asked where he was. plascencia told renteria he was watts. renteria went back to sleep. the next morning someone called renteria and said plascencia had been killed on anzac avenue. renteria drove lynwood and saw delgado sitting in his car. renteria said to later that day, detective john skaggs interviewed renteria. according to the detective, renteria told him the second call renteria received was from jesus cruz, known as 4 also according to detective skaggs, renteria said he confronted delgado, but delgado did not respond. 3. flores plascencia parked his red truck that evening in front of his went with flores to the party. leaving the party soon after renteria did, they drove to a drive-through fast food restaurant. while they were in the car, plascencia got a call from renteria, who wanted to know whether called. after leaving the fast food restaurant, flores noticed a car , and the other car stopped behind him. plascencia got out of plascencia was the car that had been following them and approached plascencia. responding, delgado pointed a gun at plascencia, fired, and missed. flores looked in the direction delgado had fired. when he looked back, he saw delgado shoot plascencia in the back of the head and plascencia fall to the ground. delgado leaned over plascencia and shot him again. delgado returned to his car and left. when police officers arrived, flores told one of the officers he had seen the shooting and knew who the shooter was. detective skaggs interviewed flores a few hours later. flores, the series of events from the time he arrived at the party to the time the officers responded to the shooting. flores explained at 5 trial that, although growing up he been taught not to snitch or talk to the police, he felt he had to tell the truth in this case because it was the right thing to do. flores admitted at trial he drank beer that evening and mine in the early morning before he went to work. a toxicologist called by delgado testified that using alcohol and methamphetamine together , and comprehension. 4. edwin edwin and delgado remained at the party after renteria, flores, and plascencia left. edwin testified that delgado said he wanted edwin to drive him to shoot plascencia. when edwin declined, delgado left and took the car. edwin called renteria and told him delgado was going to shoot plascencia. edwin testified that when delgado returned an hour later he had a revolver. edwin took the weapon, which contained four empty shell casings and one live round, flushed the shell casings down the toilet, and gave the gun to one of his cousins. detective skaggs interviewed edwin on july 9, 2006. edwin told the detective that delgado and plascencia had a uring the party and that delgado took his shirt off to fight, but the situation calmed down. edwin said flores and plascencia left the party together and, a few minutes later, delgado followed. edwin told detective skaggs that, when he asked delgado wherreturned. edwin asked delgado where he had been, but delgado did not respond. edwin also told detective skaggs that the 6 morning after the shooting renteria confronted delgado and said delgado said delgado at trial, however, edwin denied he saw renteria confront meanwhile, between the shooting in july 2006 and the time , and edwin was diagnosed with schizophrenia. a forensic psychologist called by the people testified tell the truth. the psychologist stated a person can test the by delgarecall and describe events that occurred before the onset of the condition. the physician also said she could corroborate any statements edwin made about his history by reference to known facts. b. ten years later, the jury convicts delgado of murdering plascencia law enforcement tried to find delgado in mexico for 10 home in whittier. his first trial, in august 2016, ended in a mistrial because the jury could not reach a verdict. the second trial was in february and march 2017, and the jury found delgado guilty of first degree murder. the trial court sentenced delgado to a prison term of 25 years to life, plus 25 years to life for the firearm enhancement, for a total prison term of 50 years to life. delgado timely appealed. 7 discussion a. the trial court did not make any prejudicial errors in its evidentiary rulings delgado argues the trial court abused its discretion in overruling his objections to the admission of several hearsay statements. in particular, delgado claims error in the admission of (1) the statement by edwin or someone else to renteria that n to plascencia; (3) the statement by edwin to detective skaggs that responses when they asked him about plascencdelgado also contends the trial court abused its discretion in allowing detective skaggs to give an opinion about whether statements by flores and edwin before trial were consistent with their testimony at trial. 1. standard of review we review for abuse of discretion the evidentiary rulings. (people v. powell (2018) 5 cal.5th 921, 951; people v. wall (2017) 3 cal.5th 1048, 1069.) an evidentiary error is reversible only where the defendant made a timely and specific objection and the error resulted in a miscarriage of justice. (evid. code,  353;1 see people v. sivongxxay (2017) 3 cal.5th 151, 178 1 undesignated statutory references are to the evidence code. 8 people v. earp admitted evidence should have been excluded on the ground stated and . . . the error or errors complained of resulted in a .) probable that a result more favorable to the appealing party would have been reached in the people v. blackburn (2015) 61 cal.4th 1113, 1146.) 2. as harmless delgado argues the trial court abused its discretion by the trial court ruled the statement was admissible for the nonhearsay purpose of showing renteria. (see people v. clark n out-of-court statement can be admitted for the nonhearsay purpose of showing that it imparted certain information to the hearer, and that the hearer, believing such information to be true, acted in conformity with such beliefpeople v. livingston (2012) 53 cal.4th 1145, 1162 [evidence of a statement that caused 9 is not hearsay, since it is the to be proved, not the truth of the matter asserted in the statement].) the trial court ruled the evidence someone called explained why renteria contacted plascencia and asked him where he was and whether he was okay. (see, e.g., livingston, at been relevant for the jury to understand why [the witness] and the other consistent with this ruling, is being offered for the limited purpose of showing its effect on the listener, mr. renteria, not for the truth of the matter asserted. so you will consider it only for its effect upon the delgado argues that, even if the people sought to introduce evidence of the statement for the nonhearsay purpose of explaining why renteria called plascencia, why renteria called hearsay objection to an out-of-court statement may not be overruled simply by identifying a nonhearsay purpose for admitting the statement. the trial court must also find that the nonhearsay purpose is relevant to an people v. riccardi (2012) 54 cal.4th 758, 814, disapproved on another ground in people v. rangel (2016) 62 cal.4th 1192, 1216; see people v. montes (2014) 58 cal.4th 809, ) evidence renteria received a call warning him that plascencia was in danger was relevant to explain why renteria called plascencia in the middle of the night to check on him, even 10 though renteria had just seen plascencia a few hours before and had no other reason to call him. it also tended to corroborate that plascencia received a call from renteria. as delgado correctly points out, however, the people could have proven those facts without also introducing the hearsay content of the call plascencia. (cf. people v. case (2018) 5 cal.5th 1, 32-33 [evidence the defendant bragged he was a bank robber and a convicted felon was relevant to explain what the person who heard the statement was doing and her motivation for doing itgoing to be somewhat difficult to swallow].)2 but even if the trial court abused its discretion in it is not reasonably probable the jury would have reached a result more 2 delgado also argues the trial court should have excluded the evidence under section 352. by not objecting under section 352 at trial, however, delgado forfeited the argument. (see  353, subd. (a); people v. valdez (2012) 55 cal.4th 82, 138 under . . . section 352 . . . defendant forfeited this argument by people v. panah (2005) 35 objection did not preserve an objection under section 352. (see people v. ervine did not preserve claidelgado subsequently moved for a mistrial in part on the ground the than probative, delgado does on his motion for a mistrial. 11 favorable to delgado had renteria not testified about the (entire content of the) call he received. as stated, the trial court instructed the jury to consider evidence of the statement only for the limited purpose of its effect on renteria. absent a showing to the contrary, which delgado has not made, we presume the jury understood and followed that instruction. (see people v. buenrostro (2018) 6 cal.5th 367, 431; people v. daveggio and michaud (2018) 4 cal.5th 790, 821.) indeed, the prosecutor did moreover, edwin testified, without any limiting instruction, about the same phone call. edwin stated that edwin stated that, after he refused and delgado left without him, the cellphone saying [delgado] was going to go over and shoot [plascencia]people v. bryant, smith and wheeler (2014) 60 cal.4th 335, 415 [any error in admitting hearsay statement was harmless where another people v. thomas by admitting one hearsay statement, but the error was harmless because its content was the same as other properly admitted finally, the evidence delgado killed plascencia was overwhelming. flores saw delgado, whom he had known for dy was lying in the street next to his red truck and a cup from the fast food restaurant, delgado shot plascencia. one bullet entered the left side of 12 plascencia and shot him in the back of the head. another bullet went through the middle of plasclung, and lodged in his lower back. flores testified that, after plascencia fell to the ground, delgado leaned over and shot him plascencia from behind, plascencia did not have any defensive wounds. the circumstantial evidence also pointed to delgado. edwin, although he did not witness the murder, saw delgado express anger toward plascencia, was asked to drive delgado to kill plascencia, and called renteria to warn him plascencia was in danger. edwin also testified that delgado returned 30 to 60 minutes later with a .38 caliber revolver and that edwin found and disposed of four expended bullet casings. consciousness of guilt. delgado was angry plascencia had been flirting with iris. when renteria confronted delgado after delgado fled to mexico and evaded efforts to capture him for almost 10 years. (see people v. gomez (2018) 6 cal.5th 243, 288 people v. powell becaerror in admitting the statement was harmless. (see people v. eubanks (2011) 53 cal.4th 110, 152 [any error in admission of in light of the overwhelming evidence defendant committed the murders]; people v. houston (2005) 130 cal.app.4th 279, 296 [erroneous admission of 13 hearsay is harmless where the evidence of guilt is overwhelming].) 3. the trial courtdetective s, edwin, and renteria told him in 2006 was either not error or harmless error after flores, renteria, and edwin testified and the trial court excused them, the prosecution called detective skaggs to testify in part about statements the three men made to him when he interviewed them in 2006. counsel for delgado objected: to have quite a few . . . hearsay statements from mr. flores and possibly other witnesses. i would ask the court to allow me to make a continuing hearsay and sixth amendment objection to told [detective] skaggs. mouth, because there were some prior consistent statements that [you] were challenging, and now there is prior inconsistent allowed in for different purposes, and i prefer the answer. continuing?

[] (b) an express or implied charge has been made that his testimony at the hearing is recently fabricated or is influenced by bias or other improper motive, and the statement was made before the bias, motive for fabrication, or other the trial court did not abuse its discretion. when cross-examining flores, counsel for delgado implied detective skaggs had coached flores on his trial testimony. counsel for delgado had asked flores several times whether flores met with detective skaggs in 2016, and flores refused or was very reluctant to answer. flores also admitted he had refused to meet with counsel for delgado or defense investigators. evidence of implied charge his trial testimony was influenced by improper coaching. (see people v. kopatz (2015) 61 cal.4th 62, 86 [prior consistent statements were admissible to rebut a charge the 15 witness fabricated his identification of the defendant after he saw people v. collins (2010) 49 cal.4th 175, 216 [prior consistent statements were admissible to rebut an implieinformation in a police report and coaching by the prosecutor b. detective skaggs testified about two statements edwin made during his 2006 interview. testimony that he saw delgado and plascencia talking but not fighting at the party, detective skaggs testified edwin told him regarding eto shoot plascencia, detective skaggs testified edwin told him that, when he (edwin) asked delgado where he was going, by a witness that is inconsistent with his or her trial testimony is admissible to establish the truth of the matter asserted in the statement under the conditions set forth people v. chism (2014) 58 cal.4th 1266, 1294; see people v. rices (2017) 4 cal.5th 49, 85 [a prior impeachment and evidence of a statement made by a witness is not made inadmissible by the hearsay rule if the statement is inconsistent with his testimony at the hearing section 770 extrinsic evidence of a statement made by a witness that is inconsistent with any part of his testimony at the hearing shall 16 be excluded unless: [] (a) the witness was so examined while testifying as to give him an opportunity to explain or deny the statement; or [] (b) the witness has not been excused from giving furth delgado argues the two statements edwin made to detective skaggs were inadmissible as prior inconsistent statements because edwin did not have an opportunity to admit or deny them. aents to detective skaggs, however, was harmless. even without testified at trial that part[delgado] c. renteria testified at trial that the morning after the party someone, perhaps cruz, called him and said plascencia was dead. detective skaggs subsequently testified renteria told him that [plascencia]. ruled the statement was admissible as a prior inconsistent statement. delgado argues the statements were consistent, not inconsistent. deduced from people v. cowan (2010) 50 cal.4th 401, 502.) of section 1235 is that the statement in fact be inconsistent 17 contradiction in express terms, is the test for admitting a people v. homick (2012) 55 cal.4th 816, 859; see in re bell (2017) 2 cal.5th 1300, 1307 contradiction between the testimony and the prior statement, it here, the two statements are more consistent than supplied, that cruz identified delgado as the killer, was consistenplascencia was dead. the statement that delgado killed testimony if, for example, renteria had testified cruz identified someone other than delgado as the perpetrator. but he did not. any error, however, was harmless. as discussed, the reasonably probable that, had the jurors not heard the statement detective skaggs attributed to renteria that cruz said delgado favorable to delgado. d. confronted him renteria confronted him. renteria testified at trial he confronted detective skaggs testified at trial, however, that in 2006 renteria told him that, when he confronted delgado, delgado did 18 not respond.3 and although edwin testified at trial he did not see renteria the morning after plascencia was killed, detective skaggs testified that in 2006 edwin told him that, when renteria delgado argues these prior inconsistent and inculpatory statements were inadmissible because renteria and edwin did not have an opportunity to explain or deny them. again, , any error was harmless. 4. atements by flores and edwin were consistent detective skaggs testified that he met with flores in 2016 to review his testimony and to ask what he remembered about statements in an interview with the detective and a prosecutor in improper for two reasons: 1) a jury does not need an expert to help it decide whether or not two statements are consistent; and 2) the prior statements/testimony were not in evidence. this improper expert opinion allowed the prosecution to bolster the delgado forfeited these arguments, however, 3 the trial court gave a jury instruction on adoptive admissions. 19 trial court overruled prior hearsay objections did not make it futile for delgado to object to detecthe statements by flores and edwin were consistent. the trial court did not criticize counsel for delgado for making objections, nor had the court suggested additional objections would be unwanted or unnecessary.
