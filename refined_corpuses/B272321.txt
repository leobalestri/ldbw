( 1202.4, subd. (d).) in the absence of a contrary showing, the court was entitled to presume that defendant would have the ability to pay the restitution fine from future wages, including those he would earn in prison. (people v. douglas (1995) 39 cal.app.4th 1385, 1397; people v. frye (1994) 21 cal.app.4th 1483, 1486-1487;  1202.4, subd. (d).) the 10-year statute of limitations on the enforcement of judgments does not apply to a restitution fine. ( 1214, subd. (e)(2); see people v. douglas, supra, at p. 1397.) we have examined the entire record and are satisfied that er responsibilities, and that no arguable issue exists. we conclude wende procedure and our review of the record, received adequate and effective appellate review of the judgment entered against him in this case.
