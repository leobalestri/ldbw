second degree robbery and attempted kidnapping to commit another crime. on appeal, defendant contends that the prosecutor engaged in misconduct by eliciting evidence of an uncharged crime and that, in the event his misconduct claim has been forfeited, his trial counsel provided him with ineffective assistance at trial. defendant also claims that he is entitled to one additional day of conduct credit. we hold that defendant forfeited his prosecutorial misconduct claim by failing to object to the uncharged crime testimony on the grounds of misconduct and failing to request an admonition. we further hold that, based on the record, we cannot determine defendant is entitled to one additional day of conduct credit. factual background1 defendant and appellant worked together at a gas station in pomona from approximately the beginning of april 2010 to the beginning of july 2010. on november 2, 2010, at approximately 11 p.m., padilla, who was working at the gas station alone, was cleaning the pumps outside. defendant, his face partially covered with a mask, approached padilla, threatened him, and told him to open the gas station store. padilla opened the door to the store and gave defendant, who was armed with a knife, the cash in the register. defendant then ordered padilla to a back room and told him that he was going to tie him up. padilla escaped and called 911. in his case, defendant presented testimony from his wife and mother-in-law that he was at home on the night of the robbery and through the morning after. 1 because we resolve this appeal on procedural grounds, we provide only a summary of the facts underlying the crimes charged to give context to the procedural background and discussion. 3 procedural background in an information, the los angeles county district attorney charged defendant in count one with second degree robbery in violation of penal code section 2112 and in count 2 with attempted kidnapping to commit another crime in violation of sections 664 and 209, subdivision (b)(1). the district attorney alleged as to both counts that defendant personally used a deadly weapon within the meaning of section 12022, subdivision (b)(1) and had been convicted of a prior serious or violent felony within the meaning of sections 667, subdivisions (b) through (i), 1170.12, subdivisions (a) through (d), and 667, subdivision (a)(1). following trial, the jury found defendant guilty on counts 1 and 2, but found the personal use of a deadly weapon allegation not true. defendant admitted the prior strike and prior serious felony conviction. at the sentencing hearing, the trial court sentenced defendant to an aggregate of 14 years comprised of a middle term sentence of seven years on count 2, doubled to 14 years based on the prior strike allegation, plus an additional five year term based on the prior serious felony conviction. pursuant to section 654, the trial court stayed the sentence on count 1. the trial court awarded defendant 348 days of presentence custody credit comprised of 304 days of actual custody credit and 44 days of conduct credit. discussion a. background asked whether he had any disagreements or fights with defendant. in response, padilla testified about an incident between him and defendant involving a bicycle and a third 2 all further statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise indicated. 4 third party concerning the bicycle incident.3 at a subsequent hearing involving section 402 motions, the prosecutor raised the issue about the bicycle, but informed the trial court that he did not intend to raise it with the jury. the trial court then asked defense counsel if they were going to raise the issue move at a hearing just prior to opening statements, defense counsel again raised the issue about the bicycle and informed the trial court that it was an issue defense counsel will allow] the jury [to] decide what weight to gdefense counsel agreed.4 during direct examination

[] [padilla]: yeah. [] [prosecutor]: what about? [] [padilla]: about a bike. [] [prosecutor]: okay. a bike? [] [padilla]: yeah. [] [prosecutor]: tell us, what happened in regards to a 3 details about the nature of the incident. 4 defendant contends that during this hearing, one of his attorneys informed the trial the issue could be weighed by the jury. 5 bike? [] [padilla]: [a man] that used to live next door in the motel. he had left his bike, like, in the gas station. and [defendant] got it, and i was leaving. and [defendant] told me he was going to take care of itkeep it for [the man] so he could give it to him, like, in the morning when [the man] got off. [] and afterafterlike, when i went back to work, the [man] told me he [had not] seen his bike. [] [defense counsel]: objection. hearsay. [] [the court]: question is not hearsay. overruled.

[] [the court]: see counsel sidebar. court reporter at the side bar conference the trial court and counsel engaged in the following the vehicle, that being this witness on direct, given hishisnot the sharpest pencil in also, the danger of introducing prior acts of the defendant amounting to a crime. sounds like [evidence code section] 1101(b) to me. [] [prosecutor]: okay. [] [the court]: ithe advantage of cross-examination is being able to ask leading questions. the set this-- you have the kind of witness who can pick up the cues, and has this witness been admonished in terms of what he iscan and cannot touch. basically saying he sold a the jury to consider that for? so he happened to steal a bike but his dispute was 6 something else. the dispute was what? [] [prosecutor]: thewell, couple of things. one iswhat are you offering it for? -- [] [the court]: i know. but what is the nature of the dispute? what was the deal between the understanding from the [preliminary hearing] transcript is that somehow because of his knowledge of the bike, the witnewitness of ratting the defendant out to some guy who lives in the motel and this is the basis for why the defense [filed a section 402 motion regarding] this issue with the bike defendant believes that this victim rattedthe victim ratted him out. [] [the court]: welin which [] [defense counsel]: i do want to, one, address the leading questioning by counsel of the prosecutor did not mention the bicycle incident during his initial argument, but defense counsel raised it in her argument, suggesting that it showed padtoward defendant and gave padilla a motive to misidentify defendant as the perpetrator. misidentified defendant as the perpetrator as a result of the bicycle incident. following a sidebar conference, the prosecutor resumed rebuttal argument and pointed out to the jury that defense counsel was complaining, on the one hand, that the argument between padilla and defendant had not been fully explained, but on the other hand, that defense counsel did not ask padilla for details about the argument when she had the opportunity to do so. 7 b. forfeiture defendant contends that the prosecutor engaged in misconduct when he elicited on direct examination of padilla testimony that suggested defendant, by selling the bicycle, stole it. the prosecutor counters, inter alia, that defendant forfeited the misconduct claim by failing to object to the testimony on the basis of misconduct and failing to request a curative admonition. defendant must make a timely and specific objection and ask the trial court to admonish people v. cole (2004) 33 cal.4th 1158, 1201 [17 cal.rptr.3d 532, 95 p.3d 811].) the failure to timely object and request an admonition will be excused if doing either would have been futile, or if an admonition would not have cured the harm. (ibid.; people v. hill (1998) 17 cal.4th 800, 820 [72 people v. clark (2011) 52 cal.4th 856, 960.) defendant concedes that his trial counsel did not object to the uncharged crime testimony5 or request a curative admonition, but argues those failures should be excused because an objection under the circumstances would have been futile and because an admonition would not have cured the prejudice that resulted from the testimony. we disagree. ject to the uncharged crime testimony based on prosecutorial misconduct. once padilla testified testimony on the issue might elicit evidence of an uncharged crime, so it cut off further testimony on the issue and conducted a side bar conference. during the conference, of eliciting inadmissible evidence of an uncharged crime, he had not yet done so. 5 although it is unclear whetbicycle raised a reasonable inference that, in doing so, defendant stole it, we will assume without deciding that it potentially raised such an inference and therefore refer to that 8 prosecutor had already engaged in misconduct by eliciting testimony from which the jurors could infer that defendant stole the bicycle when he sold it, the trial court could have addressed the issue. thus, a timely objection would not necessarily have been futile. similarly, it is not evident from the record that an admonition would not have cured any potential prejudice from the uncharged crime testimony. to the contrary, as with the trial court during the side bar conference, the court may have been able to fashion an admonition advising the jurors to disregard any negative inference that may request such a curative admonition forfeited the issue on appeal. c. ineffective assistance of counsel defendant contends that if his prosecutorial misconduct claim was forfeited at trial, his defense counsel provided ineffective assistance of counsel. according to defendant, his trial counsel had no reasonable basis for the failing to object to the testimony and request an admonition. measured against the standard of a reasonably competent deficient performance resulted in prejudice undermined the proper functioning of the adversarial process that the trial cannot be people v. kipp (1998) 18 cal.4th 349, 366 [75 cal.rptr.2d 716, 956 p.2d 1169], quoting strickland v. washington [(1984)] 466 u.s. [668,] 686.) preliminarily, we note that rarely will an appellate record establish ineffective assistance of counsel. (people v. mendoza tello (1997) 15 cal.4th 264, 267-people v. thompson (2010) 49 cal.4th 79, 122.) 9 here the record establishes that there might have been a reasonable tactical basis for not objecting to the uncharged crime testimony. prior to trial, defendacounsel twice indicated that defendant intended to raise the issue about the dispute between defendant and padilla over the bicycle to show bias. after the prosecutor l made no objection and instead argued to the jury that the dispute over the bicycle may have biased padilla against defendant and resulted in padilla misidentifying him as the perpetrator. cle; he testified that have determined that the potential prejudice from that testimony was questionable, at best, and that the potential benefit from arguing the bias issue outweighed any such potential prejudice. because we cannot conclude from the record that no reasonable attorney would have failed to object and request an admonition under the circumstances, we cannot resolve the ineffective assistance claim on appeal. d. conduct credit defendant contends, and the attorney general agrees, that defendant was entitled to 45 days of conduct credit instead of the 44 days he was awarded by the trial court. according to defendant, because he was convicted of a violent felony, he was subject to the 15 percent limitation on presentence conduct credit set forth in section 2933.1. by the number of days of actual custody creditis 45 days. therefore, defendant maintains he is entitled to one additional day of conduct credit. we agree with the parties that defendant is entitled to 45 days of custody credit. 10 disposition the judgment of conviction is affirmed and the matter is remanded to the trial court with instructions to correct the abstract of judgment to reflect that defendant is entitled to 45 days of conduct credit, in addition to 304 days of actual custody credit, for a total award of 349 days of presentence custody credit. mosk, j. we concur: turner, p. j. kriegler, j.
