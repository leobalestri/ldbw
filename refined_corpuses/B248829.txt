(b)(1); counts 1, 3, & 4),1 and three counts of oral copulation/sexual penetration with a child under the age of 10 ( 288.7, subd. (b); counts 2, 5, & 6). appellant pleaded not guilty. appellant was represented by deputy public defender lizandro salas at his preliminary hearing. deputy public defender tammy l. landeros later became new counsel pursuant to people v. marsden (1970) 2 cal.3d 118 (marsden). following a hearing, the court denied the motion. on december 17, 2012, trial was set for january 2, 2013. at a later court date, appellant indicated he had retained private counsel, but when the public defender contacted private counsel, she was informed that he had not yet been retained. on the date set for trial, january 2, private counsel appeared. appellant sought to relieve his public defender and to substitute private counsel. private counsel stated he was not ready for trial and sought a continuance. the prosecutor objected, based on the age of 1 all further statutory citations are to the penal code. 3 the case, the stress on the victim, the fact that the case had been set for trial, and the fact that there had been five prior continuances. the court denied appellant motion, and the matter was trailed for trial the next day. on january 3, 2013, private counsel again appeared. the prosecutor and public defender announced ready for trial. appellant was offered and rejected a final plea bargain. appellant again sought to substitute private counsel for his public defender. the court denied the motion. appellant made another marsden motion, which was heard and denied. a jury found appellant guilty of all charges. trial, based on the denial of his motion to substitute counsel and ineffective assistance of trial counsel, was heard and denied. appellant was sentenced to a term of 30 years to life in state prison: 10 years each on counts 1, 3, and 4, to run consecutively, plus concurrent 15-year-to-life terms on counts 2, 5, and 6. appellant timely noticed an appeal from the judgment of conviction. factual background2 amber first met appellant, a bus driver, in 2006 when she began riding on his bus line. amber and her husband trusted appellant with their children. appellant would come over almost every weekend: amber would do her children. atestified that appellant began molesting her multiple times during the prior year. appellant after e. informed her mother amber, e. was taken to the hospital and police station. at the police station, e. spoke with an officer about the molestation. 2 we limit our discussion of the facts to those relevant to the issues on appeal. 4 appellant presented no defense evidence. discussion appellant contends the trial court committed reversible error when it denied and/ofurther contends his convictions should be reversed, as defense counsel rendered ineffective assistance at trial. a. right to counsel of choice right to the eencompasses the right to retain counsel of opeople v. courts (1985) 37 cal.3d 784, 789 (courts), quoting people v. holland (1978) 23 cal.3d 77, 86.) necessary corollary [of the right] is that a defendant must be given a reasonable opportunity to employ and consult with counsel; otherwise, the right to be heard by counsel would be of little worth. [citations.] in addition, couonce retained, [must be] given a reasonable time in which to prepare the [citatcourts, supra, at p. 790.) he right to such s of substantial importance, such as that seeking to ensure orderly and expeditious judicial administration, with a view toward an accommodation reasonable under the facts of the particular (ibid., quoting people v. byoune (1966) 65 cal.2d 345, 346.) accordingly, continuance may be denied if the accif he arbitrarily chooses to substitute counsel at the time of courts, supra, at pp. 790-791, quoting people v. byoune, supra, at pp. 346-347.) for example, where a request for a continuance is made on the eve of trial, day of trial or second day of trial, the lateness of the continuance request justified a denial, absent compelling circumstances to the contrary. (courts, at p. 792, fn. 4 [citing cases].) 5 counsel and to continue the trial, which were made on the eve of trial and the day trial commenced, as appellant presented no compelling reason to justify his delay in seeking to substitute counsel. appellant first expressed dissatisfaction with his appointed counsel on november 21, 2012, but waited until the eve of trial -- six weeks later -- to substitute private counsel, who was not prepared to go to trial. appellant provided no explanation for the delay. moreover, granting the motion to substitute counsel would have required -- as appellant concedes on appeal -- a continuance of several weeks. the trial court properly considered the adverse administration of justice, as the prosecution and its witnesses were ready for trial. finally, alleged incompetency of counsel, as detailed below, the record demonstrates no incompetence of defense counsel. accordingly, the court did not err in denying to continue the trial. b. ineffective assistance of counsel appellant next contends the trial court erred in denying his motion for a new trial, as his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance. he contends (1) that defense counsel should have obtained video-recordings from the security cameras in the laundromat (where the jury found one incident of molestation occurred), and (2) that counsel should have contacted four witnesses who would have provided evidence supporting a theory that e.continually rejected her advances. in order to prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, appellant must show (1) of 6 reasonableness under prevailing professional norms, and (2) that there is a reasonable probability that rors, the result would have been more favorable to the defendant. (strickland v. washington (1984) 466 u.s. 668, 687-688; people v. gray (2005) 37 cal.4th 168, 206-207; people v. kelly (1992) 1 cal.4th 495, 519-520.) s reasons for conducting the defense case in a particular way are not readily apparent from the record, we will not assume inadequacy of representation unless there could have for cos actions.people v. earp (1999) 20 cal.4th 826, 896.) here, appellant has shown nan objective standard of reasonableness, nor that there is a reasonable probability alleged errors, the result would have been more favorable to him. first, although there was some evidence of video surveillance at the laundromat, there is no evidence that video-recordings for the specific time, date and location of the molestation incident actually existed. appellant provided no evidence that they did. indeed, defense counsel made the tactical decision to argue second, as to the failure to contact witnesses who would have impeached , defense counsel asserted that she had interviewed several potential defense witnesses, including at least one of the witnesses named by appellant. counsel stated that she decided for tactical reasons not to call the witness, as she he merely testified that e. it was e. herself who t, and it was her testimony the jury credited. thus, 7 have resulted in a more favorable outcome for appellant. in sum, appellant has not shown ineffective assistance of counsel. accordingly, the trial court did not err in disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. manella, j. we concur: willhite, acting p. j. edmon, j.* ________________________________________________________________________ * judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
