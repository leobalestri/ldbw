(mendoza, supra, 5 cal.app.5th at p. 537.) the defendant appealed, challenging the trial authority to resentence him in case a, which was not the subject of his proposition 47 petition. the mendoza court upheld the we hold that when a trial court grants proposition 47 relief for a subordinate term, the court may resentence the defendant on any component of the aggregate term.(mendoza, supra, 5 cal.app.5th at p. 537.) the court explained: when a trial court grants proposition 47 relief on an eligible felony offense, it resentences the defendant to a misdemeanor.

(id. at p. 538.) appellant contends the trial court failed to consider his aggregate sentence at the hearing on july 28, 2016, but that is wrong. the court made it clear that it was resentencing appellant for the entire case, telling him -sentence the court addressed all sentencing components of count 1, the sentence in count 2, and whether the sentence in count 2 should be consecutive or concurrent to the sentence in count 1. the court double-checked aspects of the sentence, and it awarded custody credits and ordered appellant to provide samples and pay 6 fees and fines as required by law. the court fully addressed all as unhappiness with the result. the court reduced his overall sentence from 19 years and four months to 19 years, but appellant contends it should have been reduced even more. the during the july 28, 2016 hearing that it remembered the case and appellant. the court also demonstrated a clear recollection it explained the reasons for imposing a consecutive sentence. sentence, this indicates that the court fully considered all relevant circumstances in arriving at an overall sentence of 19 years. under these circumstances, the court exercised appropriate sentencing discretion. (see people v. superior court (alvarez) (1997) 14 cal.4th 968, 977-978 [ the burden is on the party attacking the sentence to clearly show that the sentencing decision was irrational or arbitrary. in the absence of such a showing, the trial court is presumed to have acted to achieve legitimate sentencing objectives, and its discretionary determination to impose a particular sentence will not be set aside on review. ].) review on appeal we have examined the entire record and are satisfied appellate responsibilities.
