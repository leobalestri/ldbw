[citations.] we presume in support of the judgment the existence of every fact the trier could reasonably deduce from the evidence. [citation.] [] the same standard of review applies to cases in which the prosecution relies primarily on circumstantial evidence and to special circumstance allegations. [citation.] [i]f the circumstances reasonably justify the jurys findings, the judgment may not be reversed simply because the circumstances might also reasonably be reconciled with a contrary finding. [citation.] we do not reweigh evidence or reevaluate a witnesss credibility. [citations.] (people v. nelson (2011) 51 cal.4th 198, 210 [internal quotation marks omitted].) appellant knocked b. to the ground and attempted to pull down her pants. she held onto her pants and prevented him from pulling them down. he fled when there were sounds of someone approaching. b. estimated that the struggle lasted two minutes. appellant was later apprehended by the police and told them he was horny. it is more than reasonable to infer from these circumstances that appellant knocked the victim to the ground and attempted to pull the victims pants down because he intended to rape her. rape is the most obvious reason to remove a victims pants. appellant contends correctly, that there is evidence that he said he wanted to feel up the victim who had a big ass. there is, however, no evidence that he made any attempt to touch the victim on her bottom through her clothing or to insert his hands into her pants. while it is possible that appellant struggled with the victim for two minutes attempting to remove her pants simply to feel her up, it is a less obvious inference. even assuming a jury could reasonably have found that appellants intent was only to touch the victim on her bottom and so he had no intent to commit rape, that circumstance does not require reversal of the judgment. (people v. nelson, supra, 51 cal.4th at p. 210 [if the circumstances reasonably justify the jurys findings, the judgment may not be reversed simply because the circumstances might also reasonably be reconciled with a contrary finding].) 5 appellant contends that people v. greene (1973) 34 cal.app.3d 622 (greene) and people v. mullen (1941) 45 cal.app.2d 297 (mullen) show that there is insufficient evidence to support his conviction. in greene, the defendant put his arm around the defendants waist, said he just wanted to play with her and moved his hand up and down the victims waist. the victim broke free and ran away. (greene, supra, 34 cal.app.3d at pp. 629, 650-655.) touching a victim through her clothing in the waist area is a much less direct indication of an intent to commit sexual penetration of the victim than is violently attempting to remove the clothing of a victim which covers her genital area. thus, the fact that the defendants touching in greene was not sufficient to show intent to commit rape is of no assistance in evaluating appellants intent in attempting to remove b.s pants. the opinion in mullen, supra, 45 cal.app.2d 297, is likewise of no assistance.2 the defendant in that case did remove the victims clothing in order to touch her breasts and private parts, but ultimately released her without raping her. the court held that [w]hatever the extent and however rough the fondling of the woman, if her pursuer without fear of interruption voluntarily abandons his endeavor to ravish her sexual organs, then the force he employed was not an assault with intent to commit rape. (id. at p. 300.) here, appellant did not abandon his planes, but was interrupted. appellant also cites numerous cases in which the court of appeal found sufficient evidence to support a conviction for assault with intent to commit rape.3 he contends all of those cases involve significant additional acts not present in this case. we do not 2 respondent notes that people v. mullen, supra, 45 cal.app.4th 297, has been severely criticized. (see people v. trotter (1984) 160 cal.app.3d 1217, 1222-1223 & fn. 1.) we agree with those criticisms. however, as we discuss, even if we take mullen at face value, it is of no assistance to appellant. 3 people v. bard (1968) 70 cal.2d 3; people v. nye (1951) 38 cal.2d 34; people v. dyser (2012) 202 cal.app.4th 1015; people v. leal (2009) 180 cal.app.4th 782; people v. dixon (1999) 75 cal.app.4th 935; people v. craig (1994) 25 cal.app.4th 1593; people v. bradley (1993) 15 cal.app.4th 1144; people v. martinez (1985) 171 cal.app.3d 727; people v. trotter (1984) 160 cal.app.3d 1217; people v. elder (1969) 274 cal.app.2d 381; people v. clifton (1967) 248 cal.app.2d 126. 6 agree that all the cases involve significant additional acts. further, when an appellate court decide[s] issues of sufficiency of evidence, comparison with other cases is of limited utility, since each case necessarily depends on its own facts. (people v. thomas (1992) 2 cal.4th 489, 516.) 2. custody credit respondent contends the trial court erroneously awarded appellant one extra day of custody credit. we agree. the trial court found that appellant had 579 days of actual custody, and awarded him 87 days of conduct credit for a total of 666 days. appellant was convicted of a violent felony and so his conduct credit is calculated at 15 percent. ( 667.5 subd. (c)(15); 2933.1.) fifteen percent of 579 is 86.85, which must be rounded down to 86. (see people v. ramos (1996) 50 cal.app.4th 810, 815-817.) thus, appellants total award of presentence custody credits should be 665 days. we order the judgment modified and the abstract of judgment corrected to reflect this amount. (see people v. fitzgerald (1997) 59 cal.app.4th 932, 935-936 [receipt of excess presentence conduct credit is jurisdictional error].) 3. abstract of judgment respondent contends that the abstract of judgment mistakenly shows that appellant was convicted by plea. respondent is correct. appellant was convicted by a jury. we order the abstract of judgment corrected to reflect this fact. (see people v. boyde (1988) 46 cal.3d 212, 256.) disposition the judgment is modified to award appellant 665 days of presentence custody credit. the abstract of judgment is ordered corrected to show 665 days of credit and to show that appellant was convicted by a jury. the clerk of the superior court is instructed 7 to prepare an amended abstract of judgment reflecting these changes and to deliver a copy to the department of corrections and rehabilitation. the judgment of conviction is affirmed in all other respects. not to be published in the official reports mink, j.* we concur: turner, p.j. mosk, j. * retired judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
