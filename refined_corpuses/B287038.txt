counts of robbery, one count of possession of a firearm by a felon, and three counts of dissuading a witness, together with true findings on various firearm and gang enhancements. on appeal, linares challenges the his gang enhancement and contends the trial court committed a variety of sentencing errors. enhancements under penal code section 667, subdivision (a)1 and order the clerk of the superior court to amend the abstracts of judgment. background shortly before 11:00 p.m. on june 24, 2014, cameras recorded linares approaching a mobile taco stand at the corner of olympic boulevard and mirasol street. linares ordered three tacos from juan bernal, who was running the stand. after he received his tacos, linares complained to bernal about the amount of meat on them. bernal refunded linares for his meal. during their interaction, linares asked bernal if bernal knew the video showed linares returning to his vehicle and talking to his passenger, katherynne turcios. linares donned a taco stand. brandishing a firearm, linares told demanded 1 further references are to the penal code unless otherwise noted. 3 register. linares also took money from luis flores, a customer at the taco stand. turcios had moved from the passenger car. linares fired the gun twice at the taco stand as turcios drove away, hitting the stand with one of the shots. shortly after driving away from the taco stand, turcios drove the car into an intersection and was involved in a collision. turcios and linares fled on foot and police apprehended them shortly thereafter. at trial, a gang expert testified that both turcios and linares are members of a street gang known as varrio nueva estrada (vne). the people filed an information on july 16, 2015, charging linares with two counts of robbery (count 1 for bernal and count 2 for flores) under section 211, one count of possession of a firearm by a felon (count 6) under section 29800, subdivision (a)(1), and three counts of dissuading a witness (count 7 for bernal, count 8 for flores, and count 9 for guzman) under section 136.1, subdivision (a)(1).2 the information also alleged that coundirection of, and in association with a criminal street gang with the specific intent to promote, further and assist in criminal 2 during argument regarding jury instructions (after the parties rested, but before closing argument), the trial court to proof to reflect that counts 7, 8, and 9 charged linares with violations of section 136.1, subdivision (b)(1) rather than (a)(1). 4 (b)(1)(c).3 the last page of the information contained the following two paragraphs: offense or offenses alleged in counts one, two, five, and six, the defendant, walter rumaldo linares had been convicted of the following serious and/or violent felonies, as defined in penal code section 667(d) and penal code section 1170.12(b), and is thus subject to sentencing pursuant to the provisions of penal code section 667(b)-that paragraph was followed by a single allegation of a violation of section 211 with a conviction date of march 24, 2011 in los angeles superior court case no. ba375351. offense or offenses alleged in counts 1, 2, 5, 7, 8, and 9, the defendant, walter rumaldo linares had been convicted of the following two or more serious and/or violent felonies, as defined in penal code section 667(d) and penal code section of violations of section 211 with a conviction date of march 4, 2011 in los angeles superior court case no. ba375351. linares pled not guilty and the case proceeded to trial. following trial, the jury returned a verdict on march 9, finding the defendant guilty on all counts, and finding true all of the firearm and gang enhancement allegations. at a court trial 3 linares was also charged with attempted carjacking under sections 664 and 215, subdivision (a), and leaving the scene of an accident under vehicle code section 20001, subdivision (a). those charges were dismissed before trial. 5 onvictions, the trial court found that linares had been convicted of two separate counts under section 211 on march 24, 2011. linares moved pursuant to people v. superior court (romero) (1996) 13 cal.4th 497 (romero) and section 1385 to strike one of lin and the gang enhancement, and to run sentencing on all charges concurrently. th. on december 5, 2017, the trial court sentenced linares. for counts 1 and 2, the trial court selected the high term of five years, added 20 years for the firearm enhancement, added 10 years for the gang enhancement, and a five year prior serious felony enhancement under section 667, subdivision (a) for a minimum term of 40 years under the three strikes law and an additional determinate term of 20 years for the firearm enhancement and five years for the prior serious felony enhancement.4 ( 213, subd. (a)(2), 12022.53, subd. (c), 186.22, subd. (b)(1)(c), 667.5, subd. (c)(9), 667, subd. (a), 1170.12, subd. (b)(2)(a)(iii).) the total sentence was 40 years to life plus 25 years for each of counts 1 and 2. on count 6, the trial court sentenced linares to six years in state prison, stayed pursuant to section 654. on each of counts 7, 8, and 9, the trial court sentenced linares to 25 years to life plus five years for the prior serious felony enhancement under section 667, subdivision (a), 4 the trial court erroneously stated on the record that the minimum term for the indeterminate sentence was based on a 25 year firearm enhancement, which would have made the minimum term of each of counts 1 and 2 45 years. the trial correctly reflect the 20 year term required by section 12022.53, subdivision (c), making the minimum term 40 years. 6 but stayed the sentence on counts 7 and 8 under section 654. al court did not impose the gang enhancements, but noted that linares would have a minimum parole eligibility of 15 years under section 186.22, subdivision (b)(5). was 105 years to life plus 55 years. linares filed a timely notice of appeal. discussion a gang enhancement finding enhancement is not supported by sufficient evidence for two reasons. first, he contends, there is insufficient evidence to gang as that term is used in section 186.22. second, according to linares, there is insufficient evidence to support a finding that intent to promote, further, or assist in any criminal conduct by we disagree. when an appellant challenges the sufficiency of the evidethe light most favorable to the judgment to determine whether it discloses substantial evidencethat is, evidence that is reasonable, credible, and of solid valuefrom which a reasonable trier of fact could find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable people v. stanley we must ensure the evidence is reasonable, credible, and of solid value, nonetheless it is the exclusive province of the trial judge or jury to determine the credibility of a witness and the truth or 7 falsity of the people v. jones (1990) 51 cal.3d 294, 314.) function to reassess the credibility of the witneid. at pp. 314-315.) (people v. zamudio (2008) 43 cal.4th 327, 357 (zamudio).) accept logical inferences that the jury might have drawn from the duty to acquit a defendant if it finds the circumstantial evidence susceptible of two reasonable interpretations, one of which suggests guilt and the other innocence, it is the jury, not the appellate court that must be convinced of threasonably be reconciled with a contrary finding does not warrant zamudio, supra, 43 cal.4th at pp. 357-358.) linares contends that there is insufficient evidence in the record to support a determination that vne is a criminal street in re alexander l. (2007) 149 cal.app.4th 605, 610-611 (alexander l.).) at trial, los angeles police department officer aldo quintero testified as jury about his years of experiencefrom 2011 through trialstudying los angeles street gangs, and speaking with and arresting gang members. 8 quintero discussed his assignments that included years of work with gang members from the vne gang, and his personal knowledge about vne, the people specifically askedand quintero specifically answered the evidenchis knowledge specifically of vne is the type of evidence our supreme court subdivision (f) of section (people v. gardeley (1996) 14 cal.4th 605, 620, disapproved on other grounds in people v. sanchez (2016) 63 cal.4th 665, 686, fn. 13.) the alexander l. court was critical of the foundation of the expert witness(alexander l., supra, 149 cal.app.4th at p. 612.) here, the people did elicit that information from quintero, and his opinion rimary activities therefore consitutes sufficient nding on the gang enhancement. linares also argues that the record contains insufficient the directiointent to promote, further, or assist in any criminal conduct by we disagree. was also a vne member. the evidence in this case reflected , as well as to between the time bernal 9 at gunpointfor all of the money in the cash register, linares and told his . the evidence in the record is sufficient both that linares committed his offenses for the benefit of vne and with the specific intent to promote criminal conduct by vne gang members. b. pleading and sentencing errors linares contends that his sentence is inconsistent with the pleadings in four material ways. first, he contends the trial court erred by imposing the section 667, subdivision (a) prior serious felony enhancement because that enhancement was not alleged in the information. second, he contends that the trial court erred by sentencing this case as a third strike case because, he contends, the information only charged the case as a second strike case. third, linares contends that the trial court erred when it sentenced counts 7, 8, and 9 under the three strikes law because that sentencing scheme was only alleged as to counts 1, 2, 5, and 6. fourth, linares contends that the trial court erred in applying gang enhancements, both to counts 7 and 8, even section 654, and to calculate the minimum sentence on the indeterminate term imposed for counts 1 and 2. 1. section 667, subdivision (a) linares contends the trial court erred by using a prior serious felony conviction under section 667, subdivision (a) to calculate the minimum sentence on the indeterminate term on counts 1, 2, and 9, and by separately imposing the five-year serious felony conviction enhancement to the determinate term 10 on counts 1 and 2. citing people v. nguyen (2017) 18 cal.app.5th 260 (nguyen), linares contends that the enhancement must be struck because even though the facts supporting the enhancement were alleged, section 667, subdivision (a) was not cited anywhere in the information. the people argue that nguyen is distinguishable. linares was on notice of the enhancement, the people contend, because his counsel mentioned the possibility of a plea deal that included a five-year enhancement. in nguyen, according to the people, that never happened. we agree with linares. we do not know whether the defendant in nguyen -year prior serious felony ilar words before the trial in that case. the operative nucleus of nguyen for our purposes here is its necessarily also a strike prior. [citations.] charging language which expressly states that a fact is alleged to invoke one particular statute does not adequately inform the accused that (nguyen, supra, 18 cal.app.5th at pp. 266-267.) where the consequence to the defendant is five additional years of incarceration for each count for which it is alleged, it is not too much to ask that the people invoke section 667, subdivision (a), or, as nguyen related, include some language that clarifies that the inclusion of the allegation serves as an invocation of the prior serious felony conviction enhancement. we will, therefore, strike the section 667, subdivision (a) enhancement from counts 1, 2, and 9. 11 2. three strikes law allegations because of the way the information was pled, linares (again citing nguyen) makes contentions similar to those he three strikes law allegations. the last page of the information contained the following two paragraphs: r alleged that prior to the commission of that offense or offenses alleged in counts one, two, five, and six, the defendant, walter rumaldo linares had been convicted of the following serious and/or violent felonies, as defined in penal code section 667(d) and penal code section 1170.12(b), and is thus subject to sentencing pursuant to the provisions of penal code section 667(b)-that paragraph was followed by a single allegation of a violation of section 211 with a conviction date of march 24, 2011 in los angeles superior court case no. ba375351. offense or offenses alleged in counts 1, 2, 5, 7, 8, and 9, the defendant, walter rumaldo linares had been convicted of the following two or more serious and/or violent felonies, as defined in penal code section 667(d) and penal code section of violations of section 211 with a conviction date of march 4, 2011 in los angeles superior court case no. ba375351. based on those two paragraphs, linares contends that the case should only have been charged as a second strike case, and not a third strike case (because there is only one strike prior allege-(j) two listed under the following 12 the critical distinction between the information as it pertains to the section 667, subdivision (a) allegations and the three strikes law allegations is that the information specifically invokes the three strikes law. although the allegations invoking sections 667 and 1170.12 are not a model of clarity, the information does allege that the defendant had committed two crimes that constituted strikes prior and that the people intended to prosecute the case under the statutory scheme outlined in sections 667, subdivisions (b) through (j) and 1170.12. in addition to the inartfully worded allegations in the preliminary hearing that all parties understood the case to have been charged as a third-strike case. at the preliminary hearing, the pdefendant linares, so that he knows, i have been informed by my office that this is a third-strike case . . . . so we are going to proceed as a third-strike case. [] so [mr. linares] is facing 25 it does not appear from the record before us that there could have been any confusion about whether the people intended to charge linares under the three strikes law. 3. gang enhancements linares contends the trial court erred by imposing gang enhancements to counts 7 and 8 and by using gang indeterminate terms on counts 1 and 2. linares contends that the trial court erred by imposing a gang enhancement to the life sentences on counts 7 and 8, and by using the gang enhancement 13 to calculate the minimum term on the indeterminate sentences (even though the enhancement was not imposed on the determinate term) for counts 1 and 2. as to counts 1 and 2, the trial court did not impose the gang enhancement. rather, it calculated the minimum term of the indeterminate sentence using the gang enhancement, as required by sections 667, subdivision (e)(2)(a)(iii) and 186.22, subdivision (b)(4)(a). as to counts 7 and 8, the people contend that the trial court misspoke on the record when it purported to impose the gang enhancement, but was in fact adding a section 667 prior serious felony enhancement, as reflected in both the minute order noting t of judgment. citing people v. sharret (2011) 191 cal.app.4th 859 (sharret), linares contends that the trial court actually imposed the gang enhancement discrepancy with the minutes or the aid. at p. 864.) sharret derived that rule from, among other places, the people v. delgado (2008) 43 cal.4th 1059. delgado abstract of judgment is not itself the judgment of conviction, and to the extent the two conflict. [citations.] however, the abstract is a contemporaneous, statutorily sanctioned, officially prepared clerical record of the conviction and sentence. it may serve as the order committing the defendant to prison [citation]process and authority for carrying the judgment and sentence to [accuratel 14 prepared by the court clerk, at or near the time of judgment, as part of his or her official duty, it is cloaked with a presumption of id. at p. 1070, original italics.) our supreme court has also written that resolution of as in this case, the record is in conflict it will be harmonized if possible; but where this is not possible that part of the record will prevail, which, because of its origin and nature or otherwise, is entitled to greater credence [citation]. therefore whether the contrary people v. smith (1983) 33 cal.3d 596, 599.) our review of the record here reveals two things. first, the trial court misspoke when it imposed a five year enhancement on each of counts 7 and 8 the trial court used the same terminology on counts 7, 8, and 9 (and stayed the sentences on counts 7 and 8) before correcting itself mid-statement when pronouncing sentence on count 9additional five years on the gang i am sorry, an additional five years on the serious felony conviction prior, for a total of 25 to life, second, the abstract of judgment. there would thus be nothing for us to correct had the trial court actually imposed a gang enhancement on counts 7 and 8. 15 because we have already determined that the information did not charge linares for the five year prior serious felony enhancement, we will strike that enhancement from each of the sentences on counts 7, 8, and 9. for the sentences that the trial court did impose (and not stay), it did not impose a gang enhancement, but rather, pursuant to section 186.22, subdivision (b)(5), correctly announced that linares would not be eligible for parole for a minimum of 15 years. application of section 186.22 in this case. c. the trial court did not abuse its discretion by romero motion or to strike gang enhancements linares contends the trial court abused its discretion when romero motion by not striking one of linares also contends that the trial court abused its discretion by declining to strike gang enhancements pursuant to section 1385. in exercising its discretion under romero vacate a prior serious and/or violent felony conviction allegation consider whether, in light of the nature and circumstances of his present felonies and prior serious and/or violent felony convictions, and the particulars of his background, character, and prospects, the defendant may be deemed outside the [statutory] as though he had not previously been convicted of one or more people v. williams (1998) 17 cal.4th 148, 161.) 1385, the [trial] court should consider the nature and 16 circumstances of the prior convictions, and the particulars of his or her background, people v. orabuena (2004) 116 cal.app.4th 84, 98.) the trial court considered the factors it was required to consider when it declined to strike either a prior felony conviction or the gang enhancements. the trial court specifically noted that it had discretion, and that it had used that discretion in the past under appropriate circumstances, but that it was declining to do so in this instance, and it stated a variety of reasons for its under romero. what the trial court cited as most persuasive was that linares was released from prison after serving time for robbery and within months committed the additional robberies at turned around from the time he was to be rehabilitated in state prison and came out and chose to go right back into a life of exists a reasonable or fairly debatable justification under the law decision falls within the permissible range of options set by the cahill v. san diego gas & elec. co. ibid.) linares has not done so here; on the record before us, the trial permissible range of options. 17 d. resentencing under senate bill no. 6205 linares argues that we must remand the case to give the trial court the opportunity to exercise its discretion in the first instance to strike the firearm enhancement used to calculate the counts 1 and 2, and also imposed as part of the determinate sentences on both of those counts. on october 11, 2017 (before linares was sentenced on december 5, 2017), the governor signed senate bill no. 620 into law. senate bill no. 620 amended section 12022.53 to provide 1385 and at the time of sentencing, strike or dismiss an ( 12022.53, subd. (h); stats. 2017, ch. 632,  2.) an amendment to the penal code will not generally apply retroactively. (see  3.) however, an exception applies when the amendment reduces punishment for a specific crime. (see in re estrada (1965) 63 cal.2d 740, 745 (estrada); accord, people v. brown (2012) 54 cal.4th 314, 323-324.) reduction of a 5 linares also requested that we remand for resentencing based on senate bill no. 1393. on september 30, 2018, the governor signed senate bill no. 1393 into law. senate bill no. 1393 amended sections 667 and 1385 to delete statutory language prohibiting judges from striking enhancements imposed pursuant to section 667, subdivision (a) for prior serious felonies. ( 667, subd. (a);  1385, subd. (b); stats. 2018, ch. 1013,  1 & 2.) because we struck the applicable prior serious felony that we remand to allow the trial court to determine whether to strike those enhancements is moot. 18 that its former penalty was too severe and that a lighter punishment is proper as punishment for the commission of the estrada, supra, at p. 745.) that includes all cases in which the judgment is not yet final as of the id. at p. 744.) the exception to nonretroactivity extends to amendments the trial court discretion to impose a lesser sentence. (people v. francis (1969) 71 cal.2d 66, 75-76; see also people v. superior court (lara) (2018) 4 cal.5th 299, 308.) the people agree that senate bill no. 620 applies to linares. but the people argue that we need not remand the case because the trial court stated on the record that if it had discretion to strike the firearm enhancement in this case, it would not do so. (see people v. mcvey (2018) 24 cal.app.5th 405, 419 (mcvey).) regarding the firearm enhancement, the people requested that s point that even if the court firearm enhancement. the trial court responded that it intended to make that finding and ultimately did state on the record that it would not exercise its discretion to strike the firearm enhancement. case were remanded, the trial court would exercise its discretion to strike the enhancement . . . . we therefore conclude that remand in these circumstances would serve no purpose but to 19 mcvey, supra 24 cal.app.5th at p. 419.) e. errors in the abstracts of judgment the abstract of judgment for counts 1, 2, and 6 reflect two firearm enhancements each for counts 1 and 2, for a total of 40 years, one gang enhancement for each of counts 1 and 2, and two section 667, subdivision (a) enhancements each for counts 1 and 2. the abstract of judgment for counts 7, 8, and 9 reflects a section 667, subdivision (d) enhancement for count 9 that the section 667, subdivision (a) enhancement. linares contends that the abstracts of judgment do not correctly reflect sentence and asks us to correct them. the firearm enhancements, the gang enhancements, and the prior serious felony enhancements were all used to calculate the counts 1 and 2. additionally, the firearm enhancements and the prior serious felony enhancements were imposed as determinate sentences on each of the two counts. the people argue that the abstracts of judgment are correct (mostlywith the exception of the section 667, subdivision (d) enhancement that should be a section 667, subdivision (a) enhancement), but acknowledge that they could be clarified. we will order the clerk of the superior court to amend the abstracts of judgment in the following manner: delete each of the enhancements attributed to any subdivision of section 667; delete two of the four listed firearm enhancements (one for each of counts 1 and 2) ( 12022.53, subd. (c)); 20 delete the gang enhancements, which were used to sentences on counts 1 and 2, but were not separately imposed ( 186.22, subd. (b)); revise the entries on lines six and eight on the abstract of judgment for counts 1, 2, and 6 to reflect the correct terms 9 and 35 years to life plus 20 years on each of counts 1 and 2, for a total of 95 years to life plus 40 years. disposition enhancements under section 667, subdivision (a) to calculate the ences and determinate sentences is reversed. on remand, the trial court is ordered to amend the abstract of judgment consistent with this respects. not to be published. chaney, j. we concur: rothschild, p. j. bendix, j.
