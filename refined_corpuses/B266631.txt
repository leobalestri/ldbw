(see people v. burnes (2015) 242 cal.app.4th 1452, 1457-1459.) however, the trial court considered it without objection. in addition, the parties argued the facts taken from the report, and on appeal both parties rely on the same facts. we thus assume that both sides at least tacitly agreed to consider the probation report. 4 stolen cards which,000. the prosecutor argued that defendant entered the store with all the stolen cards, and although he chose to make a smaller purchase, the potential loss to the store was more than $950. unconvinced that count 2 qualified for a proposition 47 reduction to a misdemeanor, the court continued the case to the following month for further hearing, and ordered a supplemental probation report. at the second hearing, no additional evidence was presented by either party. the trial court heard the argument of counsel, read and considered the case file, including the supplemental probation report. defense counsel represented that the value of the merchandise defendant had purchased with a stolen card was $154.45. the prosecution did not disagree with that amount, but argued that defendant entin possession of all nine cards relating to count 3, and that the cards had a total value of over $10,000, from which the court could infer that s intent when he entered the store was to steal more than $950 in merchandise. defense counsel objected to consideration of the facts underlying count 3, but the trial court agreed with the prosecution and found that the amount in issue as to count 2 exceeded $950, making it ineligible for reduction to a misdemeanor. the court denied the petition and reinstated probation on the same terms and conditions. defendant filed a timely notice of appeal from the order denying the petition. discussion i. theft by false pretenses and larceny proposition 47 added the new crime of shoplifting, commercial establishment with intent to commit larceny while that establishment is open during regular business hours, where the value of the property that is taken or intended to ( 459.5, subd. (a).) respondent contends that the order denying the petition as to count 2 must be affirmed pretenses, whereas shoplifting requires an intent to commit larceny. respondent reasons on 459.5 was not intended to include theft by false 5 pretenses, because larceny requires a trespassory taking, meaning obtained by fraud. respondent relies on the only published case which supports this theory; however, as the california supreme court has since granted a petition for hearing people v. gonzales (2015) 242 cal.app.4th 35, review granted february. 17, 2016, s231171.) gonzales relied on people v. williams (2013) 57 cal.4th 776 (williams), in robbery, after reviewing the historical definitions of theft crimes, including common law larceny and theft by false pretenses. (see williams, supra, at pp. 781-785.)4 although we find in williams helpful in demonstrating that respons contention is without merit, we find williams to be distinguishable as it involved a conviction for robbery. as respondent argues, a taking without the property s consent (williams, supra, 57 cal.4th at p. 788.) however, consent may be vitiated by fraud; for example, at common law, larceny by trick was deemed to be a trespassory taking, procured by fraud. (id. at pp. 783-784.) in 1927, the california legislature enacted section 484, subdivision (a), which consolidated larceny, false pretenses, and embezzlement (williams, supra, at p. 785; stats. 1927, ch. 619,  1.)5 now, larceny by trick and theft 4 two other recently published cases have distinguished williams and rejected the reasoning of gonzales. petitions for review in the supreme court have been granted in both cases. (see people v. triplett (2016) 244 cal.app.4th 824, 833-834, review granted april 27, 2016, s233172; people v. vargas (2016) 243 cal.app.4th 1416, 1420-1421, review granted mar. 30, 2016, s232673.) 5 feloniously steal, take, [or] carry . . . away the personal property of another, . . . or who shall knowingly and designedly, by any false or fraudulent representation or pretense, defraud any other person of money . . . or personal property 6 ce is that larceny by trick is committed by the fraudulent acquisition of only the possession of property, whereas theft by false pretenses results in the fraudulent acquisition of both possession and title. (people v. ashley (1954) 42 cal.2d 246, 258-259; see williams, supra, at p. 784.) in 1927 the legislature also enacted section 490a. (people v. nguyen (1995) 40 cal.app.4th 28, 31; stats. 1927, ch. 619,  7.) the california statute provides herever any law or statute of this state refers to or mentions larceny, embezzlement, ( 490a.) this means that a statute sunow be read people v. dingle (1985) 174 cal.app.3d 21, 30; see also people v. parson (2008) 44 cal.4th 332, 354he legislature has indicated a clear intent tlarceny as used in the burglary statute should be read to include all thefts, theft by false pretenses (people v. nguyen, supra, at pp. 30-31.)6 is deemed to be aware of existing laws and judicial constructions in effect at the time legislation is enacted. people v. weidert (1985) 39 cal.3d 836, 844.) it is not to be presumed that the [enacting body] intends to overthrow long-established principles of law unless such intention is made clearly to appear either by express declaration or by necessary implication. [citations.]county of los angeles v. frisbie (1942) 19 cal.2d 634, 644.) further, as the language of a 6 at oral argument, respondent cited people v. darling (1964) 230 cal.app.2d 615, to support the argument that larceny does not include theft by false pretenses for purposes of section 459.5. in darling the appellate court held that welfare fraud amounted to theft by false pretenses rather than embezzlement; and that section 490a should not be construed to eliminate the punishment and limitations exceptions to embezzlement of public funds under sections 799 and 800. (darling, at pp. 617-620.) as the facts in darling were exceptional, it has limited application. the darling court did not consider whether theft by false pretenses was larceny for purposes of the burglary statute, as did the court in people v. nguyen, supra, 40 cal.app.4th at page 31, which provides the better analogy for purposes of applying section 459.5. 7 statute is construed in the context of the overall statutory scheme in which it is found, a word that appears in different places within a statutory scheme is generally presumed to have the same meaning each time it is used. (people v. gray (2014) 58 cal.4th 901, 906.) there is nothing in the language of section 459.5 or the ballot materials cited by respondent to indicate that the electorate intended to return to the common law meaning of larceny as not including theft by false pretenses. indeed during the pendency of this matter the fourth appellate district published people v. root (2016) 245 cal.app.4th 353 (petn. for review pending, petn. filed apr. 6, 2016) false pretenses is precisely the type of nonserious, nonviolent crime proposition 47 was aimed toward affecting. . . . [t]heft by false pretenses is less likely to involve violence than a situation where a person has the intention to steal openly displayed merchandise from a store. to provide misdemeanors for that type of theft, but not for theft by false pretenses, would contradicid. at p. 360.) we thus conclude that in section 459.5, as in section 459, an intent to commit larceny means an intent to commit theft, which includes theft by false pretenses. ii. harvey7 objection (1) entry into a commercial establishment, (2) while the establishment is open during regular business hours, and (3) with intent to commit larceny of property value(in re j.l. (2015) 242 cal.app.4th 1108, 1114.) was not a commercial establishment or that it was not open during regular business hours when defendant purchased merchandise with a stolen gift card. only the third element was in dispute. a defendant who seeks to have a second degree burglary conviction reduced to misdemeanor shoplifting bears the initial burden to show that the value of the items taken was less than $950. (people v. rivas-colon (2015) 241 cal.app.4th 444, 449-450; 7 people v. harvey (1979) 25 cal.3d 754 (harvey). 8 people v. sherow (2015) 239 cal.app.4th 875, 879-880.) although respondent agrees that the amount taken was less than $950, respondent argues that the value of the property defendant intended to take was the deciding factor, and that evidence of the nine payment cards at another time and location proved that intent. charge in count 3, theft of access card account information, in violation of section 484e, subdivision (d), and that count 3 had been dismissed pursuant to a plea agreement. defendant contends that reliance on facts underlying the dismissed count was improper under the principles expressed in harvey. in harvey, the california supreme court held that where an unrelated count is dismissed in consideration of guilty to another count or counts, it would be improper and unfair to permit the sentencing court to consider any of the facts underlying the dismissed count . . . for purposes of aggs sentence. . . . implicit in such a plea bargain . . . is the understanding (in the absence of any contrary agreement) that defendant will suffer no adverse sentencing consequences by reason of the facts underlying, and solely pertaining to, the dismissed count.(harvey, supra, 25 cal.3d at p. 758.) harvey waive(people v. weatherton (2015) 238 cal.app.4th 676, 678.) prior to the trial court ruling, defense counsel asked the court to look at the allegations of count 3, and pointed out the absence of a harvey plea. our review of defe written plea agreement supports argument to the trial court that the guilty plea in 2014 did not include a harvey waiver. courts have extended the harvey rule beyond sentencing to prohibit consideration of dismissed counts when fixing the conditions of probation (people v. beagle (2004) 125 cal.app.4th 415, 417-418, 421); and under circumstances more analogous to a proposition 47 case, when deciding whether to recall a third strike sentence under proposition 36. (people v. berry (2015) 235 cal.app.4th 1417, 1425; see  1170.126.) one court more recently upheld a underlying a dismissed count to deny a proposition 47 petition, because there had, in fact, 9 been a harvey waiver in that case. (see people v. hoffman (2015) 241 cal.app.4th 1304, 1310-1311.) the underlying facts of a dismissed count are considered unrelated and subject to the harvey prohibition, unless they are ransactionally relatedto the relevant count. (harvey, supra, 25 cal.3d at p. 758.) the facts of one count are transactionally related to those of another when the charged offenses arose out of the same incident or were part of the same transaction; for example, one count alleging an offense committed with the use of a firearm, and the other count alleging illegal possession of the same firearm. (people v. beagle, supra, 125 cal.app.4th at p. 421.) a tenuous connection will not justify reliance on the underlying facts of a dismissed count; there must from which it could at least be inferred that some action of the defendant giving rise to the dismissed count was also involved in the admitted count.id. at p. 421; see, e.g., people v. bradford (1995) 38 cal.app.4th 1733, 1739 [firearms found on property devoted entirely to illegal drug operation].) on the other hand, a coincidentally simultaneous possession of multiple items does not make the possession of each item transactionally related. (see, e.g., people v. berry, supra, 235 cal.app.4th at pp. 1421-1422, 1426 [possession of firearm, fraus license]; people v. beagle, supra, at pp. 417-418, 421-422 [possession of nunchakus and drugs in different parts of house]; people v. berry (1981) 117 cal.app.3d 184, 197 [possession of gun in vehicle, absent showing that defendant used the gun to obtain or retain possession of the vehicle].) harvey objection was inadequate or not understood by the trial court. indeed, respondent disregards harvey contention altogether, and makes the same argument that the prosecutor made below: that although the value of the property taken was less than $950, the facts of the dismissed count strongly suggested that at the time defendant entered the store, he intended to steal more than $950 in merchandise; thus his crime was burglary, not shoplifting. relied on such facts. 10 the facts underlying count 3 appeared in the probation report, which reported that the nine stolen cards were found in defendanton the same day as the incident at in addition, the prosecutor represented to the court that according to the police report, some of the cards were debit cards with limits of more than $5,000. although the possession of stolen payment cards in one location presents facts similar to the possession of stolen gift cards by the same person at another location, the question becomes whether the record shows a sufficient connection to both incidents, such that the two incidents were transactionally related. (see beagle, supra, 125 cal.app.4th at pp. 421-422.) the cards with limits over $5,000 were debit cards, whereas the cards used in marsha while it can reasonably be inferred that defendant intended to use some or all of the stolen debit cards somewhere and at some time, we have found no support in the record for rwhen defendant entered marshhe possessed or intended to use . a the traffic stop. however, the record is silent as to whether defendant obtained possession of the nine cards or even how much time elapsed between the traffic stop and when defendant ma. as the stolen debit cards recovered from the traffic stop were not shown to have been in when he , they were not shown to be involved thus the fact of possession in count 3 was not transactionally related to count 2, and we conclude that the trial court improperly relied on the facts underlying count 3. regardless, we agree with defendant that, assuming that the trial court properly considered the facts of count 3 to find that two of the nine cards had been issued with $5,000 limits, and to infer that defendant was in possession of all nine cards when he entered marshalls, it remains speculative whether defendant intended to buy more than he did buy, particularly without some evidence that he attempted to or was prevented from so doing. moreover, count 3 was based possession of the nine 11 cards, not their value, and there was no suggestion that any of the cards, even those with a $5,000 limit, had a sufficient balance or combined balance to permit defendant to purchase more than $950 worth of merchandise. given such circumstances, the evidence offense was less than $950. iii. remand respondent contends that in the event of reversal, we should remand to allow the trial court to make a determination pursuant to section 1170.18, subdivision (b), which provides that where an offense qualifies for reduction to a misdemeanor, the trial court m, resentencing the petitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety is defined in section 1170.18, subdivision (c), as an unreasonable risk that the defendant will commit one of the violent felonies specified in section 667, subdivision (e)(2)(c)(iv). upon reversal of the denial of a proposition 47 petition, the matter should be remanded to the trial court to exercise its discretion to make the public safety determination, if it has not already done so. (cf. t.w. v. superior court (2015) 236 cal.app.4th 646, 649 (t.w.).) here, at the first hearing on the proposition 47 petition, the trial court found defendant eligible to have count 1 reduced to a misdemeanor, and in the second hearing, the from this record, it appears that the trial court did exercise its discretion to assess the risk of danger to public safety posed by defendant, and found no unreasonable risk. remand is thus unnecessary. respondent also contends that reversal requires remand to give the prosecution the opportunity to seek withdrawal from the plea agreement and reinstatement of the original three charges. respondent rests this entire argument on harris v. superior court (2015) 12 242 cal.app.4th 244, review granted february 24, 2016, s231489. as the california supreme court has granted a petition for review in that case, we do not consider it.8 in accordance with the plea agreement in this case, defendant admitted two felonies and the third was dismissed. the trial court later granted in part proposition 47 petition, and reduced count 1, a felony, to a misdemeanor. respondent probation, would fundamentally alter the character of the plea bargain. remand to give the people the opportunity to apply to vacate the plea agreement would be a futile and wasteful exercise, as the trial court would be compelled to deny such a motion on either of two grounds. first, w-for benefit was altered when the trial court reduced count 1 to a misdemeanor. at that time, the prosecutor did not oppose granting the petition as to count 1, nor was there a motion to vacate the plea agreement, or take an appeal from the order. as tcount 1 is final, it is too late to reinstate the original three charges. respondent has cited no authority which would permit the people to withdraw from part of a plea bargain, which, in any event, would result in a modification of the agreement, not in vacating it. once a plea agreement has been accepted by the parties and the court, it may not be modified without the consent of both parties. (people v. martin (2010) 51 cal.4th 75, 80.) the general rule in california is that the plea agreement will be of the state to amend the law or enact additional laws for the public good and in pursuance of public policy. . . . (doe v. harris (2013) 57 cal.4th 64, 65.) 8 petitions for review have also been granted in three recently published appellate court opinions which have expressly disagreed with harris. (see people v. perry (2016) 244 cal.app.4th 1251, 1259, review granted april 27, 2016, s233287; people v. brown (2016) 244 cal.app.4th 1170, 1179, review granted april 27, 2016, s233274; people v. gonzalez (2016) 244 cal.app.4th 1058, 1072-1073, review granted april 27, 2016, s233219.) 13 are deemed to know and understand that the state, . . . subject to the limitations imposed by the federal and state constitutions, may enact laws that will affect the consequences attending the conviction entered upon the plea.id. at p. 70.) at the time of the plea, the parties may affirmatively agree, such as by including a harvey waiver, that the consequences of the plea will remain fixed despite changes to the relevant law. (doe, supra, at pp. 70-71; see harvey supra, 25 cal.3d 758.) we find no evidence in this record to suggest that the parties understood or agreed that the plea agreement would not be affected by changes in the law that benefitted one of the parties. second, section 1170.18, subdivision (a), which expressly provides for the reduction of certain felonies to misdemeanors whether the defendant was convicted by trial or plea, applies to convictions resulting from plea agreements. (t.w., supra, 236 cal.app.4th at pp. 652-653.) in t.w.petition on the ground that there had been a negotiated plea bargain where one felony count had been dismissed in exchange for the mcount. (id. at pp. 649-651.) the appellate court reversed, holding that the trial court erred by engrafting a plea agreement disqualifier into the statute. (id. at pp. 651-652.) there is no automatic disqualifier in the language of section 1170.18, but only the discretionary finding that the defendant pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety; and the language of the statute does not suggest any other discretionary disqualifier or any intent to exclude convictions obtained by plea agreement. (id. at p. 652;  1170.18, subd. (c).) to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the voters, the t.w. court looked to proposition 47 ballot materials, noting that the proponents of the initiative argued that the measure would stop wasting prison space, and would focus the resources of law enforcement less on the offenses subject to reduction to misdemeanors, and more on violent and serious crimes. (t.w., supra, at p. 652, citing voter information guide, argument in favor of prop. 47, at p. 38.) reading a plea agreement disqualifier into the statute would defeat, rather than further that intent. (t.w., at pp. 652-653.) it follows that vacating a plea agreement after a proposition 47 petition is granted in whole or part, or after reversal of an order denying the petition, would have the same 14 effect as denying the petition in the first instance in order to preserve the plea bargain. such a procedure would be no less a hindrance to effectuating the intent of the voters. , other than to direct the trial court to disposition the order of the superior court entered june 23, 2015, denying the petition to reduce count 2 to a misdemeanor, is reversed. the order granting the petition as to count 1 is affirmed. the superior court is directed to enter an order conviction of count 2 to a misdemeanor. not to be published in the official reports. ____________________________, j. chavez we concur: __________________________, p. j. boren __________________________, j. ashmann-gerst
