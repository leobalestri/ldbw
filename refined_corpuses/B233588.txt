(b)) and failing to update registration annually ( 290.012, subd. (a).)1 in may 2010, shortly after his arrest, appellant had been given permission to represent himself in accordance with faretta v. california (1975) 422 u.s. 806 (faretta). during his period of self-representation, he demurred and filed a motion to set aside the information under section 995, a motion to dismiss, two writ petitions, and a motion to disqualify a judge. on october 22, 2010, after denying ify, the court found appellant had been disruptive in the courtroom and deceptive with respect to a ruling received from the court of appeal on one of his writ petitions, revoked his pro se status, and appointed an attorney to represent him. as soon as his appointed counsel appeared, appellant requested a marsden hearing, contending they had a conflict.2 the court denied the request. in october 27, 2010, appellant pled nolo contendere to one count of failure to register under section 290, subdivision (b), and was sentenced to three years. he was given credit for time served and placed on probation. during the hearing on the plea and sentence, he made no reference to self-representation or conflicts with his appointed attorney. 1 appellant had been convicted of first degree rape in 1981 in washington state. undesignated statutory references are to the penal code. 2 people v. marsden (1970) 2 cal.3d 118. 3 b. motion to vacate foprobation requirement of registering within five days. in january 2011, appellant appeared in court and provided proof of registration. his probation was revoked and reinstated. on april 27, 2011, appellant filed a motion to vacate his plea, contending, among other things, that he had been very ill in september 2010 due to research and review the document; that the revocation of his pro se status and use of imminent danger complaining witness, endorsed by any magistrate and filed with the court, as rrule on a disqualification motion directed at himself. the court set a hearing on the motion for may 27, 2011. on may 24, 2011, appellant filed a motion to continue the hearing on the motion to vacate, contending he needed transcripts of all the prior hearings to 3 3 appellant also filed a motion for change of venue and a motion to disqualify the presiding judge. 4 on may 27, 2011, the court denied the motion for continuance and heard and denied the motion to vacate. appellant filed a notice of appeal and request for a certificate of probable cause, seeking to challenge the validity of his plea and the denial of his motion to vacate. he contended, among other things, that the court lacked jurisdiction over him. the court denied the request for a certificate of probable cause. c. motion to dismiss appeal after appellant filed his opening brief, respondent moved to dismiss on the grounds that (1) appellant had raised matters pertaining to alleged violation of his faretta and marsden rights that should have been raised in an appeal from the final judgment of conviction;4 and (2) appellant had failed to obtain the certificate of probable cause required by section 1237.5 following a guilty or nolo contendere plea.5 appellant opposed, contending that as the appeal had been taken from the denial of a motion to vacate, it required no certificate of probable cause; that the court had erred in refusing his request for a continuance to obtain transcripts of vacate; and that he had raised or intended to raise issues pertaining to a 4 . . shall be deemed to be a final judgment . . . 5 shall be taken by the defendant from a judgment of conviction upon a plea of guilty or nolo contendere . . . except where . . .

(people v. totari, supra, 28 cal.4th at p. 882; gallardo, supra, 77 cal.app.4th at p. 981; people v. thomas, supra, 52 cal.2d at p. 528; 6 witkin & epstein, cal. criminal law (4th ed. 2012) criminal appeal,  66-67, pp. 342-343.) the denial of a motion to vacate in these situations is appealable, creating a conundrum for the appellate court because its determination of appealability requires it to delve into the merits of the appeal. (see ibid.; people v. thomas, supra, at p. court determines the issue witkin & epstein, supra, criminal appeal,  69, p. 344; accord, people v. thomas, supra, ented by motion to as to the appealability of the order will ordinarily depend upon its decision of the merits of the appeal, i.e., upon its determination whether there was indeed a consideration of the issues that the underlying motion raised no fundamental jurisdictional defect, that the judgment is not void on its face, and that the errors, if people v. cantrell (1961) 197 cal.app.2d 40, 44-45.) here, the alleged improper revocation of appeformed the basis of an appeal after the court entered judgment in october 2010. 7 (see, e.g., people v. marlow (2004) 34 cal.4th 131, 146-147 [contention on appeal that trial court erred in denying faretta motion not forfeitguilty on advice of subsequently appointed counsel]; people v. robinson (1997) 56 faretta violation may . . . properly be raised ant did not file a timely appeal of the judgment of conviction. he contends, however, that the appeal of the denial of his motion to vacate falls within the exceptions to the requirement of direct appeal because the alleged faretta error created a fundamental or structural jurisdictional defect rendering the judgment void, and because records needed to prove his case would not have been available on appeal.7 we address these contentions in turn. ors are of two absence of power to hear or determine the case, an absence of authority over the of power) to act except in a particular manner, or to give certain kinds of relief, or to [citation. 7 motion to dismiss the appeal. following denial of the motion to dismiss, appellant essentially abandoned his claim of marsden error by failing to raise any argument that the alleged marsden error led to the type of jurisdictional defect that rendered the judgment void, or that the records necessary to establish the alleged marsden error would not have been available on appeal. 8 act or judgment is valid until it is set aside, and a party may be precluded from setting it people v. ramirez (2008) 159 cal.app.4th 1412, 1422, italics omitted, quoting people v. american contractors indemnity co.

(people v. ramirez, supra, 159 cal.app.4th at p. 1417.) two years later, following a subsequent violation, the court terminated his probation and ordered him to serve the longer sentence, at which time he appealed, contending the court lacked the authority to increase his sentence in 2004. (ibid.) the court of appeal agreed that the trial relief.
