(cal. rules of court, rule 8.308(a); in re chavez (2003) 30 cal.4th 643, 650.) second, even had his notice of appeal been timely, before challenging the validity of a no contest plea, a defendant must obtain from the trial court a certificate of probable cause. (pen. code,  1237.5; people v. shelton (2006) 37 cal.4th 759, 766; people v. mendez (1999) 19 cal.4th 1084, 1099; cal. rules of court, rule 8.304(b).) in the absence of a certificate of probable cause, we may not consider the validity of the plea and whether defendant was deprived of effective assistance of counsel. (people v. panizzon (1996) 13 cal.4th 68, 76; people v. stubbs (1998) 61 cal.app.4th 243, 244245; people v. puente (2008) 165 cal.app.4th 1143, 1152.) as to the proceedings conducted on october 2, 2017, in which the trial court found bryant in violation of probation and reinstated probation, we have examined the record and are satisfied appointed counsel has fully complied with her responsibilities and no arguable issues exist.
