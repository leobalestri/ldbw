(people v. yearwood (2013) 213 cal.app.4th 161, 180181.) we agree appellant is entitled to an independent review by this court. we have conducted such a review and agree with the trial court that there is no discoverable material in the personnel files. 3 ii. we decline to address fines, fees, and assessments relying on people v. dueas, appellant contends the trial court should not have imposed fees, fines, and assessments without conducting an ability-to-pay hearing. appellant failed to raise this issue in the trial court. california law provides that an attempt to correct errors in the imposition of fines and fees must be made first to the sentencing court before it can be raised on appeal. (pen. code,  1237.2; people v. aguilar (2015) 60 cal.4th 862, 864 [failure to raise challenge to fees in the trial court precludes consideration of issue on appeal].) appellant has not raised the issue in the trial court; we therefore decline to consider the issue. disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports stratton, j. we concur: bigelow, p. j. grimes, j.
