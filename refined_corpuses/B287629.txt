(a)) and alleging that hernandez personally used a firearm in the commission of the crime ( 12022.53, subd. (b)). the information also alleged that hernandez had suffered a prior conviction of making a criminal threat ( 422), constituting a strike under the three strikes law ( 667, subds. (b)-(j), 1170.12) 1 all undesignated section references are to the penal code. 3 and a serious felony ( 667, subd. (a)), and had suffered four prior convictions, served prison terms for those offenses, and did not remain free from prison custody for a period of five years after the conclusion of each term ( 667.5, subd. (b)). 3. the verdict and sentencing a jury convicted hernandez of carjacking and found that the firearm use allegation was true. hernandez admitted the prior strike under the three strikes law and four prior prison terms under section 667.5, subdivision (b). the trial court sentenced hernandez on december 11, romero motion to strike his prior strike (people v. romero (1996) 13 cal.4th 497). the court sentenced hernandez to a total of 33 years in prison, consisting of the high term of nine years for carjacking, doubled to 18 years under the three strikes law, plus 10 years for the firearm enhancement ( 12022.53, subd. (b)) and five years for the prior serious felony ( 667, subd. (a)(1)). the court struck the four prior prison term enhancements in the furtherance of justice, pursuant to section 1385. discussion at the time of sentencing in december 2017, the trial court had no authority to strike a firearm enhancement under section 12022.53. former section section 12022.53, subdivision (h) expressly precluded striking such an enhancement. (stats. 2010, ch. 711,  5). as amended by senate bill 620 (2017-2018 reg. sess.), effective january 1, 2018,2 2 statutes enacted at a regular session go into effect on january 1 of the following year. (cal. const., art. iv,  8, subd. (c)(1).) 4 section 12022.53, subdivision (h) now gives the sentencing court the discretion to strike a firearm enhancement in furtherance of justice pursuant to section 1385.3 in re estrada (1965) 63 cal.2d 740 held that, absent evidence to the contrary, the court must presume the legislature intended any statutory amendment mitigating punishment for a particular crime to apply retroactively to all defendants whose judgments were not yet final on the operative date of the amendment.4 (id. at pp. 747748; see brown, supra, 54 cal.4th at p. 324 [estrada a legislative act mitigating the punishment for a particular the estrada rule applies not only to amendments reducing the penalty for a crime, but also to amendments giving the court discretion to impose a lesser penalty. (people v. francis (1969) 71 cal.2d 66, 76.) the estrada rule applies here because section 12022.53, subdivision (h), as amended, gives the trial court the discretion to impose a lesser sentence by striking a firearm enhancement, and the amendment became effective before this case became final on appeal. there is no indication the legislature intended the 3 as amended, section the court may, in the interest of justice pursuant to section 1385 and at the time of sentencing, strike or dismiss an enhancement otherwise required to be imposed by this section. the authority provided by this subdivision applies to any resentencing that may occur pursuant to any other law. 4 the estrada rule is an exception to the general rule that penal statutes are presumed to operate prospectively only unless expressly stated otherwise. ( 3; see people v. brown (2012) 54 cal.4th 314, 324 (brown).) 5 amendments to apply prospectively only. (people v. chavez (2018) 22 cal.app.5th 663, 712; people v. woods (2018) 19 cal.app.5th 1080, 10901091.) the people concede that the estrada rule applies and the amendment applies retroactively. isions made in [citation.] a court which is unaware of the scope of its sed appropriate remedy is to remand for resentencing unless the reached discretion. [citations.]people v. gutierrez (2014) 58 cal.4th 1354, 1391; see people v. mcdaniels (2018) 22 cal.app.5th 420, at the sentencing court clearly indicated that it would not in any event the people contend the record clearly indicates that the trial court would not have stricken the firearm enhancement if it had the discretion to do so at the time of sentencing. we agree. in denying romero motion, the trial court noted that hernandez had suffered numerous prior convictions since 2003, including most recently several felonies (criminal threat, domestic violence, false imprisonment, and transportation of a controlled substance) and misdemeanors (exhibiting a deadly weapon, two domestic violence convictions, two driving under the influence convictions, and vandalism). the court noted that hernandez had committed the current carjacking shortly after 6 being released on parole from his prior imprisonment for making a criminal threat, and stated that in light of his current and prior that the defendant is outside the letter and the spirit of the three and sentenced him to the high term of nine years, doubled to 18 years under the three strikes law as a result of the denial of the romero motion. indicate an intention to impose a lengthy sentence. there is no reason to believe that having selected the high term of nine years and having denied the romero motion, resulting in an additional after doubling under the three strikes law, the court would have stricken the 10-year firearm enhancement if it had the discretion to do so. although the court struck the four one-year prior prison term enhancements under section 667.5, subdivision (b), the record makes it clear that the court would not have exercised its discretion to strike the firearm enhancement and that remand would be an idle act. 7 disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports micon, j.* we concur: willhite, acting p. j. collins, j. *judge of the los angeles county superior court assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
