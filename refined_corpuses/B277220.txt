( 1170.126 subd. (e)(2), 667, subd. (e)(2)(c)(iii).) we affirm. factual and procedural background on july 25, 1994, los angeles county sheriff deputy mark renfrow entered an apartment to investigate a report of a man with a gun. after noticing a partially opened closet door in a bedroom, deputy renfrow opened the door farther and saw a comforter covering an apparent pile of clothes. deputy renfrow pulled back the comforter, and defendant, who had been lying under the comforter, pointed a semiautomatic pistol at deputy renf head and chest. deputy renfrow started to squeeze the trigger of his gun, and defendant dropped the pistol. after being advised of his rights under miranda v. arizona (1966) 384 u.s. 436, defendant told sherif deputies that he was hiding because he was on parole and knew he should not have a gun.2 1 all further statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise stated. 2 the factual background and part of the procedural background are people v. williams (jul. 20, 1998, b112451) (nonpub. opn.) (williams i). we take judicial notice of this opinion. (evid. code,  452, subd. (d)(1), 459, subd.(a).) 3 on march 16, 1995, a jury convicted defendant of possession of a firearm by a felon. (former  12021, subd. (a)(1).)3 the jury also found that defendant had two prior serious felony convictions within the meaning of the three strikes law ( 667, subds. (b)-(i)) and that he served three prior prison terms ( 667.5, subd. (b)). the trial court sentenced defendant to a prison term of 25 years to life. we affirmed the judgment of conviction in williams i. on february 8, 2013, defendant filed his petition for recall and resentencing. on august 25, 2016, the trial court denied the petition. that same date, defendant app discussion section 1170.126 was enacted as part of proposition 36, which became effective november 7, 2012. (people v. johnson (2015) 61 cal.4th 674, 685.) serving third strike sentences may seek resentencing in accordance with the . . . [] . . . [t]he inmate is serving an indeterminate term of life imprisonment imposed pursuant to [the three strikes law] for a conviction of a felony or (e)(1).) like a defendant who is being sentenced under the new provisions, an inmate is disqualified from resentencing if any of the exceptions set forth in section 667, subdivision (e)(2)(c) and section 1170.12, subdivision (c)(2)(c) 3 former section 12021, subdivision (a)(1) was repealed effective january 1, 2012, but its provisions were reenacted without substantive change as section 29800, subdivision (a)(1). (see people v. sanders (2002) 55 cal.4th 731, 743, fn. 12.) for convenience and brevity, we refer to former section 12021 throughout this opinion as section 12021. 4 johnson, at p. 682.) the referenced offenses for which resentencing is not available include those in which ssion of the current offense, the defendant used a firearm, was armed with a firearm or deadly weapon, or intended to cause great (c)(2)(c)(iii) (hereinafter referred collectively as subdivision (iii)).) the trial court here found defendant statutorily ineligible for recall and resentencing because defendant was armed with a firearm during commission of the underlying offense of being a felon in possession of a firearm. defsubdivision (iii) [must] attach to the current offense as an addition to, and render an inmate ineligible for resentencing are referred to with the phrase defendant contends that if the statute were intended to exclude the offense of possession of a firearm by a felon, the offense would have been specifically enumerated. separate, people v. pitto (2008) 43 cal.4th 228, 239-240; people v. bland (1995) 10 cal.4th 991,1001-1003; people v. weidert (1985) 39 cal.3d 836, 845-846.) thus, with respect to the crime of possession of is the 5 ve rejected his arguments,4 but contends such cases were wrongly decided. we disagree. first, defendant incorrectly asserts that being armed with a firearm is an element of the offense of being a felon in possession of a firearm. section 12021, subdivimakes it a felony for a person previously convicted of a felony to own, purchase, receive, or have in his or her possession or under osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th judicially construed to mean having a firearm available for use, either ibid.possessing a firearm does not id. at p. 1030.) for example, a felon is in possession of a firearm if the firearm is found at his residence, but if he is not home at the time, he is not armed because the firearm is not readily available to him. (ibid.) here, the record shows defendant was observed lying under a comforter with a semiautomatic pistol in hand, making it available for offensive or defensive use. thus, defendant ineligible for resentencing. 4 see people v. osuna (2014) 225 cal.app.4th 1020, 1030 (osuna) (when pulled over by police, defendant, who was holding a handgun when he got out of the car, was found to be armed with a firearm and ineligible for resentencing); people v. brimmer (2014) 230 cal.app.4th 782, 796-797 (defendant, who was holding a shotgun while arguing with his girlfriend, was found to be armed with a firearm and ineligible for resentencing); people v. elder (2014) 227 cal.app.4th 1308, 1317 (after polibedroom and found a gun on a shelf and another gun in a safe, defendant was found to be armed with a firearm and not eligible for resentencing); people v. white (2014) 223 cal.app.4th 512, 524-526 (when approached by police, defendant tossed a handgun and was held to be armed with a firearm and not eligible for resentencing). 6 second, the history not only narrowly drawn categories of third strike offenders who committed particular, specified offenses or types of offenses, but also broadly inclusive categories of offenders who, during commission of their crimesand used a firearm, were armed with a firearm or deadly weapon, or intended to cause great bodily injury to another person. significantly, however, those categories, while broad, are not unlimited. voters easily could have expressly disqualified any defendant who committed a gun-related felony or who possessed a firearm, had they wanted to do so. this is not what votpeople v. blakely (2014) 225 cal.app.4th 1042, 1055 (blakely).) the blakely court expressly distinguished between dangerous criminals who were deserving of life sentences, and petty criminals (such as shoplifters and those convicted of simple drug possession) who posed little or no risk to the public and did not id. at pp. 1056-convicted of two or more serious and/or violent felonies in the past, and most recently had a firearm readily available for use, simply does not pose little or ineligible for resentencing under proposition 36. (blakely, at p. 1057.) consistent with this analysis, courts have rejected the argument that separate offense. (see osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1032; see also people v. white (2016) 243 cal.app.4th 1354, 1362-1363; people v. hicks (2014) 231 cal.app.4th 275, 283-284; people v. brimmer, supra, 230 cal.app.4th at pp. 798-799; people v. elder, supra, 227 cal.app.4th at pp. 7 1312-1314; blakely, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at pp. 1051-1057; people v. white, supra, 223 cal.app.4th at pp. 524-527.) as explained in osuna, the phrase [h]aving a gun available does not further or aid in the commission of the (225 cal.app.4th at p.1032.) pitto and bland in support of his argument red is misplaced. neither pitto nor bland examined subdivision (iii). rather, both cases analyzed the sentence enhancement under section 12022, which imposed an additional prison term (pitto, supra, 43 cal.4th at pp. 239-240; bland, supra, 10 cal.4th at pp. 1001-1002.) as explained in blandoffense, section 12during facilitative nexus (bland, at p. 1002, original italics.) this holding has no relevance 12021 does not, regardless of the facts of the (osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1032.) thus, because defendant was the trial court properly determined that defendant was ineligible for recall and resentencing under proposition 36. 8 disposition the order denying the petition for recall and resentencing is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. goodman, j.* we concur: ashmann-gerst, acting p.j. chavez, j. * retired judge of the los angeles superior court assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
