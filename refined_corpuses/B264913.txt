test, defendant scored in the lowest categories for potential to cause serious or life-threatening physical harm and 8 for risk of committing an act of violence in the near future. the test also showed defendant required the lowest level of intervention to prevent future violence. minagawa opined that if defendant participated in a program that provided housing, vocational assistance, financial support, and substance abuse counseling, defendant would not pose an unreasonable risk to public safety. the amity foundation (amity) provided comprehensive reentry services to released inmates. it was prepared to help defendant transition into the community. in a written decision, the trial court denied the petition. the trial court stated that defendant had a lengthy history of committing multiple crimes when free from custody, even when on parole. defendant had 20 arrests, 15 convictions, and five parole violations. he had not been free from custody or parole supervision since 1982. the trial court rejected defendantcontention that his criminal history did not indicate he posed a risk to public safety because his convictions were remote and none involved serious violence, serious injuries to the victims, or the use of weapons. relying on people v. guzman (2015) 235 cal.app.4th 847, 860 review subsequently granted on june 17, 2015, s226410), the trial court ruled that the concept of public safety did not contemplate merely the absence of violent acts, it also included were for property crimes. moreover, three convictions were for transporting and/or selling drugs which compromised public 9 safety. the trial court described defendant as the classic drug addict who committed property crimes to support his habit. assessing dehe trial court stated, 2004 for possessing inmate manufactured alcohol and failing to provide a urine sample, and the 2010 rvr for possession for it observed that defendant had participated in alcohol and drug programs since his incarceration began, yet was caught with alcohol in his cell in april 2004, and admitted to minagawa that he drank alcohol at that time. five months after being caught, defendant failed to provide a urine sample even though he had three and one-conduct demonstrated to the trial court thaunable to abstain from alcohol despite consistent substance abuse he possessed the marijuana cigarette for barter, the trial court stated that such ly similar to his prior convictions for transporting and/or selling controlled substances. he thus exhibited behavior as recently as 2010 that reflects the same criminal mindset he possessed when he committed his crimes in the community. . . . [p]ossessinbodes poorly for his ability to refrain from selling or using drugs again if released i the trial court questioned motivation and sincerity in resuming of substance abuse programming in 2013. it noted defendant had been precluded from participating in a significant amount of programming while housed at calipatria 10 state prison, but ostensibly had more programming available to him following his transfer to salinas valley state prison in 2010. yet defendant did not resume substance abuse programming until 2013eight months after proposition 36 passed, and seven months after defendant filed his petition for resentencing in this case. all that was before it was the letter from amity. in the letter, amity potential release. amity to amity immediately upon release and then transport to the probation dservices if ordered by the trial court and worked closely with cdcr and an amity subcontractor for housing and employment services. deshe had confirmed amity had drug counseling. the trial court observed, however, there was no guarantee defendant would receive housing and employment services or drug counseling. the trial court discoudid not pose an unreasonable risk to public safety because subia did not consider reentry plans as a factor in his opinion. it he will still need support in terms of getting a job, transitional of reoffending in the community was increased without a solid and reliable reentry plan that was guaranteed upon his release. the trial court ruled, [t]he preponderance of the evidence demonstrates that [defendant] does pose an unreasonable risk of 11 danger to public safety at this time due to his criminal history, record of serious rules violations, insufficient rehabilitative programming, and inadequate [reentry] discussion the trial court acted within its discretion in denying a. standard of review the parties agree we review a trial coproposition 36 petition for recall of sentence under the abuse of discretion standard of review. ( 1170.126, subd. (f).) court does not abuse its discretion unless its decision is so irrational or arbitrary that no reasonable person could agree with people v. carmony (2004) 33 cal.4th 367, 377.) b. application of relevant principles when a petitioner satisfies the eligibility criteria for resentencing under section 1170.126, subdivision (e), the petitioner shall be resentenced pursuant to paragraph (1) of subdivision (e) of section 667 and paragraph (1) of subdivision (c) of section 1170.12 unless the court, in its discretion, determines that resentencing the petitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.subd. (f).) in other words, after proposition 36, a qualified prisoner who is serving a third-strike sentence for a felony that is neither serious nor violent may have his or her sentence recalled and be sentenced as a second-strike offender unless the court determines that resentencing would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.
