(a))1, and (2) being a felon carrying a concealed firearm (former  12025, subds. (a)(2) & (b)(1)). the people alleged that defendant, in 1988, had sustained two convictions for robbery ( 211) and one conviction for assault ikes law ( 667, subds. (b)-(j) & 1170.12, subd. (a)-(d)). the people further alleged that defendant had served two prior prison terms ( 667.5, subd. (b)). in 1996, a jury convicted defendant of both crimes and found all of the prior conviction allegations to be true. the trial court imposed a sentence of 27 years to life, comprised of a third strike sentence of 25 years to life on the felon-in-possession count plus one additional year for each prior prison term. the court stayed the sentence on the concealed firearm count pursuant to section 654. were affirmed on appeal. 1 section 12021 was redesignated as section 29800, subdivision (a)(1) in 2012. unless otherwise indicated, all further statutory references are to the penal code. 3 ii. proposition 36 petition in 2012, defendant filed a petition pursuant to proposition 36 ( 1170.126) seeking to have his sentence reduced to six years. the trial court issued an order to show cause why defendant should not be resentenced. after entertaining further briefing from the the commission of the [felon-in-possession] offense, [defendant] was armed with a defendant filed a timely appeal. discussion law required a court to impose a minimum sentence of 25 years to life for a defendant convicted of a felonyno matter what the felonyfelonies (so-2)(a) (2011) & 667, subd. (e)(2)(a) (2011).) in 2012, the voters passed proposition 36. the proposition modifies the three strikes law so that the minimum 25-year-to-life sentence may only be imposed on a third or subsequent felony conviction if that con( 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(c) & 667, subd. (e)(2)(c).) the proposition also grants defendants previously sentenced on a non---year-to-life sentence under the three strikes law the right to petition for resentencing on exception: some non--strike, will still trigger a minimum 25-year-to-life sentence. ( 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(c), 667, subd. (e)(2)(c) & ion of the current offense., 667, subd. (e)(2)(c)(iii) & 1170.126, subd. (e)(2).) defendant argues that the trial court erred in finding him ineligible for 4 questions of statutory interpretation, we review his claims de novo. (people v. brimmer (2014) 230 cal.app.4th 782, 790 (brimmer). we conclude that the trial court cpeople v. osuna (2014) 225 cal.app.4th 1020, 1029 (osuna); brimmer, supra, 230 cal.app.4th at p. 795; people v. bland (1995) 10 cal.4th 991, 997;  1203.06, subd. (b)(3).) in assessing eligibility for resentencing under proposition 36, we may look to the record of conviction, which includes the facts recited in any prior appellate decisions. (osuna, at p. 1030; people v. hicks (2014) 231 cal.app.4th 275, 286 (hicks).) the facts we recited above are drawn from our prior appellate decision, and they unloaded semiautomatic handgun in his waistband and discarded it on the walkway. several appellate decisions have come to the same result on nearly identical facts. (e.g., brimmer, at p. 797; osuna, at pp. 1032, 1035; hicks, at p. 285; people v. white (2014) 223 cal.app.4th 512, 523, 527; people v. blakely (2014) 225 cal.app.4th 1042, 1052; people v. elder (2014) 227 cal.app.4th 1308, 1312-1314 (elder); cf. people v. berry (2015) 235 cal.app.4th 1417, 1426 [no finding of ineligibility if the defendant was armed during an offense that was dismissed].) defendant appears to make three arguments as to why this solid wall of precedent is either incorrect or distinguishable. eligibility for resentencing turn on the offense itself. ( 1170.126, subd. (e)(2) & 667, subds. (e)(2)(c)(i) & (ii).) he further notes that the crime of being a felon in possession is not one of the categorically excluded offenses. (ibid.) because a violation of the felon-in-always involves arming,finds a defendant ineligible for being armed during a felon-in-possession offense is effectively (and impermissibly) adding the crime of being a felon in possession to the list of categorically excluded offenses. (e.g., state dept. of public health v. superior court 5 (2015) 60 cal.4th 940, 956 firearm blakely, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1052; brimmer, supra, 230 cal.app.4th at p. 795.) that is because a defendant can constructively dominion and controlbrimmer, at p. 795)) without actually possessing it (osuna, supra second, defendant argues that hfelon in possession. this argument appears to draw an analogy to the case law interpreting the sentencing enhancemserves brimmer, supra, 230 cal.app.4th at pp. 794-795; hicks, suprafurther or aid in the commission of the crime of possession of a firearm by a fel(hicks, enhancement to a felon-in-possession crime unless there is some further crime to which the arming can be ibid.) but this analogy does not withstand scrutiny. that is because the plain text of d]uring the subd. (e)(2)(c)(iii) & 1170.126, subd. (e)(2))not, as with the sentencing enhancement, in [its] com). as the court in osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th 1029 explains, this difference in language is significant. because temporal nexus between the arming and the underlying felony, not a facilitative osuna, at p. 1032, italics added; 6 hicks, supra, 231 cal.app.4th at pp. 283-284; see elder, supra, 227 cal.app.4th at pp. 1312-render defendant ineligible for relief under proposition 36. lastly, defendant contfor relief under proposition 36; declaring him ineligible is therefore inconsistent with the firearm . . .when viewed in light of the fact that he was physically armed with the firearm during the commission of th[at] offense[]cannot be deemed a petty or minor brimmer, supra, 230 cal.app.4th at p. 799.) rtion to its accessibility. obviously, a firearm that is available for use as a weapon creates the very blakely, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1057, quoting people v. mendival (1992) 2 cal.app.4th 562, 573.) for these reasons, our construction of proposition 36 disposition we affirm the order denying relief under proposition 36. not to be published in the official reports. _______________________, j. hoffstadt we concur: ________________________, p.j. boren ________________________, j. chavez
