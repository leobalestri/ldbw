filed 2/8/18 p. v. newman ca2/2 not to be published in the official reports california rules of court, rule 8.1115(a), prohibits courts and parties from citing or relying on opinions not certified for publication or ordered published, except as specified by rule 8.1115(b). this opinion has not been certified for publication or ordered published for purposes of rule 8.1115. in the court of appeal of the state of california second appellate district division two the people, plaintiff and respondent, v. charles newman, defendant and appellant. b280638 (los angeles county super. ct. no. ba438557) appeal from a judgment of the superior court of los angeles county. bernie c. laforteza, judge. affirmed as modified. sally patrone brajevich, under appointment by the court of appeal, for defendant and appellant. xavier becerra, attorney general, gerald a. engler, chief assistant attorney general, lance e. winters, senior assistant attorney general, steven d. matthews, supervising deputy attorney general, and rama r. maline, deputy attorney general, for plaintiff and respondent. * * * * * * 2 a jury convicted charles newman (defendant) of the felonies of driving under the influence (dui) and driving with a blood-alcohol concentration of 0.08 percent or more (at least a ), along with the misdemeanor of driving on a suspended license. in this appeal, he argues that (1) the prosecutor wrongly withheld discovery, (2) the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress, (3) the trial court misinstructed , (4) insufficient evidence supports his conviction for dui, and (5) the trial court erred in not staying the sentences imposed for all but the dui countour arguments lack merit, so we affirm his convictions. his last argument has merit, so we modify his sentence. facts and procedural background i. facts on a monday afternoon in july 2015, a motorcycle police officer saw a car speeding down a hill. the speed limit was 45 mile per hour at the top of the hill, and 40 miles per hour at the bottom. the officer estimated the car was traveling at 61 miles per hour, and his laser gun clocked the car at 63 miles per hour. the officer immediately pulled the car over and did not observe a defendant was the driver. as the officer spoke with defendant, he smelled the odor of alcohol, saw defendant covering his mouth with his hand, and noticed that defendant was avoiding eye contact. when asked for suspended due to a prior dui. after being asked to get out of his car, the officer could see that defendant leaned against the car for support. defendant 3 ,pleaded with the officer not to take him to jail. the officer then administered a number of field sobriety ger-to--and-turn-leg standtest. defendant had a difficult time following the directions. ts indicated he was impaired. the officer arrested defendant, transported him to the police station, and administered two breath tests indicating that blood-alcohol content was 0.155 percent, which is nearly twice the legal limit of 0.08 percent. ii. procedural background in the operative second amended information, the people charged defendant with: (1) felony dui, with a prior dui conviction in the past 10 years (veh. code,  23152, subd. (a) & 23550.5); (2) felony driving with at least a 0.08 bac, with a prior dui conviction in the past 10 years (id.,  23152, subd. (b) & 23550.5); and (3) misdemeanor driving on a license suspended due to a prior dui conviction (id.,  14601.2, subd. (a)). the ion for driving with at least a 0.08 bac constituted a prior dui conviction and a prior prison term (pen. code,  667.5, subd. (b)). defendant waived his right to counsel and represented himself. after the trial court bifurcated the trial regarding , a jury found defendant guilty of all three offenses. the court then found the allegations regarding the prior conviction to be true. 4 the trial court sentenced defendant to state prison for four years and to county jail for an additional 180 days. the court imposed four years on the dui count, comprised of a three-year base term plus one year for the prior prison term. the court imposed a concurrent three-year term on the driving with at least a 0.08 bac count, and a consecutive 180-day jail sentence on the misdemeanor driving on a suspended license count. defendant filed this timely appeal. discussion i. discovery violations defendant argues that the prosecutor violated the criminal discovery act (act) (pen. code,  1054.1 et seq.), and in so doing, committed prosecutorial misconduct and violated constitutional rights to confrontation and due process. in particular, defendant asserts that the prosecutor did not timely disclose: (1) the video footage from a worn by the officer during the traffic stop; ((3) the department of motor vehicles (dmv) records reflecting documents re1 the trial court either expressly or implicitly concluded there was no underlying discovery violation under the act, and we review that 1 defendant invokes brady v. maryland (1963) 373 u.s. 83, but brady obligates the prosecutor to disclose evidence strickler v. greene (1999) 527 u.s. 263, 281-282). because all of the evidence the prosecutor allegedly failed to disclose was inculpatory, there can be no brady violation. (people v. verdugo (2010) 50 cal.4th 263, 281.) 5 finding for substantial evidence. (people v. riggs (2008) 44 cal.4th 248, 306.) a. video footage from helmet cam attorney [to] disclose [s]a part of the the secuting knowledge after that 30-day cutoff, id.,  1054.7.) a ording the defendant an opportunity to examine, inspect, or copy the schaffer v. superior court (2010) 185 cal.app.4th 1235, 1237-1238 (schaffer); rubio v. superior court (2016) 244 cal.app.4th 459, 478-479; people v. zaragoza (2016) 1 cal.5th 21, 51.) the prosecutor complied with the duty to disclose the video footage from the helmet cam. the prosecutor did not physically give a copy of the disc containing the video footage to the defense because he could not: defendant was in custody (where no discs were allowed) and had no counsel. so the prosecutor let the defendant knowmore than 10 weeks before trialthat the disc was available for his investigator to pick up and view. four weeks later, the prosecutor informed defendant that his investigator had yet to pick up the disc, and the defendant two weeks before trial, 6 the prosecutor again indicated that the video was available for inspection. defendant made no further effort to obtain the video prior to trial.2 and when defendant complained he had still not viewed the video on the first day of trial, the court stopped the trial to let defendant watch it on [ed] the defendant an opportunity to examine, inspect(schaffer, supra, 185 cal.app.4th at pp. 1237-1238, 1244-1245); failure to avail himself of that opportunity does not equate to nondisclosure. b. call as terms, this provision effectively requires the prosecutor to disclose his or her witness list. (izazaga v. superior court (1991) 54 cal.3d 356, 375.) the prosecutor complied with this duty. at trial, the prosecutor called four witnessestwo percipient witnesses, a chemist, and a paralegal to authenticate dmv records. the prosecutor disclosed the two percipient witnesses nearly two months before trial when the prosecutor told defendant that the was identified the two percipient witnesses who testified at trial. the prosecutor disclosed that the he would be calling a chemist nearly two 2 day of trial that the prosecutor had ignored requests for a copy of the videotape is factually inaccurate. 7 months before trial, explained that he would not know the and did when he obtained it. the prosecutor disclosed that he would be calling a paralegal to authenticate dmv records a week before trial, after defendant changed his position to indicate that he would not stipulate to his prior license suspension documented in the dmv records; the dmv records themselves had been disclosed three months prior to trial, at the preliminary hearing. on these facts, the prosecutor complied with the duty to disclose the names of the . the prosecutor was not obligated to timely disclose in a timely manner their addresses to defendant. (pen. code,  1054.2). defenstatement that he was not obligated to hand over a witness list. to the extent the prosecutor meant he was not required to identify the witnesses, his statement was both legally incorrect (because he was) and irrelevant (because he actually did identify the witnesses); to the extent the prosecutor meant he was not is correct. c. dmv records status . . . obtained as a part of the investigation of the offenses charged. (pen. code,  1054.1, subd. (c).) the prosecutor complied with the duty to disclose the dmv records because an unredacted version of those records was disclosed to the defendant during his preliminary hearing, which was held three months prior to trial. defendant asserts that he did not obtain the records until trial, but that is refuted by the record. 8 d. certified conviction records the certified dui conviction c . . . obtained as a part of prosecutor did not obtain (and hence disclose) a copy of the certified conviction documents until the second half of the birfurcated trial (when litigated), the prosecutor sheet listing all of his prior convictions at the preliminary hearing and gave defendant a copy of that rap sheet three months prior to trial. ii. motion to suppress defendant moved to suppress all evidence from the traffic stop on the ground that it was the product of being stopped in a irements of the vehicle code. on at the preliminary hearing, and denied his renewed motion prior to trial. we regarding the motion for substantial evidence and its ultimate conclusion de novo. (in re raymond c. (2008) 45 cal.4th 303, 306.) the trial court did not err in denying the motion to suppress. we need not decide whether the hill where defendant was speeding constitutes a speed trap within the meaning of vehicle code section 40802 because that determination does not matter for two reasons. first, the vehicle code itself only requires evidence from an unlawful speed trap to be excluded upon a charge involving the spee 40803, subd. (a).) because this is a dui case (and not a speeding ticket case), these provisions do not by their own terms 9 apply. (people v. hardacre (2004) 116 cal.app.4th 1292, 1296-1299.) defendant cites people v. sullivan (1991) 234 cal.app.3d 56 and people v. gray (2011) 199 cal.app.4th supp. 10, but sullivan rested on an earlier version of vehicle code section 40803 that did not limit the exclusion of evidence to speeding charges (sullivan, at pp. 59-60) and gray was depublished. second, violations of state law do not, in any event, affect the propriety of a search or seizure under the fourth amendment. (people v. redd (2010) 48 cal.4th 691, 720, fn. 11; people v. bennett (2011) 197 cal.app.4th 907, 918.) defendant does not challenge the stop under traditional fourth amendment principles, and for good reason: a traffic stop need only be based on reasonable suspicion of a traffic violation (people v. wells (2006) 38 cal.4th 1078, 1082), and there is substantial evidence that defendant was driving at least 20 miles per hour over the speed limit. defendant asserts that speeding cannot provide the basis for the stop because he was not ultimately cited for speeding. but it is well settled its inception if it is based on a reasonable suspicion that any traffic violation has occurred, even if it is ultimately determined brierton v. department of motor vehicles (2005) 130 cal.app.4th 499, 510.) under this law, an did occur does not invalidate a stop. iii. comments during voir dire indisputably correct instructions to the jury on the meaning of 10 3 during vnot intended to be, and [are] not, a substitute for full instructions people v. avila comments in this case as part of the instructions and review them independently as part of the aggregation of all jury instructions . (people v. johnson (2016) 6 cal.app.5th 505, 509-510; people v. holt (1997) 15 cal.4th 619, 677.) tracking the language in the standard calcrim no. 220 instruction, the trial court started by telling the jury venire, proof beyond a reasonable doubt is proof that leaves you with an abiding conviction that the charge is true. the evidence need not eliminate all possible doubt because everything in life is open to some possible o then the court expounded on ight? an alien can 3 in his reply brief, defendant asserts that the trial court also erred in twe all carry that pbecause that statement inappropriately put the jurors in the shoes of an accused defendant. defendant waived this argument by not raising it until his reply brief and by not supplying any authority or reasoned analysis in support. (people v. selivanov (2016) 5 cal.app.5th 726, 794 [waiver if issue raised for first time in reply brief]; in re s.c. (2006) 138 cal.app.4th 396, 408 [waiver if no reasoned analysis of issue].) the argument lacks merit in any event, as the presumption of innocence applies to anyone charged with a crime and does not entail a risk of inflaming the jury. (cf. brokopp v. ford motor co. (1977) 71 cal.app.3d 841, 860 [error to as 11 that reasonable? right? is that reasonable, and do you have an abiding convict -focused illustration of the reasonable doubt standard did not constitute error. the danger that arises when courts add a gloss to the standard reasonable doubt instruction is the danger of diluting the standard in a way that allows a conviction with less certainty than the reasonable doubt standard requires. this is why it is error to liken the reasonable doubt standard to the certainty jurors use in making everyday decisions. (people v. johnson (2004) 119 cal.app.4th 976, 985 [analogies maimproper]; see also people v. johnson (2004) 115 cal.app.4th 1169, 1171- people v. nguyen (1995) 40 cal.app.4th 28, 35-36 [analogies while driving improper].) explaining that jurors do not have a reasonable doubt if the profferehave done creative analogy was a single comment among a charge that quoted the standard reasonable doubt -based example beyond a rea(people v. ochoa (1998) 19 cal.4th 353, 421.) defendant goes on to suggest that any and all deviations from the standard reasonable doubt instructionnot just deviations that dilute the standardmandate reversal. however, the law is to the contrary. (see people v. garcia (1975) 54 cal.app.3d 61, 65-66 [failure to follow standard instruction does not by itself constitute error].) 12 iv. sufficiency of the evidence to prove dui (rather than driving with at least a 0.08 bac), the people must prove (1) defendant drove a vehicle (2) while his ability to drive was actually impaired by alcohol or a drug. (coffey v. shiomoto (2015) 60 cal.4th 1198, 1211; calcrim no. 2110; people v. martinez (2007) 156 cal.app.4th 851, 855.) defendant asserts that insufficient evidence supports this assertion, we ask only whether the record contains evidence that is reasonable, credible, and of solid value sufficient for a reasonable trier of fact to find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. (people v. brooks (2017) 3 cal.5th 1, 57.) in examining the record, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury, accepting all reasonable inferences and resolving all credibility disputes in favor of the verdict. (people v. salazar (2016) 63 cal.4th 214, 242.) sufficient evidence supports defendant was actually impaired while driving, which is the sole ed or erratic 4) testimony that certain blood-alcohol concentrations typically impair the nervous system. (people v. mcneal (2009) 46 cal.4th 1183, 1198; people v. covarrubias (2015) 236 es were bloodshot and watery; defendant was unable to stand without leaning on the car when getting out of the car and was thereafter unable to complete four different field sobriety tests; tests and was driving more than 20 miles per hour over the speed 13 limit on a surface streetto the effect that a 0.155 percent blood-alcohol content has on the nervous system. this evidence of actual impairment was taken to jail, which constitute evidence of consciousness of guilt. (see people v. green (1980) 27 cal.3d 1, 40-41.) defendant levels two challenges at this evidence. first, he argues that the evidence is insufficient because there is no evidence that he was driving erratically. for support, he cites people v. torres (2009) 173 cal.app.4th 977. as a legal matter, and as noted above, erratic driving is not the only way to establish actual impairment. torres is not to the contrary. there, the court overturned a dui conviction based on driving while under the influence of methamphetamines where there was actually impaired hino field sobriety tests and no evidence erraticallysweaty, symptoms of methamphetamiid. at p. 983.) unlike in torres, here there was ample motor skills and judgment, and thus actually impaired his driving. second, defendant contends that some evidence of actual impairment should be discounted. he argues that his poor performance on the field sobriety tests should be disregarded because he had atrophy in his leg, which undermined the results of the tests. this argument has some force with respect to the balance--and-turn 14 -leg standthe horizontal gaze nystagmus test (which looks to eye -to- (which tests upper-body coordination). the latter two tests were sufficient by themselves to establish actual impairment; indeed, the officer testified that the horizontal gaze nystagmus test alone was enough to show actual impairment. defendant next argues that his speeding should be disregarded as proof of erratic driving because he was speeding down a hill. while the downslope might account for speed, the jury could reasonably find that it did not account for the entire 15 to 20 miles per hour excess. his observations about him should be disregarded because the officer was not credible. except in extreme cases where testimony is physically impossible or inherently improbable, however, we people v. prunty (2015) 62 cal.4th 59, 89); the jury did so here, and s it outside the general rule. v. sentencing issues defendant argues that the trial court erred in not staying the driving with at least a 0.08 bac and driving on a suspended license counts under penal code section 654. the people agree, and so do we. penal code section 654 precludes a court from imposing more than one sentence on a single because the driving with at least a 0.08 bac and the dui count, those two counts must be stayed. 15 disposition the convictions are affirmed. the judgment is modified to reflect that the concurrent, three-year sentence on count two is stayed pursuant to penal code section 654, and that the consecutive sentence of 180 days in county jail on count 3 is also stayed pursuant to penal code section 654. the trial court is ordered to prepare and forward the california department of corrections and rehabilitation an abstract of judgment modified accordingly. in all other respects, the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. ______________________, j. hoffstadt we concur: _________________________, p. j. lui _________________________, j. ashmann-gerst
