(see people v. duran (june 22, 2018, b281893) [nonpub. opn.].) we remanded to the trial court in order to permit it to consider whether to exercise its discretion with respect to striking the firearm enhancements, in light of [senate bill no. 620]. (ibid.) senate bill no. 620 amended sections 12022.5 and 12022.53, such that a interest of justice pursuant to section 1385 and at the time of sentencing, strike or dismiss an enhancement otherwise required to be imposed by [sections 12022.5 or 12023.5].

(h).) prior to the enactment of senate bill no. 620 in october 2017and thus at tthese 1 all subsequent statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise indicated. 3 enhancements were mandatory, and the trial court lacked the authority to strike or dismiss them. (see, e.g., people v. kim (2011) 193 cal.app.4th 1355, 13621363, citing former  12022.53, subd. (h).) this court issued its remittitur on september 14, 2018. at an october 31, 2018 hearing that duran attended, the trial court declined to strike the firearm enhancements. the court explained that striking the enhancements would not be in the interests of justice, because this was a case that you shot at people and also hit a car driving down the street . . . . [] . . . [] . . . so this is a very serious case. and, based on the facts, i would exercise my discretion by not striking the firearm duran filed a timely notice of appeal from that decision on november 6, 2018. on january 30, 2018, his appointed counsel filed a wende brief, raising no issues on appeal from the sentencing decision, and requesting that we independently review the record to determine if the lower court committed any error. on the same day, counsel sent to duran a letter explaining her evaluation of the record on appeal and her intention to file a wende brief. this letter enclosed a copy of the record on appeal and informed duran of his right to file a supplemental brief. this court also sent notice to duran of his right to file a supplemental brief within 30 days from the date of the notice; duran did not file a brief within that time frame, or at any point thereafter. 4 discussion the discretion of a trial judge . . . is subject to the limitations of legal principles governing the subject of its action. . . . action that transgresses the confines of the applicable principles of law is outside the scope of discretion and we call such action an city of sacramento v. drew (1989) 207 cal.app.3d 1287, 12971298.) the firearm enhancements under sections 12033.5 and to deter the use of firearmspeople v. chambers (1972) 7 cal.3d 666, 672.) section 1385 affords a judge discretion to in furtherance of justice( 1385, subd. (a); id., subd. (b)(1).) we have reviewed the record on appeal and are satisfied that no arguable appellate issue exists, as the court acted within the scope of its discretion. we are further satisfied that counsel has fully complied with her responsibilities.
