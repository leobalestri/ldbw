(a)(1)) and causing a concealed firearm to be carried in a vehicle (former  12025, subd. (a)(3)).2 accompanying the charges were allegations that appellant had suffered prior convictions constituting strikes under the three strikes law ( 667, subds. (b)-(i), 1170.12, subds. (a)-(d)). at trial, the prosecution presented evidence that on august 9, 2000, deputy sheriffs murray simpkins and daniel spitulski were on routine patrol when they saw a car drive past them containing three persons, including appellant, who was in the right front passenger seat. the car had no front license 1 all further statutory citations are to the penal code. 2 those offenses are now codified in section 29800, subdivi-sion (a)(1), and section 25400, subdivision (a)(3). 3 plate, and appellant was not wearing a seat belt. when the deputy sheriffs directed the car to stop, they saw appellant center. after the car came to a halt, the deputy sheriffs ordered occupants to leave it. simpkins looked inside the car and saw passenger seat. without removing the gun or referring to it, simpkins asked appellantwhat else is in the car?appellant gun.later, appellant told simpkins that the gun belonged appellant further asserted that when marquez tossed the gun to him, he hid it between the seats. the prosecution also presented testimony from marquez, who stated that he neither brought the gun into the car nor had any knowledge of it. according to marquez, when the deputy sheriffs directed him to pull over, he paid no attention to what appellant was doing. after a jury found appellant guilty of being a felon in possession of a firearm and causing a concealed firearm to be carried in a vehicle, the trial court found true the allegations that appellant had suffered two prior convictions for assault with a deadly weapon, a prior conviction for shooting into an occupied vehicle, and a prior conviction for assault and battery by force likely to produce great bodily injury. the court imposed a term of 25 years to life under the three strikes law possession of a firearm, and stayed punishment regarding 4 his conviction for causing a concealed firearm to be carried in a vehicle ( 654). in a partially published opinion, this court affirmed the judgment. (people v. padilla (2002) 98 cal.app.4th 127.) b. petition for recall of sentence in 2012, the electorate enacted the reform act by approving proposition 36. (people v. yearwood (2013) 213 cal.app.4th 161, 167-170.) the reform act amended the three strikes law to provide that absent specified exceptions, an offender with two or more prior strikes is to be sentenced as a two-strike offender unless the new offense also is a strike, that is, a serious or violent felony.3 (see ibid.) the reform act also added section 1170.126, which creates a post-conviction resentencing proceeding for specified inmates sentenced under the prior version of the three strikes law. (people v. yearwood, supra, at pp. 167-170.) under that statute, a defendant sentenced as a three-strike offender may petition for recall of the sentence and for resentencing, but is subject to certain eligibility criteria.

(id. at p. 1030.) numerous courts have determined that under the reform act, the offense of being a felon in possession of a firearm falls under the pertinent eligibility exclusion when the possession in question amounted to arming, as specified in bland. (e.g., people v. white (2014) 223 cal.app.4th 512, 524-525; cervantes, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at pp. 1012-1018; osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at pp. 1028-1038; people v. blakely (2014) 225 cal.app.4th 1042, 1051-1057; people v. elder (2014) 227 cal.app.4th 1308, 1312-1314 & fn. 7 (elder); people v. brimmer (2014) 230 cal.app.4th 782, 793-799; people v. hicks (2014) 231 cal.app.4th 275, 283-284 (hicks).) instructive discussions of the exclusion are found in osuna, elder, and hicks. in osuna, the defendant drove his car at an excessive speed and refused to yield to a police officer who tried to pull him over. (osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1027.) the defendant eventually stopped, left his car while holding a gun, and fled into a house. (ibid.) after arresting the defendant, officers found an unloaded nine-millimeter gun hidden in the house and nine-millimeter ammunition in the car. (ibid.) the defendant was convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm and obstructing a police officer, and was sentenced as a three strike offender. (id. at pp. 1026- 9 1027.) when the defendant sought resentencing, the trial court determined that he was ineligible for relief because he was armed with a firearm during the commission of his firearm. (osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1028.) in affirming that ruling, the appellate court concluded that the offense did not, by itself, render the defendant ineligible absent a showing that he was armed, as defined in bland, viz., that the firearm was available to him for offensive or defensive use. (id. at p. 1030.) the court recognized that ing a gun available does not further or aid in the commission of the crime of possession of a firearm by a (id. at p. 1032.) the court determined that the exclusion demands only a temporal nexus -- but no facilitative nexus -- between the arming and the offense of being a felon in possession of a firearm, as the exclusion merely requires that unlike the enhancement construed in bland, which requires (id. at pp. 1032-1033.) in elder, police officers executing a search warrant for an apartment found the defendant standing outside the apartment. (elder, supra, 227 cal.app.4th at p. 1317.) the defendant admitted that he lived there. (ibid.) inside the apartment, the officers discovered two guns and a photo of 10 the defendant holding one of them.

(id. at p. 1311.) following the denial of his petition for resentencing, he . . require[s] something on decisions interpreting the enhancement discussed in bland. (id. at p. 1312.) in affirming the denial of the petition, the appellate court rejected that contention, stating: reasoning rests on its conflating the criterial definition of an ineligible offense (being armed during the commission of such offense) with the derivative nature of the armed enhancement (which requires being armed in id. at pp. 1312-1313.) in hicks, police officers frisked the defendant after he appeared to throw away a bag containing drugs, and found he had several .380 caliber bullets. (hicks, supra, 231 cal.app.4th at pp. 280-281.) when the officers searched a nearby apartment, they found a backpack containing a loaded .380 caliber gun. (ibid.) a witness told the officers that the defendant had carried the backpack into the apartment. (ibid.) the defendant was convicted of possession of a firearm as a felon and sentenced as a three strike offender on the basis of that offense. (ibid.) later, the concluding that he was armed with a firearm when he 11 committed the offense of possessing a firearm as a felon. (id. at pp. 279-280, 284.) the appellate court affirmed that ruling, applying an interpretation of the exclusion identical to that set forth in osuna. (id. at pp. 283-284.) in construing the exclusion, t (id. at p. 283.) the court explained that although the contention would be correct if directed at the arming enhancement discussed in bland, it failed in light of the plain language of the exclusion, which concerns eligibility for reduced punishment. (ibid.) as the court noted, the exclusion requires no facilitative nexus between the arming and any offense. (ibid.) here, the record establishes that appellant was armed with a firearm -- that is, had a gun available to him for offensive or defensive use -- during his possession of the firearm as a felon.5 the evidence submitted in connection 5 as the resentencing provisions of section 1170.126 do not require that the eligibility facts have been resolved by the verdicts or special findings rendered at trial, many decisions have concluded that the trial court may independently examine the record of conviction in order to make determinations regarding those facts. (e.g., white, supra, 223 cal.app.4th at pp. 526-527; osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1020; people v. manning (2014) 226 cal.app.4th 1133, 1139-1144; elder, supra, 227 cal.app.4th at pp. 1314-1336; bradford, supra, 227 cal.app.4th at pp. 1338-1340; brimmer, supra, 230 cal.app.4th at pp. 799-801; hicks, supra, 231 cal.app.4th at p. 275.) this court reached (fn. continues on the next page.) 12 n was sufficient to show that he personally concealed the gun the deputy sheriffs found front seats. (see cervantes, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at pp. 1011-being a felon in possession of a firearm rendered him ineligible for resentencing under the reform act when the appellant contends the pertinent exclusion, viewed in the context of the reform act, must be interpreted to require a facilitative nexus between arming and an offense independent of the crime of being a felon in possession of a firearm. under the reform act, subdivision (e)(2) of section 1170.126 provides that a defendant is not eligible for resentencing if his or her current sentence was imposed for an offense appearing in three provisions stated in materially identical terms in both sections 667 and 1170.12 ( 667, subd. (e)(2)(c)(i) - (iii), 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(c)(i)-(iii)). of those three provisions, two enumerate particular offenses rendering a defendant ineligible for resentencing. ( 667, subd. (e)(2)(c)(i) - (ii), 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(c)(i)-(ii).) the remaining provision, which incorporates the exclusion at ithe commission of the current offense, the defendant used a the same conclusion in a recent decision (people v. frierson (2016) 1 cal.app.5th 788, 791-793, review granted oct. 19, 2016, s236728). 13 firearm, was armed with a firearm or deadly weapon, or ( 667, subd. (e)(2)(c)(iii), 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(c)(iii).) appellant maintains that the structure of the three provisions establishes that the pertinent exclusion applies only when the arming is related to, or promotes, an offense other than being a felon in possession of a firearm. he where the statute is meant to exclude specific offenses entirely, it so states, but where it is meant to exclude an offense only if something beyond its mere commission occurs, it states during the commission of the offense something else happens.the current offense as an addition and not just be an element during the commission of the current offenseanother disagree. although the third provision specifies circumstances rendering the current offense ineligible for resentencing, nothing in it suggests that those circumstances must attach to a crime other than the current offense. as noted in bradfordwhich the defendant seeks resentencing. (bradford, supra, 227 cal.app.4th at p. 1332.) the provision thus encom-passes the offense of being a felon in possession of a firearm when the manner in which that crime was committed 14 involved arming. appellant also contends eligibility exclusion must be construed as having the same in,construed in bland. to support that contention, appellant to express a purely temporal relationship. he directs our attention to people v. poroj (2010) 190 cal.app.4th 165, 176 and people v. valdez (2010) 189 cal.app.4th 82, 90, which examined an enhancement in section 12022.7, subdivision (a), applicable to defendants who personally inflict great criminal conduct and the injury. (poroj, supra, at pp. 172-176; valdez, supra, at p. 90.) blandfacilitatipurely temporal meaning. (merriam-a purely temporal meaning does not show that the word facilitative relationship in addition to a temporal one. 15 appellant also contends that so construing the eligibility exclusion would frustrate the goals of proposition 36. he asserts that in approving proposition 36, the electorate did not intend to deny relief to offenders convicted of possessing a firearm as a felon, which he characterizes as -to give lesser sentences to the less dangerous felons while making sure that the truly dangerous felons were kept behind bars. . . . [] having a weapon readily available for use generally does not render a person truly dangerous; it is a right protected by the federal constitution. it only becomes dangerous when it might facilitate a crime, when it might be used for violence. election materials relating to proposition 36, which state that it was not intended to afford relief to offenders who committed -involved firearm possession.cervantes, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1016, italics omitted.) as explained in elder, although possession of a gun of itself is not criminal, a possession of a gun is not a crime that is merely malum prohibitum. . . . momentary possession of guns by convicted felons who, the [citation.] therefore, even if the great majority of commitments for unlawful gun possession come within our interpretation of this eligibility criterion, it would not run elder, supra, 227 cal.app.4th at 16 p. 1314, quoting people v. pepper (1996) 41 cal.app.4th 1029, 1037-1038.) in sum, the trial court did not err in resentencing.6 6 in a related contention, appellant suggests that the interpretation placed on the exclusion by osuna and the other explain why the electorahad access to a weapon instead of making such an exclusion clear by including the weapon possession crimes in the list of crimes for which resentencing is prohibited . . . .excluding anyone who had access to a weaponbeen construed judicially to convey a facilitative nexus. for the reasons discussed above, we reject both arguments. because proposition 36 reflects an intent to deny relief for offenders convicted of -related felonies,the exclusion is - in temporal terms, that is, by means of the nexus. 17 disposition the order of the trial court is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports manella, j. we concur: epstein, p. j. collins, j.
