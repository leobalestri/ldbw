(pen. code,  459 (count 1), 1170.18, subd. (a); veh. code,  10851, subd. (a) (count 2).)1 we affirm. factual and procedural background a preconviction probation report prepared for an april 6, 2011 hearing indicates as follows. on march 15, 2011, appellant broke into a wardrobe building at six flags magic mountain (six flags), stole a batman costume and a flash gordon costume, and put them in his vehicle. he later broke into a los angeles six flags uniform. an alarm went off, which appellant silenced by ripping it from the wall. he also stole, and put on, a security officer uniform. appellant further stole a ford maintenance vehicle belonging to six flags and drove away in it. deputies received a call regarding the substation burglary. they went to the substation, appellant tried to escape in the maintenance vehicle, but they detained him. the report states appellant admitted sneaking onto the property by blending in with a crowd of employees, taking the character costumes and security uniform, and taking another character costume from six flags one month earlier. the report also states the character costumes were found in appellantvehicle, and he possessed several keys, a large wrench, a utility belt and drill bits, and two black markers. 1 unless otherwise indicated, subsequent section references are to the penal code. 3 the probation report described six property loss as follows. costumes; a uniform; a maintenance vehicle and damaged a locker totaling $12,500. it appears the vehicle, costumes and the report described asbox - on april 27, 2011, appellant entered into a negotiated plea bargain. he entered no contest pleas to second degree commercial burglary and unlawful driving or taking of a vehicle, and the court sentenced him to prison for concurrent two-year terms for the convictions. in january 2015, appellant later filed a proposition 47 within the meaning of section 1170.18, subdivision (a).2 on february 17, 2015, the court held a hearing on the petition. appellant was not present in court but both parties were represented by counsel, and each counsel represented she had reviewed the file. 2 the petition is not part of the appellate record. a superior found after a thorough search of the superior court file, inquiries sent to the prosecutor and defense attorney. the january 2015 filing date for the petition is reflected in the january 20, 2015, minute order, of which we take judicial notice. (evid. code,  452, subd. (d)(1).) 4 the prosecutor argued appellantnot subject to relief because proposition 47 required burglary of a the prosecutor represented, it appears from reading the file that [appellant] broke into a section of [six flags] not open to the the vehicle code section 10851, subdivision (a) conviction was not subject to proposition 47 relief. prosecutor representedmaintenance vehicle. so they caught him and charged him with responded: your honor, i had a chance to review the file. in addition the loss estimated on the case was well over $1,200. in addition to everything else the (sic.) the court concluded the brief hearing by stating: i concur with that, having reviewed the file, and will deny the petition. the minute order not eligible for relief pursuant to proposition 47 and the petition is d issues appellant claims (1) proposition 47 permits resentencing of a violation of vehicle code section 10851, subdivision (a) to petty theft when the value of the vehicle does not exceed $950, (2) the people bore, and failed to carry, the burden of proving appellant was ineligible for proposition 47 relief, and (3) the resentencing court erroneously considered evidence beyond the record of conviction when making its eligibility determination. 5 discussion 1. there is no need to decide whether proposition 47 permits resentencing of a violation of vehicle code section 10851, subdivision (a) to petty theft. appellant claims proposition 47 permits resentencing of a violation of vehicle code section 10851, subdivision (a) to misdemeanor petty theft when the value of the vehicle does not exceed $950. alternatively, appellant claims equal protection guarantees require equivalent relief. there is conflicting appellate authority as to whether proposition 47 permits such resentencing. in people v. haywood (2015) 243 cal.app.4th 515 [198 cal.rptr.3d 40], review granted march 9, 2016, s232250 (haywood), the court held that subdivision (a)] is . . . not a qualifying offense [under section 1170.18, subdivision (a)] under any circumstance. (haywood, at p. 523.) on the other hand, the court in people v. ortiz (2016) 243 cal.app.4th 854 [196 cal.rptr.3d 894], review granted march 16, 2016, s232344 (ortiz), stated, defendant convicted under [vehicle code section] 10851 may be eligible for proposition 47 resentencing if he or she can show the offense qualifies as a petty theft under section 490.2. ortiz expressly disagreed with haywood. (ortiz, at p. 860.) 6 our supreme court has granted review of this issue in people v. page (2015) 241 cal.app.4th 714 [194 cal.rptr.3d 164], review granted january 27, 2016, s230793. but there is no need for us to await resolution of the issues raised by appellant. as discussed in the sections below, we conclude for other reasons was proper and should be affirmed. 2. appellant failed to meet his burden of proving he was eligible for proposition 47 relief. appellant claims the people had the burden of proving he was ineligible for proposition 47 relief and failed to carry their burden. we disagree. a. appellant had the burden of proving his eligibility. our supreme court recently addressed the burden of proof on an eligibility determination under proposition 47 in people v. romanowski (2017) 2 cal.5th 903 (romanowski). the court made it clear that the petitioner has the burden, by stating: context of a section 1170.18 petition to recall a sentence? the ultimate burden of proving section 1170.18 eligibility lies with the petitioner. (romanowski, at p. 916; accord, people v. sherow (2015) 239 cal.app.4th 875, 880 (sherow) [e think it is entirely appropriate to allocate the initial burden of proof to the petitioner to establish the facts upon ]3.) 3 sherow was cited with approval by the supreme court (romanowski, supra, 2 cal.5th at p. 916), and it has been widely followed by appellate courts (see, e.g., people v. pak (2016) 3 cal.app 5th 1111, 1117; people v. johnson (2016) 1 cal.app 5th 953, 961 (johnson)). 7 appellant therefore had the burden of proving he was eligible for proposition 47 relief. none of the cases cited by appellant compel a contrary conclusion, as they all were decided before the supreme cromanowski. b. appellant failed to meet his burden. the next issue is whether appellant met his burden. as to proposition 47 eligibility determinations, we review the findings for substantial evidence. (people v. perkins (2016) 244 cal.app.4th 129, 136-137 (perkins).) appellant contends he is entitled to resentencing of his second degree burglary conviction because the facts of his conviction establish that the offense would have been shoplifting under newly enacted statutory provisions. resentencing in accordance with . . . section 45shoplifting is defined as entering a commercial establishment with intent to commit larceny while that establishment is open during regular business hours, where the value of the property that is taken or intended to be taken does not exceed nine is primarily engaged in commerce, that is, the buying and selling of goods or (in re j.l. (2015) 242 cal.app.4th 1108, 1114.) 8 appellant also contends he is entitled to resentencing of his vehicle code section 10851, subdivision (a) conviction because the facts of his conviction establish that the offense would have been petty theft under newly enacted statutory provisions. according to appellant, section 1170.18, subdivision (a) permits resentencing a felony sentence of a violation of vehicle code section 10851, subdivision (a) to misdemeanor petty theft where . . . personal property taken does not exceed appellant did not sustain his burden of proving either of these grounds in the trial cconviction, the record contains no evidence that the wardrobe 459.5, subdivision (a). the value of the property that is taken or intended to be taken does of that subdivision. regardi10851, subdivision (a) conviction, the record contains no evidence subdivision (a). we therefore hold appellant failed to meet his burden of proving he was eligible for proposition 47 relief as to either of his convictions. the trial court record contains evidence that appellant was not eligible for proposition 47 relief. as to the burglary conviction, the probation report indicates appellant broke into a which are not open commercial establishments. in addition, the probation report 9 described losses that greatly exceeded $950 for both victims. it said six flags experienced losses of $12,500, and department suffered a loss of $1,200. supporting evidence was so lacking that defense counsel flatly admitted appellant was ineligible for proposition 47 relief during the trial court proceedings. after the prosecutor the court accepted the positions of both counsel and denied the petition. the statement admission that appellant was, on multiple grounds, ineligible for proposition 47 relief. (see people v. jackson (2005) 129 treated as judicial admissions if intended, or reasonably construed by the court or other party, as such].) appellant does not claim his counsel at the proposition 47 hearing rendered ineffective assistance of counsel on any matter, including as, on multiple grounds, ineligible for proposition 47 relief. we accordingly conclude the denial of the petition as to failure to sustain his burden of proof, evidence of his ineligibility, and his admission he was ineligible for proposition 47 relief.4 4 in his reply brief, appellant argues for the first time that because the petition was misplaced and there is no record of what appellant included in his petition. we reject this argument. is axiomatic that arguments made for the first time in a reply brief will not be entertained because of the unfairness to the 10 3. the resentencing court did not erroneously consider evidence beyond the record of conviction. appellant claims the trial court erroneously considered evidence beyond the record of conviction by reviewing a probation report in making the proposition 47 eligibility determination. we reject his claim. as an initial matter, it is not entirely clear whether the court reviewed or relied upon the probation report. during the resentencing heathe attorneys and the court merely stated they each had reviewed never expressly stated it had read the probation report. the burden is on appellant to demonstrate error from the record, and error will not be presumed. (in re kathy p. (1979) 25 cal.3d 91, 102; people v. garcia (1987) 195 cal.app.3d 191, 198.) but even if the court went beyond the record of conviction and relied upon the probation report, it was not error. in romanowski, our supreme court recognized that a proposition 47 eligibility hearing may include matters that go beyond the people v. rangel (2016) 62 cal.4th 1192, 1218-1219.) moreover, appellant has failed to demonstrate that critical evidence or a substantial part of a [record] is irretrievably lost or destroyed, and there is no alternative way to provide an adequate record so that the appellate court may pass (people v. galland (2008) 45 cal.4th 354, 370, italics added.) finally, there was no prejudice, for reasoning similar to that supporting our conclusion in part 3 of our discussion. (see people v. townsel (2016) 63 cal.4th 25, 69-70 [prejudice standard enunciated in people v. watson (1956) 46 cal.2d 818, 836 (watson) applies to any state law error].) 11 uncontested information in the petition and record of conviction may be enough for the petitioner to establish this eligibility. . . . but in other cases, eligibility for resentencing may turn on facts that are not established by either the uncontested petition or the record of conviction. in these cases, an evidentiary hearing may any denial, any affidavits or declarations under penalty of perjury, and matters of which judicial notice may be taken, the court finds there is a reasonable likelihood that the petitioner may be entitled to relief and the petitioentitlement to relief (cal. rules of (romanowski, supra, 2 cal.5th at p. 916, italics added.) appellate courts have repeatedly rejected the argument that proposition 47 proceedings are limited to the bare record of conviction. in johnson, the court explained, created misdemeanors either that did not exist previously (e.g.,  459.5 [shoplifting]) or that were felony offenses with different showings required (e.g.,  496, subd. (a) [receiving stolen property]), there is no reason to believe that the electorate intended to limit the resentencing courreview to the (johnson, supra, 1 cal.app.5th at p. 967; accord, people v. huerta (2016) 3 cal.app.5th 539, 544, fn. 3; people v. salmorin (2016) 1 cal.app.5th 738, 744; perkins, supra, 244 cal.app.4th at p. 140, fn. 5.) in people v. sledge (2017) 7 cal.app.5th 1089, 1096-1098 (sledge), the court expressly held the trial court did not commit error by relying upon a probation report in denying a petition 12 under proposition 47. the court explaan eligibility hearing is a type of sentencing proceeding. nothing in proposition 47 suggests the applicable rules of evidence are any different than those which apply to other types of sentencing proceedings. accordingly, limited use of hearsay such as that found in probation reports is permitted, provided there is a substantial basis for believing the hearsay information is reliable. (id. at p. 1095.) there is certainly no basis to view the probation report in this case as unreliable. the parties utilized it when appellant entered into his negotiated plea on april 27, 2011. at the proposition 47 hearing on february 17, 2015, the prosecutor and defense counsel both referred to facts consistent with the contents of the probation report. even in this appeal, appellant has referred to the probation report in summarizing the underlying facts. to the extent the trial court relied upon the report, there was no error. and any error was harmless in view of appellantfailure to demonstrate his eligibility and his admission, through his counsel, that he was not eligible for proposition 47 relief. (cf. watson, supra, 46 cal.2d at p. 836; johnson, supra, 1 cal.app.5th at p. 968.)5 5 appellant also contends he was entitled to a jury trial on his proposition 47 eligibility, with proof beyond a reasonable doubt as the standard of proof. this argument has been repeatedly rejected. (see sledge, supra, 7 cal.app.5th, at p. 1095; people v. jefferson (2016) 1 cal.app.5th 235, 241; people v. rivas-colon (2015) 241 cal.app.4th 444, 451.) we do the same. 13 disposition the petition for a recall of sentence is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports johnson, (michael) j. we concur: lavin, acting p. j. aldrich, j.** * judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution. ** retired associate justice of the court of appeal, second appellate district, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution
