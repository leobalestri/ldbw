vasquez was wounded. los angeles police officer scott smith responded to the scene and recovered several .380 live rounds and multiple nine-millimeter bullets, casings and fragments. smith also identified clover street gang graffiti near the scene. cabrera died from multiple gunshot wounds, most of which entered his body from behind. four bullets and several fragments were removed fautopsy. all the nine-millimeter bullets retrieved at the scene and recovered from on august 5, 2001 los angeles police officer christopher patterson was on patrol when his attention was called to a jeep parked on the side of the road. anguiano approached the car and told patterson the car belonged to him. patterson found a nine- 3 millimeter glock loaded with an 18-anguiano admitted ownership of the gun and identified himself as a member of the dogtown gang, a rival of the clover street gang.1 patterson confiscated the gun and until 2007. at that time, it was found to match the bullets, casings and fragments recovered from the cabrera shooting. ramos, who saw the shooter only from the nose up as his face was partially covered, was unable to identify anguiano in a photographic lineup shown to her shortly after the shooting. shown a second photographic lineup on september 18, 2007roughly six years after the crimeramos identified anguiano as the shooter. 2. the 2007 shooting in the early morning of april 14, 2007 presciliana juarez and shurnell west, a clover street gang member, left a restaurant located at 20th street and north broadway near downtown los angeles with another couple also associated with the clover street gang. juarez drove; west was in the passenger seat. as they headed toward the on the passenger side by a blue minivan. as the minivan drew close, a man wearing a om the open sliding door of the van. juarez drove faster to escape, but the van followed. juarez braked; and, as the minivan passed, she locked eyes with the driver, who was also wearing a black sweatshirt. realizing west had been shot, juarez drove directly to a hospital drive. west died from a gunshot wound to the chest. as los angeles police officer david gomez drove toward the hospital in response to the shooting, he saw a light colored minivan parked near the corner of 2nd 1 los angeles police officer adrian lopez, testifying at trial as a gang expert, explained the dogtown gang claimed the area just north of downtown los angeles. the clover gang claimed the area on the east side of the los angeles river, the dividing line between the two rival gangs. 4 street and zonal avenue. when gomez approached, a man got out of the minivan, crossed the street and fled; the minivan sped off. gomez pursued the minivan until it came to a stop near an overpass. a hispanic man wearing a dark colored jacket and carrying a bag got out of the minivan and ran toward a fence separating the road from the nearby railroad tracks. gomez saw an object fall from the bag as the man ran. the man threw the bag over the fence, climbed after it and ran down the railroad tracks. after additional officers arrived at the location, gomez proceeded to the hospital and brought juarez back to the minivan. juarez identified the minivan as the one involved in the shooting and also identified the black sweatshirt with flames on the sleeves found inside. a cell phone belonging to michael godinez was recovered next to the minivan. toys, a soda cup with a straw and lid, a chocolate chip bag, a compact disc and a helmet. on the chocolate chip bag, compact disc and helmet. two days later police recovered a backpack on the other side of the overpass near the tracks. the backpack, which -year-gang-related markings. inside, police found a nine-millimeter gun, ammunition and two magazinesidentified anguiano as the driver of the minivan in a photographic lineup. during a search of anguiaanguiano with others in dogtown gang apparel, a firearm cleaning kit and a weapon magazine holder. additional photographs showed anguiano and other gang members, including godinez, displaying gang signs while carrying the casket of another gang members of the dogtown gang. 5 3. the information anguiano was charged in an information with the july 1, 2001 murder of cabrera (pen. code,  187, subd. (a)),2 and the attempted murder of vasquez ( 187, subd. (a), 664, subd. (a)), as well as the april 14, 2007 murder of west ( 187, subd. (a)) and shooting at an occupied motor vehicle ( 246). the information specially alleged as to all counts anguiano had personally and intentionally discharged a firearm causing death or great bodily injury within the meaning of section 12022.53, subdivisions (b) through (d) rection of, or in association with any criminal street gang, with the specific intent to promote, further, 186.22, subd. (b)(4)). in addition, the information alleged two special circumstances under section 190.2, subdivision (a): perpetrated by means of discharging a firearm from a motor vehicle, intentionally at the people did not seek the death penalty. 4. anguiano filed a motion to sever trial on the 2001 crimes (counts 1 and 2) from trial on the 2007 crimes (counts 3 and 4), arguing the crimes were not connected, shared combination of the charges subjected him to an additional special circumstance for multiple murders under section 190.2, subdivision (a)(3). the trial court denied the motion, finding the crimes to be of the same class and the people did not appear to be o cross-motive was a significant link between the two shootings. the court concluded joinder would not be unduly inflammatory or prejudicial. 2 statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise specified. 6 5. trial, verdicts and sentencing anguiano did not present any evidence in his defense. the jury convicted him on all counts and found all special allegations to be true. he was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole on the 2001 murder conviction (count 1), plus an additional term of 25 years to life for the firearm enhancement on that count. the court imposed the identical, consecutive sentence on the second murder conviction (count 3), that is, life without the possibility of parole plus 25 years to life. on the attempted murder conviction (count 2), anguiano was sentenced to a consecutive term of life in prison plus 25 years to life for the firearm enhancement. the court also imposed an additional 15 years for the gang enhancement. sentence on the section 246 conviction (count 4) was stayed under section 654. discussion 1. sever a. governing law section 954 permits two or more offenses of the same class or connected together in their comconsolidation or joinder of charged offenses ordinarily promotes efficiency, that is the alcala v. superior court (2008) 43 cal.4th 1205, 1220 (alcala).)3 when the statutory requirements for joinder have been met, the defendant can demonstrate error in the denial of a motion to sever only by a clear showing of potential prejudice. (ibid.; people v. soper (2009) 45 cal.4th 759, 774 (soper).) 3 the efficiency and benefits of a joint trial were described in people v. bean (1988) 46 cal.3d 919, 939-attaches. only one group of jurors need serve, and the expenditure of time for jury voir dire and trial is greatly reduced over that required were the cases separately tried. in addition, the public is served by the reduced delay on disposition of criminal charges both 7 alcala, at p. 1220; accord, soper, at p. 774.) ther a trial court abused its discretion under section 954 in -admissibility of the evidence in hypothetical separate trials. [citation.] if the evidence underlying the charges in question would be cross-admissible, that factor alone is normally sufficient to dispel any charges. [citation.] moreover, even if the evidence underlying these charges would not be cross-admissible in hypothetical separate trials, that determination would not itself establish prejudice or an abuse of discretion by the trial court in declining to sever soper, supra, 45 cal.4th at pp. 774-775.) not be cross-substantial to outweigh --[citations.] in making that assessment, we consider three additional factors, any of whichcombined with our earlier determination of absence of cross-admissibilityare particularly likely to inflame the jury against the defendant; (2) whether a weak case has been joined with a strong case or another weak case so that the totality of the evidence may alter the outcome as to some or all of the charges; or (3) whether one of the charges (but not another) is a capital offense, or the joinder of the charges converts the matter into a capital case. [citations.] we then balance the potential for prejudice to the soper, supra, 45 cal.4th at p. 775; see alcala, supra, 43 cal.4th at pp. 1220-1222.) b. cross-admissibility as anguiano concedes, the statutory requirements for joinder were met in this case because the 2001 and 2007 crimes both involved murders and thus were of the same 8 class. (see  954; soper, supra, 45 cal.4th at p. 771.) nonetheless, he argues, joinder was improper because none of the evidence would have been cross-admissible had the charges been separately filed. in terms of a severance motion, cross-pertinent to one case [would] have been admissible in the other under the rules of evidence which limit the use of character evidence or prior similar acts to prove conduct people v. johnson (1988) 47 cal.3d 576, 589; accord, soper, supra, 45 cal.4th at pp. 776-here exists a continuum concerning the degree of similarity required for cross-admissibility, depending upon the purpose for which introduction of the evidence is sought: . . is required in order to prove intent. [citation.] . . . in order to be admissible [for that purpose], the uncharged misconduct must be sufficiently similar to support the inference soper, at p. 776, fn. omitted; see people v. ewoldt (1994) 7 cal.4th 380, 403.) nonetheless, a would be necessary to exclude other-people v. arias (1996) 13 cal.4th 92, 127.)4 4 ewoldt are relevant to the analysis governing admissibility, but both the burden of proof relating to admissibility and the assessment of prejudice are different in the context of properly joined charged alcala, supra, 43 cal.4th properly joined charges as compared with cases involving the introduction of uncharged misconduct [under evidence code section 1001, subdivision (b)], but the nature of the abuse of discretion standardand the ensuing method utilized to analyze prejudice, undertaken to determine whether a trial court abused its discretion in a specific casealso are significantly different from what is employed in determining whether a trial court soper, supra, 45 cal.4th at p. 774.) 9 admission to a police officer that he was a member of the dogtown gang would have been admissible against him in a trial on the 2007 charges. similarly, a gang expert could testify to the rivalry between the dogtown and clover gangs whether the trial involved both incidents or was limited to the 2001 or 2007 shootings. (see, e.g., people v. castenada of the crimes defendant here committed, his many contacts on previous occasions with the goldenwest criminal street gang, and his admissions by bragging to police officers of participation]; people v. olguin (1994) 31 cal.app.4th 1355, 1384 [affirming use of expert testimony to establish gang for expert explication than that presented by a subculture in which this type of mindless people v. carr (2010) 190 cal.app.4th 475, 489 ang membership and gang-expert testimony supported imposition of gang special circumstance].) the trial court recognized the evidence of -intent for both shootings but noted it would hardly be probative to string together a number of gang-related crimes and charge them jointly simply because of the gang distinctive as to be like a signatpeople v. ewoldt, supra, 7 cal.4th at p. 403), and cannot be relied upon to support an inference of identity. thus, notwithstanding the persuasiveness of the gang motive in this casethe persistent gang rivalry that fostered two brutally anonymous murdersthe trial court was properly cautious in assuming cross-admissibility of gang evidence to support intent was, standing alone, sufficient to justify denial of the motion to sever. c. other factors weigh heavily in favor of joinder nonetheless, the factors to be weighed in consideration of a motion to severwhether a charge is unusually likely to inflame the jury; whether a weak case has been paired with a strong case; and whether joinder will convert the matter into a capital caseall favor joinder in this case. neither of the shootings was more inflammatory 10 than the other: to the contrary, were the type of shooting here less common, the similarities between the two crimes would warrant an inference of common identity and favor cross-admissibility. extinguishes any prejudice associated with that consideration. anguiano argues, however, that stronger evidence supported the 2007 crimes and, thus, prejudiced his defense of the 2001crimes, for which strong evidence of his participation was lacking. this contention is meritless. even if there was no dna or fingerprint evidence of the sort available for the 2007 shooting, anguiano had admitted in 2001 to ownership of the murder weapon, and ramos identified himalbeit six years later2001 murder was the failure of the police to submit his nine-millimeter handgun for ballistics testing. consequently, even if the evidence of his participation in the 2007 crimes was stronger, the evidence he was the shooter in the 2001 crimes was sufficiently strong that he did not suffer undue prejudice by joinder of the charges for trial. 2. due process rights court must reverse the judgment if the defendant shows joinder actually resulted in gross unfairness amounting to a denial of due process. (soper, supra, 45 cal.4th at p. 783.) in considering this question, the reviewing court examines the impact at trial of the joinder by looking at the evidence actually introduced at trialthe independent evidence of the f the evidence from the joined charges. (see people v. turner (1984) 37 cal.3d 302, 313, overruled on another ground in people v. anderson (1987) 43 cal.3d 1104, 1149-1150; people v. geier (2007) 41 cal.4th 555, 575-576; people v. macklem (2007) 149 cal.app.4th 674, 698.) the defendant, of people v. sandoval (1992) 4 cal.4th 155, 174.) anguiano contends joinder of the crimes created jury prejudice as the 2001 evidence supporting the 2007 charges, the evidence presented need not be completely 11 identical in strength for a joinder to be appropriately free from prejudice. (see people v. breault (1990) 223 cal.app.3d 125, 133-134) [joinder was proper even thought the evidence was not cross-admissible and evidence on one charge stronger than evidence in support of others]; people v. ruiz (1988) 44 cal.3d 589, 604-607 [joinder of two murder the jury would have reached a different conclusion had the trial been severed, and anguiano has failed to show denial of severance deprived him of a fair trial. 3. the 15-year term imposed for the gang enhancement must be stricken at sentencing, with respect to count 2 the trial court concluded it was required to a minimum parole eligibility term of 15 years for conviction of gang-related crimes judgment both indicate the court had imposed an additional 15-year term as a gang pronouncement of sentence was correct. when the underlying gang-related felony already carries (people v. lopez (2005) 34 cal.4th 1002, 1004; accord, people v. johnson (2003) 109 cal.app.4th 1230, 1239; people v. harper (2003) 109 cal.app.4th 520, 527.) generally, when there is a discrepancy between the oral pronouncement of judgment and the minute order, the oral pronouncement controls. (people v. mitchell (2001) 26 cal.4th 181, 185-186.) moreover, the people have conceded the additional 15-year prison term for the gang enhancement should be stricken. (see people v. scott (1994) 9 cal.4th 331, 354 [unauthorized sentence can be properly corrected on appeal].) 12 disposition the judgment is modified by striking the 15-year term imposed as a gang enhancement on count 2 (the attempted murder of danny vasquez), leaving the sentence on that count as a consecutive term of life in prison, with a minimum parole eligibility of 15 calendar years, plus 25 years to life for the firearm enhancement. as modified, the judgment is affirmed. the superior court is directed to prepare a corrected abstract of judgment and to forward it to the department of corrections and rehabilitation. perluss, p. j. we concur: zelon, j. jackson, j.
