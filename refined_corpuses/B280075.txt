(people v. wende (1979) 25 cal.3d 436.) on october 17, 2017, we sent letters to torres and appointed counsel directing counsel to forward the appellate record to torres and advising him that within 30 days he could personally submit any contentions or issues he wished us to consider. we received no response from torres. on december 14, 2017, we sent a letter to counsel for torres and the people requesting briefing on five questions: to each of the two separate cases . . . contrary to . . . section 2900.5, subdivision (b)? if so, did application of the sentencing credits to each of the two separate cases constitute error? pursuant to . . . section 4019? to state prison for violations of . . . section 530.5, subdivision (c)(2)? respect, may we correct the sentence on appeal from the execution of the suspended sentence upon termination of it appears from our docket that after we requested supplemental briefing, counsel requested that the trial court forward to this court the trial court files from each of the two cases on appeal. we have received and reviewed those files. 5 discussion i. application of sentencing credits of this section, credit shall be given only where the custody to be credited is attributable to proceedings related to the same conduct for which the defendant has been convicted. credit shall be given only once for a single period of custody attributable to the abstracts of judgment on the two cases each reflect 814 days of credit. it is clear from that the trial court intended that the sentencing credits be applied only once. pronouncement of judgment and the minute order or the abstract of judgment, the oral pronoupeople v. walz (2008) 160 cal.app.4th 1364, 1367, fn. 3.) we will, therefore, order the trial court to correct the discrepancy between the trial amended abstract of judgment omitting the sentencing credits mistakenly included in the abstract of judgment for the 092 case. (see people v. mitchell (2001) 26 cal.4th 181, 187-188.) ii. calculation of sentencing credits both torres and the people contend the trial court miscalcuthe trial court awarded a total of 814 credits to torres, including 569 for time served (including the 162 time served and 162 conduct credits the trial court initially granted when imposing and suspenof actual custody (miscalculated from may 13, 2016 to december 23, 2016), and 245 days of conduct credit based on the actual 6 custody miscalculation. the people contend, and we agree, that if the custody credits are properly calculated with 324 days of back time, 225 days of actual custody, and 224 days of conduct credit, torres was entitled to 773 total days of credit. (see  4019, subd. (f); people v. whitaker (2015) 238 cal.app.4th 1354, 1358.) torres contends he is also entitled to 22 days of credit for an arrest on september 12, 2013 and 17 days for flash incarcerations beginning on june 12, 2014 and september 9, 2014.3 the record does not disclose whether or how long torres remained in custody after his september 12, 2013 arrest. and not apply, and no credits may be eared, for periods of flash includes both of the flash incarcerations torres referenced in his calculations. torres is, therefore, not entitled to the additional credits he claims. we will order the trial court to correct the abstract of judgment in the 809 case to reflect that torres was entitled to 773 credits. iii. unauthorized sentence torres pled guilty to six counts of identifying information theft with a prior under section 530.5, subdivision (c)(2). the trial court sentenced torres to six eight-month terms in state prison for those violations. 3 as used in this context, fldetention in a city or cconditions of postrelease supervision. the length of the detention subd. (c).) 7 who, with the intent to defraud, acquires or retains possession of the personal identifying information, as defined in subdivision (b) of section 530.55, of another person, and who has previously been convicted of a violation of this section, upon conviction therefor shall be punished by a fine, by imprisonment in a county jail not to exceed one year, or by both a fine and imprisonment, or by imprisonment pursuant to subdivision (h) of section 1170.certain exceptions that do not apply here, section 1170, subdivision (h) also provides for imprisonment in county jail. we therefore requested briefing regarding whether a state prison commitment on these counts was an authorized sentence. after we requested briefing, one of the parties requested court of appeal. both parties have now pointed out that after the notice of appeal was filed and the record on appeal was settled, the department of corrections and rehabilitation contacted the trial court and requested that it correct its orders to reflect that torres should be committed to county jail. on may 3, 2017, the trial court filed an amended commitment order superseding its december 23, 2016 order and noting that torres was to serve all of his sentence in county jail. (people v. dunley (2016) 247 cal.app.4th 1438, 1445.) the trial rendered this question moot. 8 disposition directed to: (1) correct the abstract of judgment in no. ma060809 to reflect a total of 773 credits (324 days of back time, 225 days of custody credits, and 224 days of conduct credits); (2) correct the abstract of judgment in no. ma061092 to omit any sentencing credits; and (3) forward certified copies of the corrected abstracts not to be published. chaney, acting p. j. we concur: johnson, j. bendix, j.
