(faretta v. california (1975) 422 u.s. 806 [95 motion will be made on the grounds that advisory counse[l] can help guide [sic] through the legal due process of trial and will be able to expedite the pretrial process by helping procedure to challenge evidence presented at trial. advisory has limited time at law library and cannot properly prepare all motions afforded him in 5 [a] timely fashion [sicneeds advise [sic at a pretrial conference on may 27, 2010, judge rand s. rubin denied 2 at the conclusion of a pitchess3 hearing on june 18, 2010, the court announced it would arrange for standby counsel to be present for defendant at the next court date. on motions to suppress evidence and to set aside the information. defendant then had a discussion with the court as to how he was to be provided certain discovery he had requested from the people while he was in jail. to appoint advisory counsel to pick up the discovery from the people. when i was cross-examining my own self or direct examining my own self, for confusion of that nature, and for some kind of a a a guidance on the issues of out of how to build later, during an ex parte hearing, defendant renewed his request for advisory 2 request for co-appointed. 3 pitchess v. superior court (1974) 11 cal.3d 531. 6 attorney. ney, but i believe that you still have the discretion. you have the discretion of determining if i should have an advisory counsel. jury trial commenced on november 10, 2010, and standby counsel was present for defendant throughout the trial. 2. application of relevant legal principles california courts have discretion to appoint advisory counsel to assist an indigent defendant who elects to represent himself. (people v. crandell (1988) 46 cal.3d 833, 861, disapproved on other grounds by people v. crayton (2002) 28 cal.4th 346, 364--rms 4 (people v. bradford 4 established or definebrookner v. superior court (1998) 64 cal.app.4th 1390, 1395.) situations in which an accused and counsel are involved in the defense, such as (people v. hamilton (1989) 48 cal.3d 1142, 1164, fn. 14; see also brookner, supra, at p. 1393.) some courts have attempted to define these terms, but there is no uniformity in their ustrial, but only gives legal advice to the defendant (chaleff v. superior court (1977) 69 cal.app.3d 721, 731, fn. 6 (conc. opn. of hanson, j.); accord, people v. blair (2005) 36 cal.4th 686, 725); evidence but does not give legal advice. standby counsel is appointed for the benefit of the court to step in and represent the defendant in the event it becomes necessary to chaleff v. superior court, supra, at p. 731, fn. 7; blair, supra, at p. 725 7 (1997) 15 cal.4th 1229, 1368; accord, mckaskle v. wiggins (1984) 465 u.s. 168, 183 [104 s.ct. 944, 79 l.ed.2d 122]; people v. garcia (2000) 78 cal.app.4th 1422, 1430.) intelligence and verbal skills (people v. clark (1992) 3 cal.4th 41, 111), demonstrated legal abilities and reasons for seeking advisory counsel, and whether the motion represented an effort to manipulate the legal proceedings. (crandell, supra, at p. 863.) reasonable or even fairly debatable justification, under the law, for the action taken, such id. at p. 863.) defendant argues the record shows the lower court failed to exercise its discretion on his motion for advisory counsel. the failure to exercise discretion in refusing to grant a request for advisory counsel is error. (people v. crandell, supra, 46 cal.3d at p. 864 [after a summary denial].) if there is any absence of an exercise of discretion, we determine whether the denial of a request for advisory counsel would have been an abuse of discretion. (id. at pp. 862-863.) if the denial would not have been an abuse of discretion, no constitutional right is implicated, and we reunder people v. watson (1956) 46 cal.2d 818, 836. (crandall, supra, at pp. 864-865.) in this case, it appears the court failed to exercise its discretion in denying motions were summarily denied; there is no evidence the court evaluated the facts that may have justified the appointment of advisory counsel. (see people v. crandell, supra, 46 cal.3d at p. 862.) rather, it appears the court had a blanket rule that a defendant discretion was error. nonetheless, the record supports the inference that had the court exercised its equest for advisory counsel, such exercise would not the defendant and counsel share representation in some respect (people v. moore (2011) 51 cal.4th 1104, 1119, 1120, fn. 7). 8 have been an abuse of discretion. (people v. clark, supra, 3 cal.4th at p. 112.) in representing himself, defendant consistently demonstrated that he was a thorough and able advocate: he filed numerous pretrial motions, which he drafted and argued with considerable skill, including motions for informal discovery, pitchess and brady5 material, to suppress evidence, to set aside the information, to compel discovery, for sanctions for failure to comply with discovery, and for appointment of an eyewitness identification expert. at trial, defendant made motions in limine, engaged in jury voir dire; he cross-testimony) supporting his defense and surrebuttal; requested jury instructions and raised closing statements. (see people v. crandall, supra, 46 cal.3d at p. 865.) additionally, this case did not present highly complex legal issues, but instead turned on factual -prepared defense. (see clark, supra, at p. 111.) finally, the evidence in support of the verdicts was overwhelming. on this record, it is not reasonably probable that had advisory counsel been appointed, defendant would have obtained a more favorable result. (people v. watson, supra, 46 cal.2d at p. 826.) b. miscalculation of custody credits the trial court awarded defendant 446 days credit for time actually served in presentence custody, but only 49 days of presentence conduct credit. as defendant argues, he is entitled to 17 additional days of conduct credit15 percent of his actual custody timepursuant to section 2933.1, subdivision (c) (presentence conduct credit limited to 15 percent of actual custody days for defendant by reason of a firearm enhancement under  667.5, subd. (c)). (see generally people v. florez (2005) 132 cal.app.4th 314, 322.) 5 brady v. maryland (1963) 373 u.s. 83 [83 s.ct. 1194, 10 l.ed.2d 215]. 9 the people concede the miscalculation but argue it can only be raised in the trial court. ( conviction on the ground of an error in the calculation of presentence custody credits, unless the defendant first presents the claim in the trial court . . . contention that there was a miscalculation of presentence credits. in other words, section 1237.1 does not require a motion be filed in the trial court as a precondition to litigating (people v. acosta (1996) 48 cal.app.4th 411, 420; see also people v. florez, supra, 132 cal.app.4th at p. 318, fn. 12; people v. jones (2000) 82 cal.app.4th 485, 493; people v. duran (1998) 67 cal.app.4th 267, 269-270.) such is the situation in this case. accordingly, the judgment must be modified to reflect the additional 17 days of presentence conduct credits. disposition the judgment is modified to reflect a total of 512 days of presentence custody credits. as modified, the judgment is affirmed. the superior court is directed to prepare a corrected abstract of judgment and to forward it to the department of corrections and rehabilitation. jackson, j. we concur: perluss, p. j. zelon, j.
