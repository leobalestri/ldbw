(people v. castro-vasquez (2007) 148 cal.app.4th 1240, 1244 (castro-vasquez).) section 1016.5 requires that a trial court, before accepting a plea to a criminal verse immigration consequencesexclusion from admission, or denial of naturalization. ( 1016.5, subd. (a).) a trial that defective plea. ( 1016.5, subd.
