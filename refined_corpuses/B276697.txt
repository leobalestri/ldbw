(people v. romanowski (2017) 2 cal.5th 903, 917.) procedural background a traffic stop for expired registration tags led to the december 8, 2003 filing of a one-count felony complaint charging defendant with a violation of vehicle code section 10851, subdivision (a).1 the pleading alleged defendant drive and take a certain vehicle, to wit, a 1982 datsun . . . 1 vehicle code section 10851, subdivision (a) prperson who drives or takes a vehicle not his or her own, without the consent of the owner thereof, and with intent either to permanently or temporarily deprive the owner thereof of his or her title to or possession of the vehicle, whether with or without intent to steal the vehicle, or any person who is a party or an accessory to or an accomplice in the driving or unauthorized taking or stealing, is guilty of a public offense and, upon conviction thereof, shall be punished by imprisonment in a county jail for not more than one year or pursuant to subdivision (h) of section 1170 of the penal code or by a fine of not more than five thousand dollars ($5,000), or by both the fine and 3 without the consent of and with intent, either permanently or temporarily, to deprive the [ ] owner of title to and possession of (italics added.) the court acceguilty plea the following day. item 18 in the plea form, where was left blank. minute order recited, ) vc fel take veh on three years probation. she failed probation within a few months and, on february 18, 2004, the trial judge sentenced her to the low term of 16 months. the february 18, 2004 abstract of judgment indicated defendant was convicted of violating vehicle code section 10851, subdivision (a) and described the crime as rned to the same trial judge with an application to designate the felony conviction as a misdemeanor pursuant to penal code section 1170.18, subdivision (f). the court acknowledged that courts of appeal disagree on the issue, but noted was a joyride and proposition 47 does not apply to joyriding. d in briefs to this court, both parties cite to the probation report, which is included in the appellate record. the report explains defendant was driving the car several weeks after the owner reported it stolen. when arrested, she claimed she purchased the car that very day for $300. although she did not have a receipt for the purchase, she had a shaved key in her pocket. red to have been tampered with. 4 discussion vehicle code section 10851 is not one of the statutes listed in either penal code section 490.2 or penal code section 1170.18. whether proposition 47 nonetheless entitles a felony conviction under vehicle code section 10851 to be reduced to a misde- meanor if the value of the vehicle is less than $950 has been the subject of debate and disagreement among courts of appeal. the supreme court has granted review in these cases2 and on its website generally describes the issue does proposition 47 (the safe neighborhoods and schools act) apply to the offense of unlawful taking or driving a vehicle (veh. code,  10851), because it is a lesser included offense of penal code section 487, subdivision (d), and that offense is eligible for resentencing to a misdemeanor under penal code sections 490.2 and 1170.18? 2 people v. page (2015) 241 cal.app.4th 714, review granted january 27, 2016, s230793 (veh. code,  10851 ineligible for resentencing under  1170.18, subd.

(people v. jaramillo (1976) 16 cal.3d 752 (jaramillo).) in jaramillo, the defendant was convicted of violating both vehicle code section 10851, subdivision (a) and the penal code section 496, subdivision 1 (the statute then in effect for receiving stolen property) and acquitted of grand theft-auto (pen. code,  496, subd. (c).) the dual convictions were reversed: accused can be convicted of both violations only if his conviction of the vehicle code section is predicated on (jaramillo, supra, 16 cal.3d at p. 754.) the supreme court then explained that if the record does not disclose or suggest what specific findings were made in convicting a defendant of a violation of vehicle code section 10851 but it nevertheless appears that the fact finder may have found that the defendant intended to steal the vehicle, a second conviction based on a further finding that the defendant received that same stolen property is foreclosed.id. at p. 759.) this statement is footnoted, and there the supreme court observed that while the that it did not find that defendant took the automobile with intent to permanently deprive the [owners] of title or possession, 6 it is by no means conclusive of such a finding. (id. at p. 759, fn. 7.) the fact situation in people v. garza (2005) 35 cal.4th 866 (garza) was similar. in garza, however, the convictions for violating both vehicle code section 10851, subdivision (a) and penal code section 496, subdivision (a) were affirmed, even though the trial court failed to instruct sua sponte that the defendant could not be convicted of both stealing the vehicle and receiving stolen property. the supreme court recognized some violations of vehicle code section 10851 constitute theft and explained the analysis tudefendants section 10851(a) conviction was for the taking of the vehicle with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of possession, and thus a theft conviction, or merely for posttheft driving of the vehicle, and thus a nontheft conv (id. at p. uphold both convictions by construing defendants conviction under section 10851(a) as a nontheft conviction for posttheft id. at p. 882, fn. omitted.) the attorney general agrees, asserting, section 10851 can be violated in two ways: taking a vehicle with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of possession; or driving the vehicle with the intent to temporarily deprive the owner of possession. . . . the former, but not the latter, amounts although the felony complaint alleged in the alternative that defendant had the intent only to temporarily deprive the owner of possession, the record of the guilty plea and the disposition did not so finely parse the allegations. other than the alternative allegation in the felony complaint, nothing in the 7 post-theft driving of the vehicle rather than the theft similarly, nothing in the record unequivocally supports the finding that her conviction was based on theft. without specific findings, jaramillo, supra, 16 cal.3d 752, controls, and the matter must be remanded to permit defendant, if she so chooses, to offer a factual basis to support her guilty plea to a theft conviction. the attorney general recognizes theft provides a basis for violation of vehicle code section 10851, but argues it makes no sense to apply penal code section 490.2: would require that the defendant with the more culpable mental state (the intent to permanently deprive the owner of possession) be convicted of only a misdemeanor, while the defendant with the less culpable mental state (to temporarily deprive the owner of possession) could be cthis is akin to an equal protection argument; and people v. wilkinson (2004) 33 cal.4th 821, upon which the attorney general relies in his brief, provides the recriminal statutes prescribing different levels of punishments, nor the exercise of a prosecutor's discretion in charging under one such statute and not the other, violates equal protection id. at p. 838.) moreover, a finding of theft in this case would align with the analysis in people v. romanowski, supra, 2 cal.5th 903, we know that the voters who approved proposition 47 had their sights on definitions of grand theft other than the categories in [penal code] section 487, or any other provision 8 of law defining grand theft.people v. romanowski, supra, 2 cal.5th at p. 908, italics in original.) vehicle code section 10851 is under certain circumstances defines a theft offense. disposition the order is reversed and remanded with directions to permit defendant to admit her intent to permanently deprive the owner of the vehicle of its possession and present evidence that the value was less than $950. not to be published in the official reports dunning, j. we concur: kriegler, acting p. j. baker, j. judge of the superior court of the county of orange, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
