(see also people v. sanchez (2016) 63 cal.4th 665, 680.) if these conditions are met, this exception allows for the use of (evid. code,  1291, subd. (a)(2); people v. herrera (2010) 49 cal.4th 613, 621 (herrera).) in this appeal, defendant makes two arguments: (1) the seijas, supra, 36 cal.4th 291 and its progenyall of which consistently hold that an absent -examine are are wrongly decided. we need not consider the merits reconsider the decisions of our supreme court. (auto equity sales, inc. v. superior court (1962) 57 cal.2d 450, 455.) as to the first issue, wsubstantial evidence, and its determination of reasonable diligence de novo.

(a)(5); cromer, supra, 24 cal.4th at p. 898 [using this definition for confrontation clause purposes].) the prosecution bears the burden of establishing reasonable diligence. (herrera, supra, 49 cal.4th at p. 623.) reasonable diligence is a flexible standard aimed at people v. bunyard (2009) 45 cal.4th 836, 856; cromer, suprapersevering application, untiring efforts in good earnest, efforts of the people v. cummings (1993) 4 cal.4th 1233, 1298 (cummings)not prescient perfectionpeople v. diaz (2002) 95 cal.app.4th 695, 706). in have looked to (1) whether the search was timely begun(3) cromer, at p. 904.) what matters is the reasonableness of what the people did, not whether additional efforts or other lines of inquiry would have been more fruitful. (people v. wilson (2005) 36 cal.4th 309, 342 (wilson).) that the prosecution exercised reasonable diligence in attempting timely: she served v.s. with a trial subpoena nearly five weeks before trial and, although not legally required to do so (people v. fuiava (2012) 53 cal.4th 622, 675-676), kept tabs on v.s. in the intervening weeks leading up to trial. as late as june 1, the 12 and once v.s. voiced the intent not to appear on the morning of her anticipated testimony, the detective immediately began trying to persuade her to come to court and to physically locate precise sex acts defendant committed against her and their order. but the presence of defendaround mouth independentlywithout any explanation of how his dna got there, forcefullyalso introduced evidence of injuries her genitals, chest, and right breast consistent with being poked with a knife and forcibly penetrated, respectively. and once the chased down every lead she had: she called v.s., texted her, and went to her last known address; when these turned up no further leads, current location, went to the two possible apartment complexes to search for v.s. she also encouraged v.s. to meet with her through messages that conveyed understanding as well as the (cummings, supra, 4 cal.4th at p. 1298; accord, people v. valencia (2008) 43 cal.4th 268, 292-293 [reasonable diligence where investigator attempted to reach the witness by phone, visited his home once, checked dmv records and visited two other apartments listed in those records, and spoke with neighbors but received no leads].) 13 defendant offers three categories of reasons why, in his view, the trial court erred in finding that v.s. was unavailable to testify. first, he argues that v.s. never said she would never factually and legally without merit. factually, defendant ignores evince a more definitive refusal to testify. legally, all that is required is a refusal to testify at the time that testimony is needed, not permanent unavailability. (people v. gomez (1972) 26 unavailability is permanent would be, except in case of death, to locate v.s. on the morning of june 2 were inadequate because (1) she never asked v.s. why she was unavailable (which defendant states could have been attributable to work obligations, transportation issues, or child care issues) and thus never tried to remedy that reason, and (2) she reminded v.s. of the gravity of her noncompliance with the subpoena. these assertions misunderstand the nature of the reasonable efforts inquiry, which looks to the reasonableness of what the prosecution did and not whether additional efforts or other lines of inquiry would have been more fruitful. (wilson, supra, 36 cal.4th at p. 342.) even if we were to ignore the applicable legal standar 14 detective was not lax for failing to ask v.s. why she did not want to come to court because v.s. had already explained that she was not coming becwere really a smokescreen for car trouble or other reasons is purely speculative. nor was the detective lax for pointing out the informed v.s. what would happen if she did not come to court. indeed, if the detective had not explained these consequences, she would no doubt be faulted for not doing so. lastly, defendant contends that the trial court erred in declaring v.s. to be unavailable without first (1) issuing a body attachment for v.s. and having the detective inform v.s. of this ), or (3) continuing contentions lacks merit. the trial court did issue a body attachment for v.s., and the detective had already told v.s. that the ordering the detective to arrest v.s. was not an option because (1) the detective had already tried to locate v.s. and had failed, (2) there was no reason to believe v.s. was at work because she had requested june 2 as the day to testify because it was her day willing to provide about law prohibits the incarceration of the victim of a sex crime as a means of inducing the victim to testify (code civ. proc.,  1219, 15 contempt in refupeople v. cogswell (2010) 48 cal.4th 467, 477-479). and the trial court did not err in declining to continue the trial or take matters out of order because defendant never asked for such a continuance (people v. alcala (1992) 4 cal.4th obligation to volunteer, sua sponte, that the defense could have (people v. winbush (2017) 2 cal.5th 402, 469-470 [denial of disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. ______________________, j. hoffstadt we concur: _________________________, p. j. lui _________________________, j. chavez
