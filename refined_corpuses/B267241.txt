(a) & 664), (2) attempted criminal threats ( 422, subd. (a) & 664), (3) assault with a firearm ( 245, subd. (a)(2)), and (4) assault with a semiautomatic firearm ( 245, subd. (b)). for each crime, the people further alleged that defendant personally used a firearm ( 12022.53, subd. (b) [for the attempted murder] &  12022.5, subd. (a) [for the remaining crimes]). a jury convicted defendant of all four crimes, and found true the allegation that the attempted murder was committed willfully, deliberately and with premeditation and the firearm use allegations. the trial court sentenced defendant to prison for life plus 13 years. the court imposed a prison sentence of three years for the assault with a semiautomatic firearm count and struck the firearm use allegation. the court then imposed a consecutive prison sentence of life plus 10 years for the attempted murder count, comprised of life for the attempted murder itself plus an additional 10 years for the firearm use enhancement. the court imposed a concurrent, one-year sentence for attempted criminal threats count, but struck the firearm use allegation for that count. because the people freely admitted that the assault with a firearm count was based on the same conduct as the assault with a semiautomatic firearm count, the court stayed the six month sentence for the assault with a firearm count.2 defendant filed this timely appeal. 2 the court simultaneously imposed a concurrent, three-year sentence for subd. (a)) in a separate case. 4 discussion defendant argues that his sentence is legally invalid because (1) the trial court should have stayed the three-year assault with a semiautomatic firearm sentence under section 654, personally used a firearm in conjunction with the attempted criminal threats count. when it imposed sentence, struck the personal firearm use enhancement for the attempted criminal threats count. as a result, we cannot grant defendant any effective relief because the trial court already did. (accord, la mirada avenue neighborhood assn. of hollywood v. city of los angeles (2016) 2 cal.app.5th 586, 590 [an issue is moot on r the appellate court to grant [the] appellant any effective ple convictions. ( 654, subd. (a).) section 654 also applies when the defendant engages in multiple acts that are part of a single course of conduct. (people v. capistrano (2014) 59 cal.4th 830, 885-886 (capistrano).) when examining whether to stay sentences for crimes occurring in a single course of conduct, courts have employed two tests. in the vast majority of cases, the l of the offenses were incident to one objective, the (capistrano, supra, 59 cal.4th at p. 885, quoting people v. rodriguez (2009) 47 cal.4th 501, 507.) however, if the defendant while committing the various acts simultaneously has indepban does not apply and he may be separately punished for each offense. (people v. blake (1998) 68 cal.app.4th 509, 512; people v. rodriguez (2015) 235 cal.app.4th 1000, 1007 (rodriguez).) however, in certain types of cases where a defendant repeatedly commits discrete acts with a single objective or intentsuch as committing multiple sexual 5 assaults or firing a gun multiple times from a carmultiple punishments turns on whether the people v. trotter (1992) 7 cal.app.4th 363, 367-368; see also people v. harrison (1989) 48 cal.3d 321, 337-338; people v. braz (1997) 57 cal.app.4th 1, 11; people v. surdi (1995) 35 cal.app.4th 685, 689.) because the trial court did not make any express findings on how section 654 applies to the offenses defendant challenges on appeal, we reviefinding that section 654 does not apply for substantial evidence. (rodriguez, supra, 235 cal.app.4th at p. 1005; people v. brents (2012) 53 cal.4th 599, 618.) to determine what conduct of the defendant the jury used to convict the defendant of each charged offense, we look to how the prosecutor argued the case to the jury. (people v. kelly (2016) 245 cal.app.4th 1119, 1131; people v. ortega (2000) 84 cal.app.4th 659, 665-666.) here, the prosecutor told the jury that the attempted murder t roa and pulling the trigger, ,he gun and pointed it at [roa]. pointing the gun at roa and pulling the trigger, the very same conduct underlies both the assault and attempted murder counts. section 654 would clearly apply. pistol whipping roa, we must apply the two tests described above, which require us to ask (1) whether defendant had the same intent and objective when he tried to shoot roa with the gun as he did when he tried to beat roa with the gun, and (2) whether defendant had time to reflect between the two incidents. at roa with the gun and beat roa with the gun was the samethat is, to harm and, if possible, kill roa. indeed, defendant tried to pull the trigger a third time during the melee. on these facts, there is no distinction between the intent to kill and the intent to injure. (people v. womack (1[t]here is no repugnancy 6 between an intent to kill the victim and an intent to injure himpeople v. meriweather (1968) 263 cal.app.2d 559, 563-564 [section 654 applies when a defendant is guilty of attempted murder and assault with intent to commit murder]; people v. kynette (1940) 15 cal.2d 731, 760-761 [same].) whipping roa came just seconds after defendant twice pulled the trigger, and was melee was continuous and uninterrupted, and provided defendant no time to reflect. the people resist this conclusion, arguing that defendant pistol whipped roa only argue, defendant pistol whipped roa with the distinct intent to incapacitate him and thereby extricate himself from the melee he started. this argument fails both factually and legally. it is factually unsupported because roa did nothing to thwart the shooting; the gun just misfired. also, roa did not pin defendant to the wall until after defendant pistol whipped him. because defendant pistol whipped roa at a time when defendant still had the upper hand in the fight, there is no substantial evidence to support a finding that he was trying to extricate himself fris also legally untenable because it is akin to an argument that defendant was acting with the intent to defend himself. but that option is legally unavailable to a person who started a fight unless, at a minimum, that person tries to withdraw from the fight. (people v. crandell (1988) 46 cal.3d 833, 871-872.) the jury specifically rejected the defense of self-defense at trial, and necessarily found that defendant did not act with such an intent. 7 disposition the convictions are affirmed. the sentence on count 3 is stayed pursuant to section 654. the superior court is directed to forward a certified copy of the corrected abstract of judgment to the department of corrections and rehabilitation. as modified, the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. _______________________, j. hoffstadt we concur: _______________________, acting p. j. ashmann-gerst _______________________, j. chavez
