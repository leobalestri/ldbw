(a))1 and identity theft ( 530.5, subd. (c)(1)). the same day, pursuant to a negotiated agreement, the trial court imposed a split sentence for forgery of two years in county jail and one year of mandatory supervision on condition that welch comply with a protective order pursuant to section 136.2.2 in accordance with the agreement, the remaining felony counts were dismissed. the court awarded welch 64 days of presentence custody credit and imposed mandatory fines, fees and assessments. during the plea hearing, the court confirmed with welch and his counsel that his felony conviction for forgery did not qualify under proposition 47 for reduction to a misdemeanor. welch replied that he understood. following sentencing, welch, still represented by counsel, filed several motions on his own, which the court considered over the course of several hearings. the court (people v marsden (1970) 2 cal.3d 118) and to modify his sentence by striking the one-year of mandatory supervision. faretta v. california (1975) 422 u.s. 806, 835-836 [45 l.ed.2d 562, 95 s.ct. 2525]) and relieved the public defender as counsel of record. his felony conviction to a misdemeanor under proposition 47. welch asked the court not to rule on his motion to withdraw his plea. during the final hearing on april 24, 2015, the trial court realized that it had not imposed a sentence for identity theft and that the pertinent minute order and abstract of judgment erroneously reflected a sentence of three years for that misdemeanor count. 1 statutory references are to the penal code. 2 the protective order stemmed from an unrelated domestic violence case, which the people agreed to have dismissed as part of the negotiated plea. 3 the court sentenced welch for identity theft, nunc pro tunc, to credit for time served. the court also denied as untimely other oral and written post-sentencing motions, seeking to recuse judge fisher and to vacate the sentence and a continuance to hire a private investigator, retain private counsel, obtain discovery and be treated for mental illness. superior court,which was directed to the appellate division of the superior court and the second district court of appeal. in his notice of appeal, welch challenges the trial denials of his post sentencing oral and written motions on various grounds. welch did not obtain a certificate of probable cause. we appointed counsel to represent on appeal. after examination of the record, counsel filed an opening brief in which no issues were raised. on september 14, 2015 we advised welch he had 30 days within which to submit any contentions or issues he wished us to consider. we have received no response. a criminal defendant who appeals following a plea of no contest or guilty without a certificate of probable cause can only challenge the denial of a motion to suppress evidence or raise grounds arising after the entry of the plea that do not affect the pleas validity. (cal. rules of court, rule 8.304(b)(1).) to the extent welch is challenging the validity of his plea and his sentence imposed as part of his plea, his appeal is inoperative. to the extent welch f his request to have his forgery conviction reduced to a misdemeanor, proposition 47, as it potentially relates to welch, added section 473, subdivision (b), to the penal code. pursuant to section 473, subdivision (a), forgery is punishable as either a felony or misdemeanor (a so-called $950, is only a misdemeanor, punishable by imprisonment in a county jail for not more than one year. however, person, who is convicted both of forgery and of identity theft, as defined in section  473, subd. (b).) accordingly, because welch was convicted of violating both 4 section  484f, subdivision (a) and section 530.5, subdivision (c)(1), his forgery offense cannot be reduced to a misdemeanor under proposition 47. the trial court properly denied his petition. we have examined the entire record and are satisfied s appellate attorney has fully complied with the responsibilities of counsel and no arguable issue exists.
