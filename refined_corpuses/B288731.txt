(holmes, at p. 436.) a court may establish a factual basis for a plea in a number of ways: (1) the defendant can personally describe his conduct in his own words (holmes, at p. 436); (2) the defendant can tell the court that he discussed the elements of the crime with his counsel people v. palmer (2013) 58 cal.4th 110, 118); or (3) defense counsel can stipulate that a factual basis exists as long as the stipulation refers to a 4 (people v. french (2008) 43 cal.4th 36, 50-51). however, a bare stipulation by counsel that a factual basis exists is insufficient if it does not reference a document setting forth the defendaconduct. (people v. willard (2007) 154 cal.app.4th 1329, 1334-1335.) the above described judicial duty to assure that a plea has that is, pleas hoffard, supra, 10 cal.4th at pp. 1181, 1184; people v. marlin (2004) 124 cal.app.4th 559, 571.) the duty is limited to conditional pleas unlike unnegotiated, so-called [a] defendant will hoffard, at p. 1182; people v. watts (1977) 67 cal.app.3d 173, 178.) defendant argues that his plea is invalid because (1) his plea was conditional, and (2) the trial court found a factual basis to a factual basis that did not incorporate any document describing for a plea for an abuse of discretion. (holmes, supra, 32 cal.4th at p. 443.) the trial court did not abuse its discretion in accepting s plea because defendant has not established the first premise of his argumentnamely, that his plea was conditional. as noted above, snot apply when a defendant enters an open plea by people v. cuevas (2008) 44 cal.4th 374, 381, fn. 4; hoffard, supra 5 that is, if the court tells the defendant what sentence the court would impose whether or not the defendant goes to trial and the defendant enters a plea to all charges and admits all allegationsbecause such an indicated sentence is not conditioned upon the entry of the people v. clancey (2013) 56 cal.4th 562, 575-576 (clancey).) here, the minute order excolloquy is consistent with the court accepting an open plea after sharing with the defendant and his counsel, in an off-the-record conversatid defendant responds that his plea was conditional, and that objection is inaccurate. for support of his position, defendant cites (1) s indication that defendant would be receiving a three year sentence if he entered a plea, (2) the stipulate to a factual basis (which would have been unnecessary if the plea were truly an ), and (3) the absence of an on-the-record objection by the prosecutor. it defendants who entered pleas during the same colloquy. because the transcripts control over written orders in criminal cases (people v. mesa (1975) 14 cal.3d 466, 471), defendant concludes, we must reject the erroneous minute order in favor of the plea transcript that implies his plea was conditional. pronouncements control over its minute orders only when there is 6 a conflict (mesa, supra, 14 cal.3d at p. 471), and here there is not. advisement that defendant would be sentenced to three years is consistent with the trial court sharing an indicated sentence is, as noted above, an unconditional plea. to the extent defendant invites us to infer that the trial court had promised defendant three years in exchange for his plea, we decline that invitation because it requires us to infer that the trial court violated binding supreme court precedent that precludes such judicial negotiation (clancey, supra, at 56 cal.4th at p. 575; people v. stowell court is presumed to have been aware of and followed the ause it ignores that defendant pled guilty to the sole charged count and admitted the strike allegation (which would be required for an open plea, but which would make no sense for a negotiated plea that contemplated the dismissal of the strike allegation). the basis also does not indicate that the plea was conditional; the requiring more than was necessary does not alter the underlying (or, fodoes not cut either way because informal, off-the-record discussions regarding the disposition of a case are commonplace and permissible in criminal cases.
