(pen. code,  245, subd. (a)(1).)1 in a bifurcated proceeding, the trial court found willard had suffered two prior serious felony convictions and one prior juvenile adjudication for served separate prison terms for felonies. ( 667, subds. (a), (b)-(i), 1170.12, subds. (a)-(d); 667.5, subd. (b).) willard was sentenced to an aggregate state prison term of 30 years to life. on appeal, he contends insufficient evidence supports the true finding on his prior 1978 juvenile robbery adjudication. we affirm the judgment of conviction and remand for resentencing. factual and procedural background , the people introduced evidence of his two 1987 robbery convictions in los angeles superior court case no. a6354392 and his 1978 juvenile adjudication for robbery in case no. j250484. with respect to his juvenile adjudication, the admitted evidence showed willard was born on october 1, 1960, arrested for committing robbery ( 211) on february 22, 1978, adjudicated as having committed the offense on june 13, 1978, and confined at the california youth authority, as it was formerly known, from june 19, 1978 until october 15, 1981. to an aggregate term of 30 years to life. discussion willard contends, and the people acknowledge, the evidence is insufficient to support a finding that he was at least 16 years old at the time he committed robbery. 1 statutory references are to the penal code, unless otherwise indicated. 2 case numbers refer to los angeles superior court cases. 3 the three strikes law expressly permits a prior juvenile adjudication to constitute a committed the prior offense. [] (b) the prior offense is listed in subdivision (b) of section 707 of the welfare and institutions code or described in paragraph (1) or (2) as a felony. [] (c) the juvenile was found to be a fit and proper subject to be dealt with under the juvenile court law. [] (d) the juvenile was adjudged a ward of the juvenile court within the meaning of section 602 of the welfare and institutions code because the person committed an offense listed in subdivision (b) of section ( 667, subd. (d)(3)(a-people v. garcia (1999) 21 cal.4th 1, 12.) a prior conviction must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. (people v. henley conviction and that the conviction was of an offense within the definition of the particular statute invoked, and any other element required by the statute alleged. (ibid.) the trier of fact is entitled to draw reasonable inferences from certified records offered to prove the prior conviction. however, such inferences must be supported by substantial evidence. (id. at p. 651.) we agree the evidence is insufficient that willard was at least 16 years old at the time he committed the robbery which is the subject of his juvenile adjudication. the record establishes he was born on october 1, 1960, making him 17 years old when he was thereafter committed to the california youth authority (now the division of juvenile facilities) for robbery. the people did not produce a welfare and institutions code section 602 petition or other documen as permitted by people v. barragan (2004) 32 cal.4th 236, which held that for three strikes sentencing purposes, an alleged prior juvenile adjudication may be retried. 4 whether or not the people elect to retry the juvenile adjudication, we note that wilmay choose, on remand, to exercise its discretion to strike one of those qualifying prior strike convictions in resentencing willard. (people v. benson (1998) 18 cal.4th 24, 36 fn. 8. need not and do not determine whether there are some circumstances in which two prior felony convictions are so closely connected--for example, when multiple convictions arise out of a single act by the defendant as distinguished from multiple acts committed in an indivisible course of conduct--that a trial court would abuse its discretion under section 1385 disposition the judgment of conviction is affirmed, and the cause is remanded for resentencing in accordance with this opinion. woods, acting p. j. we concur: zelon, j. jackson, j.
