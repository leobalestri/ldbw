(people v. arredondo (2018) 21 cal.app.5th 493, 506.) however, senate bill no. 620 (sb 620) amended the statute, effective january 1, 2018, to give trial courts the discretion, in limited circumstances, pursuant to section 1385, to strike a firearm enhancement in the interests of justice. (sen. bill no. 620 (2017-2018 reg. sess.) stats. 2017, ch. 682; people v. billingsley (2018) 22 cal.app.5th 1076, 1079-1080 & fn. 7.) in september 2018, defendant filed a motion asking the court to exercise this newfound discretion to strike his firearm enhancements. defendant now appeals from the denial of his request to strike. we appointed counsel to represent him on this appeal. counsel filed an opening brief pursuant to people v. wende (1979) 25 cal.3d 436, and requested this court to independently review the record on appeal to determine whether any arguable issues exist. on may 1, 2019, we advised defendant that he had 30 days within which to personally submit any contentions or issues he wished us to consider. we received no response.
