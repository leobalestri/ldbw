(b)).2 the people further alleged that defendant counts ( 12022.5). a jury convicted defendant of all of the above described charges and found the firearm enhancement to be true. the trial court sentenced defendant to prison for 12 years and four months. the court imposed a nine-year prison sentence for assaulting kelly with a firearm (count 1), calculated as a base sentence of six years plus a low-end term of three years for the firearm enhancement. the court then imposed a consecutive 40-month prison sentence (count 2), calculated as a base sentence of two years (that is, one third of the middle term of six years) plus 16 months for the firearm enhancement (that is, one third of the middle term of four years). the court imposed concurrent 10-year prison sentences on the remaining assault with a firearm counts, concurrent (but stayed) six-year sentences on the criminal 1 all further statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise indicated. 2 the people also charged defendant with attempted criminal 422, subd. (a)) and with dissuading a witness by force or threat ( 136.1, subd. (c)(1)). however, the people dismissed the attempted criminal threats count after they rested their case-in-chief at trial, and the jury acquitted defendant of the dissuasion count. 6 threats counts, and a concurrent two-year sentence on the unlawful firearm activity count. defendant filed this timely appeal. discussion i. evidentiary issues defendant argues that the trial court erred in (1) admitting evidence pertaining to his possession of a gun in october 2016 and november 2016 because that evidence showed, at most, that which is an impermissible purpose under evidence code sections 1101 and 352 (see people v. riser (1956) 47 cal.2d 566, 577 (riser), overruled on other grounds, people v. morse (1964) 60 cal.2d 631); and (2) admitting evidence of his statement to the booking officer because it was not disclosed until midway through trial, in violation of the criminal discovery act ( 1054 et seq.). we review both claims for an abuse of discretion. (people v. clark (2016) 63 cal.4th 522, 586 [evidentiary rulings]; people v. mora and rangel (2018) 5 cal.5th 442, 466 (mora) [discovery rulings].) a. the october and november 2016 incidents evid. code,  1101, is generally defendant is the kind of person who surrounds himself with people v. archer (2000) 82 cal.app.4th 1380, 1392-1392; riser, supra, 47 cal.2d at p. 577; people v. henderson (1976) 58 cal.app.3d 349, 360; people v. barnwell (2007) 41 7 cal.4th 1038, 1056; see people v. riggins (1910) 159 cal. 113, 120-121.) however, this general rule of inadmissibility does not apply when the weapon the defendant at some other time possessed [s], might have been the weapon used in the charged crime(s) because the prior or subsequent possession of potentially the same weapon tends to weapon at issue during the charged crime(s).3 (people v. ferdinand (1924) 194 cal. 555, 563 (ferdinand); people v. radovich (1932) 122 cal.app. 176, 180-181 (radovich); people v. carpenter (1999) 21 cal.4th 1016, 1052.) for these purposes, [] required. (radovich, at p. 180; ferdinandclear, certain, people v. hale (1927) 81 required].) 3 the rule also does not apply when the weaponeven if certainly not the weapon used in the charged crime(s)is relevant for any other non-propensity purpose under evidence code section 1101, subdivision (b). (people v. cox (2003) 30 cal.4th 916, 956-957 [so noting], overruled in part on other grounds in people v. doolin (2009) 45 cal.4th 390, 421, fn. 22; see, e.g., people v. prince (2007) 40 cal.4th 1179, 1248-1249 could be used in armed robbery . . . in furtherance of the criminal people v. jablonski (2006) 37 cal.4th 774, 822 [defepeople v. farnam (2002) 28 cal.4th 107, 156- 8 applying these principles, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the evidence that defendant possessed a black, semi-automatic glock in october 2016 and in november 2016. that is because both kelly and his son testified that the gun they saw defendant wield during the charged july 2016 the guns defendant possessed in october and november 2016. what is more, the trial court so ruled only after conducting a hearing outside the presence of the jury to inquire whether kelly people had proffered). the trial court also gave the jury a limiting instructionat the time the evidence was introduced as well as at the conclusion of trialadmitting the evidence only proved that [] defendant possessed a firearm for all the charges [] defendant has a bad given the probative value of this evidence under the above stated precedent and the the danger of any unfair prejudice, the trial court also did not abuse its discretion in admitting this evidence under evidence code section 352. and because the admission of evidence complied with state evidentiary law, it did not violate any of the federal constitutional provisions defendant cites. (people v. lindberg (2008) 45 cal.4th 1, 26 [properly applying ordinary rules of evidence does not violate federal constitutional rights].) b. booking (the act), the 9 the prosecuting attorney violates the act (and if the defendant had previously made a written request for discovery), a court may consider a number of sanctions ra, to an instruction advising the jury , ( 1054.5, subds. (b) & (c).) preclusion of testimony is meant to be used only as a last resort, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to for two reasons. first, the act itself did not mandate the until the prosecutor learned of itws it to be in the possession of . . . thus, if the materials or information is neither in the nor is something she knows is possessed (people v. whalen (2013) 56 cal.4th 1, 65, fn. 27 (whalen); people v. verdugo (2010) 50 cal.4th 263, 288-289 [same].) here, not memorialized in to the prosecutor until the middle of trial (at which point the because the statement was neither in the possession of the prosecuting attorney nor something she knew about, she was not required to 10 disclose it any sooner than she did (namely, when she first learned about it mid-trial). second, defendant has not established a at least 30 days prior to trial. (mora, supra, 5 cal.5th at p. 467.) as a threshold matter, it is not reasonably probable that the court would have excluded the testimony given that exclusion is a remedy of last resort. ( 1054.5, subd. (c).) further, defendant himself could not articulate how he was prejudiced by the mid-perhaps it would be relevant to negotiation discussionserently he record belies the assertion that defendant would have been any more willing to accept a plea offer; he unequivocally rejected all prior plea offers from the people. and defendant was able toand didcross examine the booking officer as to why he did not include the statement in his report, thereby enabling him to suggest to the jury that the booking . defendant nevertheless urges that the statement should have been excluded for two further reasons. first, he argues that prosecutors are deemed to know what their investigating officers know, such that the prosecuting booking officer is irrelevant to whether there is a violation of the act. for support, defendant cites in re littlefield (1993) 5 cal.4th 122 (littlefield) and people v. little (1997) 59 cal.app.4th 426 (little). while prosecutors are deemed to know what all members prosecution teames of their due 11 process-based duty to disclose favorable, material evidence under brady v. maryland (1963) 373 u.s. 83 (people v. zambrano (2007) 41 cal.4th 1082, 1133, overruled in part on other grounds in people v. doolin (2009) 45 cal.4th 390, 421, fn. 22), the act does not impute such knowledge: as noted above, the act only t reach evidence neither possessed nor known by the prosecuting attorney (whalen, supra, 56 cal.4th at 65, fn. 27). littlefield and little are distinguishable: littlefield held that defense attorneys (and, by extension, prosecuting attorneys) are required by the act to readily availablechose not to learn (littlefield, at pp. 135-136), and little applied littlefield to impose a duty upon prosecuting attorneys to obtain rap sheets of witnesses because prosecutors have special access to those rap sheets (little, at pp. 432-433). apart from whether these cases remain good law after whalen, these cases do not apply where, as here, there is no evidence that the prosecutor was willfully choosing not to learn information or had special access to the information. indeed, the only way to agree with would be to require prosecuting attorneys to interview every participating investigating officer about every detail in report in the hopes that they might reveal additional unreported information. but this would all but eviscerate the general rule from which littlefield acknowledged it was fashioning a narrow exceptionnamely, the [ve] no general duty to seek out, obtain, and disclose all evidence that might be beneficial to the littlefield, at p. 135.) 12 second, defendant argues that admitting the booking esmanship [that] is inconsistent with the quest for roland v. superior court (2004) 124 cal.app.4th 154, 165, quoting littlefield, supra, 5 cal.4th at p. 133). however, there is no evidence of gamesmanship here. the booking officer testified, without contradiction, that he was a brand new officer who statement in his report. ii. sentencing issue defendant argues, and the people concede, that he is entitled to a remand for the trial court to consider whether to strike the firearm enhancements imposed in this case. among other things, senate bill 620 amended section 12022.5 to grant trial courts the discretion to strike enhancements for the personal use of a firearm. ( 12022.5, subd. (c); sen. bill no. 620 (2017-2018 reg. sess.), stats. 2017, ch. 682,  1.) because this law grants a trial court the discretion to mitigate or reduce a criminal sentence, it applies retroactively to all nonfinal convictions unless our legislature has expressed a contrary intent. (people v. francis (1969) 71 cal.2d 66, 75-78; in re estrada (1965) 63 cal.2d 740, 744-745.) our legislature expressed no such intent with senate bill 620. accordingly, defendant is entitled to the benefit of the amendments to section 12022.5 and thus is entitled to a remand to allow the trial court to exercise its newfound -end sentence for the firearm enhancement and its decision to run several sentences concurrently, there is no clear indication in the record that the trial court would not have stricken this 13 enhancement at the time of sentencing had it been aware of its discretion to do so. (see people v. mcdaniels (2018) 22 cal.app.5th 420, 425.) 14 disposition the case is remanded for resentencing to allow the trial court to consider whether the enhancements under section 12022.5 should be stricken. in all other respects, conviction is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. ______________________, j. hoffstadt we concur: _________________________, acting p.j. ashmann-gerst _________________________, j. chavez
