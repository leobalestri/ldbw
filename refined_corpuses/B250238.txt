(people v. tully (2012) 54 cal.4th 952, 979hile we ultimately exercise our independent judgment to determine the constitutional propriety of a search or seizure, we do so within the context of historical facts determined by the trial court. (ibid.) we view the evidence in a light most favorable to the order denying the motion to suppress. (ibid.) 4 one of the specifically established exceptions to the fourth amendments warrant requirement is a search incident to a lawful arrest. (people v. diaz (2011) 51 cal.4th 84, 90, quoting united states v. robinson (1973) 414 u.s. 218, 224.) as noted in people v. nottoli (2011) 199 cal.app.4th 531, 546in chimel v. california (1969) 395 u.s. 752, 762763 [23 l.ed.2d 685, 89 s.ct. 2034] (chimel), the supreme court established that, incident to a lawful custodial arrest, the arresting officer could search the arrestee and the area within the arrestees immediate control. the two justifications for the authority to search were officer safety and preservation of evidence when a custodial arrest is made, there is always some danger that the person arrested may seek to use a weapon, or that evidence may be concealed or destroyed. to safeguard himself and others, and to prevent the loss of evidence, it has been held reasonable for the arresting officer to conduct a prompt, warrantless search of the within his immediate control . . .people v. diaz, supra, 51 cal.4th at p. 90, quoting united states v. chadwick (1977) 433 u.s. 1, 1415 people v. nottoli, supra, 199 cal.app.4th at p. 547, quoting chimel, supra, 395 u.s. at p. 763.) b. the search was justified based on officer safety and evidentiary concerns within the contours of the traditional search incidenat the time of fle bag was only two feet away from him, well within chimel, supra, 395 u.s. at p. 763.) both the bag and the whiskey box inside were large enough to hold a weapon and evidence of contraband. and the search was conducted within two minutes of the arrest, before appellant had been removed from the motel room. arizona v. gant (2009) 556 u.s. 332 (gant) and people v. leal (2009) 178 cal.app.4th 1051 (leal), as support for his position that the search of the 5 bag was no longer justified after he had been arrested, is unavailing. in gant, which ,gant, supra, at p. 343), the defendant was arrested for driving with a suspended license, handcuffed, and locked in a patrol car. (id. at p. 336.) officers then searched his parked car and found a gun and cocaine. (ibid.) the gant court held that the search of was unlawful because it did not meet the twin justifications for a search incident to arrestthe defendant could not have accessed his car to retrieve weapons or evidence and he did not commit an offense for which police could expect to find evidence. (id. at p. 335.) but the gant when it is reasonable to believe that evidence of the offense of arrest might be found in the vehicle.(ibid.) even if gant were applicable outside the vehicle context, both justifications for a search incident to arrest were present here. first, the duffle bag was within reaching gave officer galvez reason to believe the duffle bag contained a weapon or contraband worth defending. second, as officer galvez testified, the fact that appellant was subject to arrest on a narcotics-related felony warrant gave the officer further reason to believe the bag contained narcotics. in leal, officers arrested the defendant outside his house pursuant to an arrest warrant for two (undescribed) misdemeanors and placed him in a patrol car about 30 to 38 feet away from his place of arrest. (leal, supra, 178 cal.app.4th at p. 1058.) several officers searched the house and found no one else present. (ibidtwo or three minutes later, with the scene secure, officers safety assured, and defendant unable to reach or destroy any evidence in the house, a police officer searched the area near the front doorthe site of defendants arrestand found the handgun under a sweatshirt.id. at p. 1059.) the leal court found the search unlawful, stating, once an accused is under arrest and in custody, then a search made at another place, without a warrant, is simply not incident to the arrest. (id. at p. 1060, quoting chambers v. maroney (1970) 399 u.s. 42, 47 [26 l.ed.2d 419, 90 s. ct. 1975].) citing gant, the leal court also stated: 6 a different rule of reasonableness applies when the police have a degree of control over a suspect but do not have control of the entire situation. in such circumstancese.g., in which third parties known to be nearby are unaccounted for, or in which a suspect has not yet been fully secured and retains a degree of ability to overpower the police or destroy evidencethe fourth amendment does not bar the police from searching the immediate area of the suspects arrest as a search incident to an arrest.leal, supra, at p. 1060.) here, by contrast, appellant had not been removed from the site of his arrest and remained within reaching distance of the bag. officer galvez testified on cross-examination that while he was not especially concerned that appellant would reach into [sic] of weapons and shot actua properly denied the motion to suppress. c. alternative basis for affirmance at the suppression hearing, the prosecutor made the alternative argument that the supported a finding that he had no reasonable expectation of contents. the trial court agreed, and so do we. a search of abandoned property is not subject to fourth amendment protection. (people v. parson (2008) 44 cal.4th 332, 345.) it has long been settled, however, that a warrantless search and seizure involving abandoned property is not unlawful, because a person has no reasonable expectation of privacy in such property.ibid.) abandonment here is not meant in the strict property-right sense, but rests instead on whether the person so relinquished his interest in the property that he no longer retained a (id. at p. 346.) settled law that a disclaimer of proprietary or possessory interest in the area searched or the evidence discovered terminates the legitimate expectation of privacy over such area or items. (people v. dasilva (1989) 207 cal.app.3d 43, 48.) the question whether 7 ing must be upheld if supported by substantial evidence. (people v. parson, supra, at p. 346.) appellant, by his statements and actions, consistently denied ownership of the duffle bag. he told the arresting officers to take his ipad but not the duffle bag, because the duffle bag. and when he retrieved his belongings from the jail warehouse, he immediately threw out the duffle bag in a trash bin. accordingly, a any expectation of privacy in providing an alternative basis for affirmance. disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. __________________________, j. ashmann-gerst we concur: _____________________________, p. j. boren ____________________________, j. chavez
