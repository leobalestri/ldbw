(see people v. hall (2016) 247 cal.app.4th 1255, 1260.) proposition 47 also created a 1 all further statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise stated. 2 he was also charged with forgery ( 476) but that charge was dismissed. 3 new resentencing provision, section 1170.18, under which persons previously convicted of felonies that were reclassified as misdemeanors, who have completed their sentences, may petition to have their felony convictions redesignated as misdemeanors. ( 1170.18, subd. (f).) on june 15, 2015, roddy filed a section 1170.18 petition for resentencing, seeking to have his burglary conviction designated a misdemeanor pursuant to the newly-enacted section 459.5. section 459.5 redefined as misdemeanors certain burglaries that establishment with the intent to commit larceny while that establishment is open during regular business hours, where the value of the property that is taken or intended to be taken does not exceed nine hundred fifty dollars 459.5, subd. (a), italics added.) the trial court denied the petition on the ground that of a roddy timely appealed. contentions roddy contends he was eligible for resentencing under proposition 47 because to commit 459.5 muthe intent to commit counterfeit money to make a purchase qualifies as theft. the intent to commit is and here, roddy did not attempt to commit larceny. discussion this appeal turns on the interpretation of the term the interpretation of a statute is 4 subject to de novo review on appeal. (see kavanaugh v. west sonoma county union high school dist. (2003) 29 cal.4th 911, 916.) principles that govern statutory construction.

[citation.](ibid.) if the text is ambiguous and supports multiple interpretations, we may then turn to extrinsic sources such as ballot summaries and arguments for insight into the votintent. [citations.]kwikset corp. v. superior court, supra, at p. 321.) according to respondent, the voters intended section 459.5 to incorporate the common understanding of shoplifting, that is, a trespassory taking of property from a commercial establishment.3 the voters intended section 459.5 to encompass all kinds of theft, 3 the issue of whether the definition of shoplifting in section 459.5 requires an intent to commit larceny or theft of any kind is pending before the california supreme court. (see, e.g., people v. gonzales (2015) 242 cal.app.4th 35, review granted february 17, 2016, s231171; people v. vargas (2016) 243 cal.app.4th 1416, review granted march 30, 2016, s232673.) 5 criminal conduct did not involve larceny and, therefore, he was not eligible for resentencing. we first address the contention that the voters intended to limit section 459.5 to the of shoplifting. reference to the common understanding of that term. rather, commercial establishment during regular business hours with taken or intended to be taken does not exceed $950. although respondent urges us to consider the ballot materials in respondent does not point to any ambiguity in the statute that would allow us to do so.

(see people v. vidana (2016) 1 cal.5th 632 (vidana).) the full quote from vidana, from which respondent quotes only a portion, demonstrates that the court has not, in fact, disapproved of such a result, but only observed that section 490a has not yet been applied in that manner: effect a change in nomenclature without disturbing the substance section 490a to effect a change in nomenclature or to change the vidana, supra, at p. 647.) more importantly, in vidana, the court explained that to section 484 have repeatedly held that the legislation simplified the procedure of charging larceny, embezzlement, and false pretense, but did not change their elements. . . .
