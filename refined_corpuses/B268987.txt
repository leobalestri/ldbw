(people v. acosta, supra, 242 cal.app.4th at p. 526.) and, we held that it was unnecessary to reclassify attempted burglary of a vehicle as a misdemeanor in order to comply with the express intent of liberal construction of proposition 47.(ibid.) defendant acknowledges our holdings, but suggests that we should reconsider them a number of cases where the issue is whether statutes not enumerated in section [1170.18] may be eligible offenses u 5 none of the cases defendant cites, however, involved burglary in effect at the time of the offense may petition for a recall of sentence before the trial court that entered the judgment of conviction in his or her case to request resentencing in accordance with sections 11350, 11357, or 11377 of the health and safety code, or section 459.5, 473, 476a, 490.2, 496, or 666 of the penal code, as those sections have been amended or added by this act. 4 snotwithstanding section 487 or any other provision of law defining grand theft, obtaining any property by theft where the value of the money, labor, real or personal property taken does not exceed nine hundred fifty dollars ($950) shall be considered petty theft and shall be punished as a misdemeanor, except that such person may instead be punished pursuant to subdivision (h) of section 1170 if that person has one or more prior convictions for an offense specified in clause (iv) of subparagraph (c) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (e) of section 667 or for an offense requiring registration pursuant to subdivision (c) of section 290. 5 for example, defendant cites people v. gonzales (2016) s231171. the supreme courtpeople v. gonzales providesthis case presents the following issue: was defendant entitled to resentencing under penal code section 1170.18 on his conviction for second degree burglary either on the ground that it met the definition of 4 of a vehicle. defendant thus has not provided a compelling reason for us to reconsider our holdings in people v. acosta, supra, 242 cal.app.4th at p. 521.6 consistent with those , as second degree burglary of an motor vehicle is not entitled to relief under proposition 47. disposition the order is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. raphael, j. we concur: turner, p. j. kriegler, j. misdemeanor shoplifting (pen. code,  459.5) or on the ground that section 1170.18 impliedly includes any second degree burglary involving property valued at $950 or less? 6 because we hold that proposition 47 resentencing does not apply to burglary of an amount in question did not exceed $950 as defendant claimed in his petition. judge of the superior court of the county of los angeles, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
