(c)),1 and one count of assault by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury ( 245, subd. (a)(1)).2 prior to to those charges, he would be sentenced to two years and four months, to be served consecutively to the sentence he was already serving.3 during in-court discussions of the plea agreement, appellant was repeatedly assured by the prosecutor and the -strikes laws, section 667, subdivisions (b) through (i), and section 1170.12, subdivisions (a) through (d).4 in march 2000, california voters passed proposition 21, which became 192.7, subdivision (c).5 (see people v. superior court (andrades) (2003) 113 1 undesignated statutory references are to the penal code. 2 six other counts of battery and assault were dismissed as part of the plea agreement. 3 the offenses were committed while appellant was in state prison serving a sentence for burglary. 4 at the time, appellant had two strikes based on convictions for residential burglary and attempted robbery based on a single incident in june 1998. (see people v. benson (1998) 18 cal.4th 24, 36 [three-strikes statute permits qualifying prior to be treated as a strike even if sentence on conviction stayed pursuant to section 654].) 5 section 667, subdivision (d)(1) and section 1170.12, subdivision (b) define a strike 5 as a violent felony or any 3 people v. semien (2008) 162 cal.app.4th 701, 709-710; people v. winters (2001) 93 cal.app.4th 273, 276-277.) by an information filed in 2003 and amended in 2004, appellant, still in prison, was charged with assault with a deadly weapon and by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury ( 4501), possession of a weapon ( 4502, subd. (a)) and being an accessory to a felony ( 32). the information further alleged that appellant had suffered three prior strikes, including the 1999 assault on a peace officer to which he had pled guilty. appellant was tried and found guilty in 2004. after the jury rendered its verdict, there was a hearing to determine people v. benson, supra, 18 cal.4th 24, both convictions arising out of the june 1998 incident could be counted as strikes. with regard to the 1999 assault on a peace officer, the court stated: . . testimony that at the time he entered the plea to that offense in 1999 he was assured that it was not a strike is corroborated by the transcript of his entry of plea. and the explanation for that is that at the time he entered his plea in 1999 . . . it was not then a strike. . . . [] . . . [] . . .[a]ny . . . felony assault on a peace officer became a strike as a result of proposition [21], which was enacted by the people of the state of california at [the] election in the year 2000. . . . [] . . . [i]t was in effect in november . . . of 2001 when [appellant] committed the present crimes. [] if [appellant] had been improperly advised by his lawyer and the judge and the district attorney that the crime he was pleading guilty to was at the time not a strike, he might very well have some very good arguments to move to withdraw his plea in los angeles court for that misinformation, but he was not misadvised. he 4 was given [the] correct advice and no one . . . can expect that the [l]egislature or the people of the state of california will nev at the sentencing hearing that followed, the court sentenced appellant as a third strike offender. the court considered and denied a defense request to strike r record in this case were a brazen, unprovoked, cold-blooded attack on the victim here. it was brazen because . . . he knew he was doing it right under the eyes of the correctional officers; he knew he was doing it on camera; he knew he was doing it unprovoked, cold-blooded. it went on and on, seemingly for an eternity when one sits here and watches that video of [appellant] attacking, punching, slashing the attack. [] [appellant] is a person from whom the community needs to be coram nobis6 appellant contended the 1999 guilty plea was based on mistake, ignorance or misstatement, because he had been assured by the court and the prosecutor that he would not suffer any strikes if he pled guilty. the court denied the motion/petition. this appeal 6 section 1018 authorizes a trial court to allow a defendant to withdraw a guilty plea x months after an order of probation is made if entry of judgment is suspended. ( 1018; people v. gari (2011) 199 cal.app.4th 510, 521.) once those time limits have expired, a defendant may file a petition for writ of error coram nobis, which is regarded as equivalent in many respects to a motion to vacate the judgment. (people v. castaneda (1995) 37 cal.app.4th 1612, 1616-1618; people v. shipman (1965) 62 cal.2d 226, 229; people v. totari (2003) 111 cal.app.4th 1202, 1206; people v. lockridge (1965) 233 cal.app.2d 743, 745.) 5 followed. while the appeal was pending, appellant filed a petition for habeas corpus, contending his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to advise appellant that his 1999 guilty plea could result in a strike. discussion a. the trial court propercoram nobis the grounds on which a litigant may obtain relief via a writ of error coram nobis exists, from a judgment rendered while there existed some fact which would have prevented its rendition if the trial court had known it and which, through no people v. kim (2009) 45 cal.4th 1078, 1091, quoting people v. adamson (1949) 34 cal.2d 320, 326-people v. kim, supra, at p. 1093.) in basis for coram nobis ibid.) the remedy does not apply where the mistake was one of law. (ibid.) in people v. kim, the defendant, an immigrant who had a lengthy criminal record for petty theft and burglary, pled guilty in 1997 to a number of offenses, including petty theft with a prior theft-related conviction. (people v. kim, supra, uld result in deportation . . . and/or denial of ibid.) the immigration and naturalization service (ins) initiated proceedings for mandatory deportation. the ultimate basis asserted for deportation was the fact that the defendant had two prior convictions of crimes involving moral turpitude. (id. at pp. 1087-1088.) the defendant sought to vacate 6 the 1997 plea -- one of the two convictions -- on the ground of mistake of fact, contending he had been unaware (1) that he might face incarceration in south korea for his religious beliefs; and (2) that with minor changes, the plea could have been framed in a way to avoid the threatened deportation. (id. at p. 1089.) in t he had that an alternative plea to burglary, in the language of the statute, entry with intent crime of moral turpitude conviction, i believe there is a reasonable probability the pros(ibid.) the trial court granted the motion to vacate. on review, the supreme court concluded the defendant had not satisfy the strict (people v. kim, supra, 45 cal.4th at pp. 1101-facts . . . speak merely to the legal effect of his guilty plea and thus are not grounds for relief on coram nobisidthe possibility of deportation prior to entering his plea, and knowledge that the ins would actually seek to remove him from the country as a result of his conviction is coram nobis him speaks only to the relative risk of deportation, not the fact of deportation id. at p. 1102, fn. 14.) ware of a crucial fact when accepting the plea bargain fails for the reasons discussed in people v. kim. at the time appellant entered his plea, the charge of assaulting a peace officer under section 7 245, subdivision (c), was not a strike, as he was correctly informed. no fact concerning the then-existing nature of the offense was unknown to appellant or those who advised him in 1999. neither the court nor the prosecutor was required to apprise appellant of upcoming ballot initiatives or any other pending legislation. a strike was not a mistake of an existing fact, but was at most, a mistake concerning the potential future legal effect of his plea. our conclusion is supported by a recent appellate authority involving a similar attempt to vacate a guilty plea. in people v. gari, supra, 199 cal.app.4th 510, the defendant, a naturalized citizen, pled guilty to 10 counts of child molestation, admitting the offenses occurred between january 1989 and july 1991. however, in a 1989 document filed in support of his petition for citizenship, the ties learned of the plea agreement, they sought to revoke his citizenship on the ground that two of the offenses occurred in 1989, before he submitted the document. in a motion to vacate the plea, the defendant essentially contended he had not committed any acts of molestation in 1989 and that he had not focused on the dates of the charges to which he had pled, as he had not been advised that the guilty plea might result in revocation of his citizenship. the appellate court concluded the defendant had not met the requirements for issuance of a writ of error coram nobisfailed to satisfy the first requirement by showing the existence of a newly discovered fact which, had it been known, would have prevented rendition of the judgment of conviction. . . . [] . . . [] defendant does not identify any new facts that were unknown to him at the time he pleaded guilty to the charged offenses. instead, defendant asserts he pleaded guilty to the charged offenses without paying heed to the dates the prosecution alleged he had committed them because he lacked 8 knowledge of the legal effect of pleading guilty to those offenses might have on his citizenship status. . . . whether and when defendant committed those offenses are facts of which defendant had knowledge when he pleaded guilty to the charged offenses. these facts, therefore, do not qualify as newly discovered facts unknown to defendant at the time he pleaded guilty, which would support error coram nobis people v. gari, supra, at pp. 519-520.) appellant also contends, in effect, that the statements of the court and the district attorney in 1999, were bargained-for material terms of the plea agreement and that refusal to vacate the plea will result in a miscarriage of justice. (see in re moser (1993) 6 cal.4th 342, 353-358.) a similar contention was rejected in people v. paredes (2008) 160 cal.app.4th 496, where the defendant, a legal permanent resident, pled guilty to voluntary manslaughter in 1987. the plea agreement included the cdeportation (jrad). (id. at p. 498.) at the time, the jrad issued by the trial court prevented federal authorities from deporting the defendant. federal law subsequently changed, and in 2005, a federal immigration judge ordered the defendant removed from the united states. (id. at p. 501.) the defendant sought to vacate the 1987 plea and the trial court granted the relief sought. the court of uthority to change federal authority to promise the defendant that he would never be deported on the basis of ination that the postconviction changes in federal law that rendered [the defendant] potentially id. at pp. 511-512.) similarly here, the fact that intervening changes in the law rendered the 1999 plea agreement less favorable to appellant than the parties may have anticipated at the time did not require the court to vacate the agreement. when appellant agreed 9 to plead guilty to the crime of assault on a peace officer by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury, neither the trial court nor the prosecutor promised appellant that the law concerning the definition of a strike would not change or that if it did, the sentence for any future crime he committed would not be affected by the 1999 conviction. they simply informed him of the existing state of the law. there was no violation of the plea agreement. moreover, even were we to conclude that the plea agreement was violated or that the alleged mistake was the type to support granting coram nobis relief, diligence is prerequisite to the availability of [coram nobispeople v. kim, supra, 45 cal.4th at p. 1096, quoting people v. shorts (1948) 32 cal.2d 502, . . . the showing of diligence essential to the granting of relief by way of coram nobis should be no less than the similar showing required in civil cases where relief is sought against lately discovered fraud. in such cases it is necessary to aver not only the probative facts upon which the basic claim rests, but also the time and circumstances under which the facts were discovered, in order that the court can determine as a matter of law whether the litigant proceeded with due diligence; a mere allegation of the ultimate facts, or of the legal conclusion of diligence, is people v. kim, supra, at p. 1096, quoting people v. shorts, supra, at p. 513.) plea and the motion to withdraw the plea, the burden is on the defendant to explain and justify the delay. [citation.] the reason for requiring due diligence is obvious. substantial prejudice to the people may result if the case must proceed to people v. castaneda, supra, 37 cal.app.4th at p. 1618; accord, people v. totari, supra, 111 cal.app.4th at p. 1207.) 10 appellant filed a declaration in support of his motion to vacate/petition for writ of error coram nobis, but did not state when he learned that the nature of the section 245, subdivision (c) offense had changed in 2000 as the result of assuming there was a basis for him to wait final determination of the 2004 conviction to seek to withdraw his 1999 plea, this does not excuse his failure to file in a federal cdoes not describe the nature of this lawsuit or explain how it precluded him from seeking relief in the superior court until it ended. accordingly, the petition was properly denied on the alternate ground that appellant failed to establish that he proceeded with due diligence. b. trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to advise that the plea could be used to enhance a future sentence. in a separate petition for writ of habeas corpus, appellant contends he was denied the effective assistance of counsel because trial counsel failed to advise him 7 ineffective assistance of counsel results in the in re alvernaz (1992) 2 cal.4th 924, 934.) recently, in padilla v. kentucky (2010) 559 u.s. ___ 7 by order dated august 25, 2011, we invited the parties to submit additional briefing on the petition for writ of habeas corpus. we received none. 11 [130 s.ct 1473, 1483-1484], the united states supreme court held that where a defense attorney failed to advise a non-citizen client that deportation was a possible consequence of a guilty plea, such failure could represent ineffective assistance of counsel and could invalidate the plea. a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel requires the defendant to show prejudice. (strickland v. washington (1984) 466 u.s. 668, 693.) in the context of fell below an objective standard of reasonableness under prevailing professional norms; and (2) he or she hill v. lockhart (1985) 474 u.s. 52, people v. ledesma (1987) 43 cal.3d 171, 218, quoting strickland v. washington, supra, 466 u.s. at pp. 693-694.) preliminarily, we note that appellant did not present evidence to support that his defense counsel failed to advise him in 1999 when he entered a guilty plea to the charges, that the law might change to re-define the offenses as strikes. there is no declaration from trial counsel. appellantadvice received from counsel. appellant does provide the record of the discussions held in open court concerning the plea agreement, but that does not reflect what counsel may have told appellant privately. moreover, defense 12 lead to enhanced punishment is not a basis to invalidate a plea agreement.8 entering a guilty plea, the defendant must be advised of the direct consequences of the conviction.
