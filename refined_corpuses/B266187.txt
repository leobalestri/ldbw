[he entered a plea of] no contest[.] so as such, the court is going to find him in violation of his probation for the following reasons: one is the number of internal violations. based upon the reports, the no contest plea in [case no.] mm074717 in kern county for [driving under the influence] and in this case, i find testimony to be credible. the conditions of probation was driving with no measureable amount of alcohol in his system. he was driving with a measurable amount of alcohol in his system.[6] he was further putting society at risk by driving a vehicle by failing to install the [ignition interlock device] which is also maintained by probation as well. so as such, the court is going to find him in violation on all of the cases. starting first with [case no.] ta128120, e.s.s. sentence was previously imposed by judge conley. to honor that sentence. from that or not. i know if i want to terminate probation, i have that 6 presumably, the trial court was referring to the february 27, 2015, arrest referred to by deputy deschamps in his testimony. 10 terminating probation. time in county jail. the trial court then stated: on case [no.] 5av00161, the court finds he is in violation of probation. [the] court will sentence him to 180 days in county jail consecutive to any other time. probation will terminate upon completion of the jail time and [the] probation revocation fine previously imposed and stayed is imposed due to the violation on [case no.] 3av01935. the court finds [appellant] in violation as to count 1, the driving under the influence. the court will sentence him to 180 days in the county jail consecutive to any other time. as to count 2, additional consecutive 180 days in the county jail for a total of 360 days in the county jail. per minute order, ano. ta128120 was revoked for the reasons stated in the june 12, 2015 probation report. the trial court imposed two-year county jail sentence. this appeal followed. discussion appellant argues that there was insufficient evidence of a new probation violation occurring after the march 26, 2015, hearing and that we must reverse the order imposing sentence. this argument fails. there was ample evidence of new probation violations postdating the march 26, 2015 hearing. i. relevant law; standard of review. if the interests of justice so require and the court, in its judgment, has reason to believe that the person has violated any of the conditions of his or her probation.

(id. at p. 507.) ii. probation revocation supported by substantial evidence. the trial court orally stated that it found appellant in violation due to internal violations, a no contest plea in case no. mm074717, and the testimony of deputy deschamps establishing that appellant was driving with alcohol in his system and had no ignition interlock device. the minute order stated that probation was revoked for all the reasons stated in the june 12, 2015 probation report. appellant attacks multiple grounds for the probation revocation, yet he leaves at least three grounds unexamined, which is fatal to his appeal. the june 12, 2015, probation report recommended revocation, in part, based on appellant being arrested in kern county on a bench warrant on permission to leave los angeles county. another basis was that appellant did not report his arrest. yet another basis was the appellant had not paid any of the fines imposed upon him. in his appellate briefs, appellant does not explain why these facts do not amount to substantial evidence of probation violations supporting revocation. arguments not made are deemed waived. (tan v. california fed. sav. & loan assn. (1983) 140 cal.app.3d 800, 811.) (alvarez v. jacmar pacific pizza corp. (2002) 100 cal.app.4th 1190, 1206, fn. 11.) a judgment or order of the lower court is presumed correct. all 13 intendments and presumptions are indulged to support it on matters as to which the record is silent, and error must be affirmatively shown. this is not only a general principle of appellate practice but an ingredient of the constitutional doctrine of reversible error.denham v. superior court (1970) 2 cal.3d 557, 564.) based on the foregoing, there is no basis to reverse. we note that appellant argues that he did not have sufficient time to enroll in a domestic violence program prior to may 29, 2015. the record indicates that on march 26, 2015, he was given 30 days to enroll. he later told the probation department on april 21, 2015, that he had been released from custody two days earlier. dates of incarceration. in any event, we conclude that appellant had sufficient time to enroll between april 21, 2015, and may 29, 2015, and his failure constituted a probation violation. all other issues are moot.7 7 appellant filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus, case no. b271155. though the petition has been considered concurrently with this appeal, a separate order ruling on the petition will be filed in that matter. 14 disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. __________________________, acting p. j. ashmann-gerst we concur: _____________________________, j. chavez ____________________________, j. hoffstadt
