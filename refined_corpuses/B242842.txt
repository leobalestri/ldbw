[] i do anbefore i call her mother, although the penal code sort of asks that you use the support [] [] submit. [] have a problem with that. a) when m.g. took the stand, the trial court permitted mother to accompany her. m.g. testified that she was eight years old. m.g. demonstrated that was able to tell the 6 difference between telling the truth and telling a lie, and testified that she knows that telling the truth is good and telling a lie gets her in trouble. she said sometimes she lies; sometimes she tthe truth while testifying. m.g. testified that when she was seven years old, defendant, whom she described ant pulled her next to him. defendant touched her genitals under her clothes. defendant molested m.g. a again on her genitals. m.g. felt unhappy that defendant touched her. where defendant was, and c.g. told m.g. that the police took defendant away. m.g. was happy that defendant was removed from the house. c.g. told m.g. that defendant todid something similar to c.g. m.g. started crying and told c.g. that defendant also touched her. m.g. told c.g. and mother that defendant molested her, but m.g. did not know if she first told her mother or c.g. m.g. told mother about defendant sexually abusing her during a walk to the dentist office. b) mother testified at trial that she is the mother of c.g. and m.g. defendant was a childhhad financial trouble, and defendant assisted them financially. mother testified that early one morning, c.g. awakened her and c.g. was crying. c.g. told her that she was a--mother called the police, and defendant was arrested. mother testified that one or two weeks after defendant was arrested, c.g. told mother that defendant had touched m.g. mother asked m.g. about defendant molesting her when mother got home from the dentist, and m.g. said that defendant had touched her private parts more than once. 7 3. analysis defendant objected to m.g. being called to testify prior to mother testifying. this is one of his contentions on appeal. defendant, however, did not object regarding his support person was desired by, and helpful to m.g.3, and that the trial court failed to admoni4 defendant therefore forfeited the latter two contentions. could have been, but was not, made in the lower court. [citation.] the reason for this timely brought to the attention of the trial court, could have been easily corrected or rule ensures that the opposing party is given an opportunity to address the objection, and it prevents a party from engaging in people v. french (2008) 43 cal.4th 36, 46; people v. lord, supra, 30 if defendant did not forfeit his contentions that the prosecution failed at trial to show that discussed infra, any such errors were harmless. 3 at the preliminary hearing, mother acted as a support person for m.g. prior to mother acting in that role, the prosecutor asked m.g. if she would like her mother to sit behind her while she testified, and m.g. nodded her head yes. the prosecutor also stated that during a court recess, m.g. had said that she wanted her mother present because she was scared. 4 at the preliminary hearing, the trial court stated in or any form of nonverbal communication either during the course of her testimony. if you were to be communicating with her during her testimony, i would have to have you 8 the trial court erred in allowing m.g. to be called to testify before mother testified. section 868.5, subdivision (c) provides that the testimony of a support person shall be presented before the testimony of the prosecuting people v. patten (1992) 9 cal.app.4th 1718, 1729; people v. redondo (1988) 203 cal.app.3d 647, 654 from testifying on recall after the victim has testified is vastly outweighed by the cost of keeping admissible as a witness before calling mother as a witness is thaperson should testify before he or she acts as a support person for the victim-witness. the procedures used in connection therewith, however, was harmless under either chapman v. california (1967) 386 u.s. 12, 24 [harmless beyond a reasonable doubt], or people v. watson (1956) 46 cal.2d 818, 836 [reasonable probability of more favorable testifying herself, that encounter undermined tgave differed. m.g. testified, inter alia, about the circumstances of her being sexually contrast, mother testified, inter alia, about defendant assisting the family financially, c.g. telling her that defendant sexually abused her, calling the police, defendant being arrested, hearing about m.g. being sexually abused by defendant from c.g., and that she did not ask m.g. aoffice. there is no evidence or indication in the record that mother swayed or influenced 9 permitting mother to act as a support person without a showing that it was desired by, and testimony, and allowing m.g. to testify prior to mother, is harmless under any applicable standard. b. consecutive sentence on count 3 defendant contends that the trial court erroneously imposed a consecutive sentence for count 3 because it was in conflict with its earlier statement to impose a concurrent sentence for that count. we disagree. 1. background facts impose consecutive sentences as to counts 3, 4 and 5 under section 667.6, subdivision (c). it was further stated in that memorandum that because counts 3, 4, and 5, were committed sentences for counts three, four and five may be imposed concurrent with each other. [] [t]he sentences imposed for counts three, four and five must be collectively consecutive to the sentences imposed for counts one, two and six. [] thus, the total sentence sought by the people is 55 years to life as follows: 15 years to life on count one, a concurrent sentence of 15 years to life on count two, a consecutive sentence of 25 years to life on count three, a concurrent sentence of 25 [years] to life on count four, a concurrent sentence of 25 [years] to life on count five, and a consecutive sentence of at the sentencing hearing, the trial court sentenced defendant consistent with the consecutive to any other sentence. [] count 2 is 15 years to life, to run concurrent to any other sentence, and count 6 is 15 to life, to run consecutive to any other sentence. [] discretion and not impose consecutive sentence. [] . . . [] count 3, 25 to life 10 consecutive to any other sentence. count 4, 20 to life concurrent with any other sentence. count 5, 25 to life concurrent with any other sentence. [] total sentence in this case is 2. analysis to object that the trial court erroneously imposed a people v. mayham (2013) 212 cal.app.4th 847, 856; people v. french, supra, 43 cal.4th at p. 46 in re michael l. (1985) 39 cal.3d 81, ctions not presented to the trial court cannot be raised for the first time on even if defendant did not forfeit his contention that the trial court erroneously imposed a consecutive sentence for count 3, the contention is without merit. the trial court imposed a 25 years to life sentence for count 3 to run consecutive to the other not impose than a consecutive, sentence as to count 3, and its statement conflicted with the sentence exercise of judicial discretion in not imposing consecutive sentences for counts 3, 4, and 5 as to each other intended the sentences on counts 3, 4, and 5 to run in relation to the other remaining countscounts 1, 2 and 6. the trial court did not err. 11 c. presentence credits defendant contends that he is entitled to 96 more days of presentence custody credits, and the abstract of judgment should be amended accordingly. the attorney general agrees. section 1237.1 prohibits a defendant from appealing a judgment of conviction on defendant first presents the claim in the trial court at the time of sentencing, or if the error is not discovered until after sentencing, the defendant first makes a motion for correction for correction of the record in the trial court. counsel to file motion to correct a presentence award of credits in order to raise that (people v. acosta (1996) 48 cal.app.4th 411, 427.) defendant here appealed issues in addition to his claim regarding the computation of his presentence custody credits. defendant, therefore, was not required to first file a motion for correction with the trial court before he could raise his claim on appeal. in addition, although defendant did not object at the sentencing custody credits is purely mathematical and involves no discretion. (people v. aguirre (1997) 56 cal.app.4th 1135, 1139.) defendant was credited with 272 days of presentence custody, consisting of 237 days for actual time spent in custody, plus 15 percent of the actual time in custody for conduct credits (the limitation imposed by  2933.1)i.e., 35 days of conduct credit. defendant, however, spent 320 days in actual custody, not 237 daysthe period from the date of his arrest on september 9, 2011 to the date of sentencing on july 24, 2012 (2012 was court concluded that defendant was entitled to conduct credit in the amount of 15 percent of the actual time defendant was in custody, he was entitled to 48 days of conduct credit. defendant therefore is entitled to 368 days presentence credits, consisting of 320 days 12 actual custody credit and 48 days conduct credit. the abstract of judgment, accordingly, must be corrected to reflect the correct credits. d. mandatory surcharges and penalties the trial court ordered defendant to pay a $300 sexual offender program fund fee pursuant to section 290.3, but did not impose on defendant a $300 state penalty pursuant to section 1464, subdivision (a)(1); a $60 state surcharge pursuant to section 1465.7, subdivision (a); a $150 state court construction penalty pursuant to government code section 70372, subdivision (a); a $210 county penalty pursuant to government code section 76000, subdivision (a)(1); a $30 deoxyribonucleic acid penalty pursuant to government code section 76104.6, subdivision (a)(1); a $120 state-only deoxyribonucleic acid penalty pursuant to government code sections 76104.7, subdivision (a); and a $60 emergency medical services penalty pursuant to government code section 76000.5, subd. (a)(1). we therefore asked the parties to brief the issue of whether the trial court erred in failing to impose these surcharges and penalties on defendant. f additional penalties and surcharges upon every fine, penalty or forfeiture imposed for a people v. walz (2008) 160 cal.app.4th 1364, 1371-1372; see people v. corrales (2013) 213 cal.app.4th 696, 702; people v. castellanos (2009) 175 cal.app.4th 1524, 1530.) the trial court therefore erred in failing to impose them despite ordering defendant to pay a $300 sexual offender program fund fee pursuant to section 290.3. section 290.3 provides that if the accused cannot afford to pay the fine, the trial court is prohibited from imposing it. the total amount payable for the sexual offender program fund fee with the additional penalties and surcharges is $1,230. upon remittutur issuance, therefore, the trial court is to conduto pay the sexual offender program fund fee in light of his total financial obligations. (see people v. corrales, supra, 213 cal.app.4th at p. 702.) 13 disposition the sexual offender program fund fee pursuant to section 290.3 is reversed and remanded to the trial court. upon remittutur issuance, the trial court is to determine ial circumstances. if defendant does have the ability to pay, the sexual offender program fund fee is to be reinstated with the additional penalties and surcharges, which are the following: the state penalty pursuant to section 1464, subdivision (a)(1); the state surcharge pursuant to section 1465.7, subdivision (a); the state court construction penalty pursuant to government code section 70372, subdivision (a); the county penalty pursuant to government code section 76000, subdivision (a)(1); the deoxyribonucleic acid penalty pursuant to government code section 76104.6, subdivision (a)(1); the state-only deoxyribonucleic acid penalty pursuant to government code sections 76104.7, subdivision (a); and the emergency medical services penalty pursuant to government code section 76000.5, subd. (a)(1). the matter is remanded to the trial court also to amend the abstract of judgment to reflect that defendant is entitled to 368 days presentence credits, consisting of 320 days actual custody credit and 48 days conduct credit. in all other respects, the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. mosk, j. we concur: turner, p. j. kumar, j. judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
