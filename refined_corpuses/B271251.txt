(pen. code,  12021, subd. (a)(1), now found at  29800, subd. (a)).1 at trial, peter salazar testified that while playing in a tree house in his backyard, he heard several gunshots. from his tree house, salazar saw defendant shooting at a tire. defendant then turned around and pointed the gun at salazar. michael winters, who lived in the neighborhood, testified that he heard four gunshots, followed by a three more gunshots, and saw defendant and two other black men coming from an alley. about 30 minutes later, winters identified defendant at a field identification lineup; he also identified defendant in court. the jury found defendant guilty of the section 12021 allegation. in a bifurcated proceeding, it also found that he had suffered two prior serious or violent felony convictions. ( 667, subds. (b)-(i), 1170.12, subds. (a)-(d).) the trial court imposed a sentence of 25 years to life under the three strikes law. the conviction was affirmed on appeal. (people v. oatis [dec. 4, 1996, b098100] nonpub. opn.) in november 2012, the voters approved proposition 36, which amended the three strikes law by limiting the imposition of an indeterminate life sentence to those defendants whose third felony is defined as serious or violent under sections 667.5 or 1192.7. the initiative allowed those serving a life sentence for a third felony that is not defined by those sections as serious or violent to petition to recall their sentence and for resentencing. ( 1170.126, subd. (b).) 1 all further undesignated statutory references are to the penal code. 3 in march 2013, defendant petitioned to recall his sentence and for resentencing under proposition 36. ( 1170.126.) the trial court conducted an eligibility hearing at which it considered the pleadings, trial transcript, and arguments of both counsel. at the conclusion of the hearing, the court denied the petition on the ground that defendant was resentencing. (667, subd. (e)(2)(c)(iii), 1170.126, subd. (e)(2).) this timely appeal followed. discussion by its terms, proposition 36 precludes the resentencing of a defendant who, during the commission of the current offense, used a firearm, was armed with a firearm or subd. (e)(2)(c)(iii); 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(c)(iii); 1170.126, subd. (e)(2).) defendant argues that the armed-with-a-firearm exclusion applies only if there is some other offenseother than mere possession of a firearmto which the arming was tethered. he contends that because a firearm possession offense has no underlying felony, he could not have been armed with a firearm during the commission of the current offense. the construed to mean having a firearm available for use, either offensively or defensively. (e.g.,  1203.06, subd. (b)(3); health & saf. code,  11370.1, subd. (a); people v. bland (1995) 10 cal.4th 991, 997 (blandpeople v. osuna (2014) 225 cal.app.4th 1020, 1029 (osuna); see people v. brimmer (2014) 230 cal.app.4th 782, 796fensive or defensive use].) we conclude the trial court properly applied the exclusionary provision in the initiative statute. moreover, the trial testimony shows that defendant also could have been charged with brandishing a firearm at salazar in an attempt to silence him. ( 417, subd. (a) [brandishing a weapon is punishable as a misdemeanor].) several courts have rejected the contention that in order for the armed-with-a- to which the 4 people v. hicks (2014) 231 cal.app.4th 275, 283.) in hicks, for example, the court concluded the defendant was statutorily ineligible for resentencing due to the ssession offense.2 (id. at p. 284; osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at pp. 10321033 [same]; see people v. elder (2014) 227 cal.app.4th 1308, 1317 [prior appellate opinion showed defendant was armed during unlawful possession of firearm]; people v. white (2014) 223 cal.app.4th 512, 525526 [same].) in osuna, the court reasoned that more serious and/or violent felonies in the past, and most recently had a firearm readily available for use, simply does not pose litpresented by a firearm increases in direct proportion to its accessibility. obviously, a [citation.] [] in light disqualification for resentencing under proposition 36 requires an underlying offense or enhancement to have been pled and proved, and that a conviction for possession of a firearm cannot c (osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1038; see people v. caraballo (2016) 246 cal.app.4th 936, 940941 [because peinvolved firearm possession-appellate court reasoned that resentencing an inmate who was vicariously armed with a firearm during the commission of the current offense.) the conclusion that resentencing if he or she was armed with a firearm during the unlawful possession of that 2 the supreme court recently granted review in people v. estrada (2015) 243 cal.app.4th 336, review granted, april 13, 2016, s232114, which cited hicks for the proposition that an appellate court may rely on a prior appellate opinion in determining that the defendant was armed when he committed the offense, even though the arming enhancement had not been pleaded or proven. (243 cal.app.4th at p. 342.) in this case, because the court was provided with the trial transcript, it was able to ascertain the facts of the offense without having to rely entirely on the prior appellate opinion. 5 osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1032), is consistent with the analysis contained in the voter information guide for proposition 36.
