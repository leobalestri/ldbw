(a)(4)). appellant was alleged to have committed the crimes with a firearm for the benefit of a street gang (pen. code,  186.22, subd. (b)(1), pen. code,  12022.53, subd. (b)), and was also subject to a hate crime enhancement. (pen. code,  422.75, subd. (b).) appellant filed a penal code section 995 motion to challenge the gun use allegation, and it was amended to allege only that a principal in offense, not appellant himself, was armed with a gun. the assault charge was amended to allege assault with a gun rather than by force. (pen. code,  245, subd. (a)(2).) appellant pled no contest to robbery and one of the assault charges, and admitted the gang, gun, and hate crime enhancements. the court sentenced appellant to 12 years in state prison and awarded him 198 days actual custody credit and 30 days good time/work time credit. he was also assessed a $10 crime prevention fine (pen. code,  1202.5), a $30 criminal convictions assessment (gov. code,  70373), and a $40 court operations assessment (pen. code,  1465.8, subd.
