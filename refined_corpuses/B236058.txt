(pen. code,  211, 496.) the trial court thereafter suspended imposition of sentence and placed barnum on formal probation for a period of three years. barnum contends, and the attorney general concedes, that california law generally prohibits dual convictions for both theft and receiving stolen property if it involves the same property. (pen. code,  496, subd. (a); people v. smith (2007) 40 cal.4th 483, 522.) we agree that barnum may not be convicted of both stealing and receiving the same bicycle. therefore, his conviction for receiving stolen property may not stand. disposition defendants conviction for receiving stolen property is reversed and the judgment is otherwise affirmed. bigelow, p. j. we concur: flier, j. grimes, j.
