(people v. page (2017) 3 cal.5th 1175 (page).) we requested further briefing to address the effects of page on this case. the parties agree that defendant is entitled to file a new petition to allow him to assert facts that may render him eligible for a reduction under sections 490.2 and 1170.18. motion without prejudice to consideration of a future petition providing evidence s 490.2 and 1170.18. factual and procedural background at a preliminary hearing on march 3, 2014, los angeles police officer jack stannard testified that he witnessed defendant driving a 1992 mazda b2200 pickup truck on february 17, 2014. stannard stopped2 and searched defendant, and found defendant to be in possession of described as a vehicle key that has the side ridges and face 1 all further statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise indicated. 2 the reason for the stop is not revealed in the record on appeal. 3 the shaved key was able to start the mazda pickup. the title was in the name of erik r.3 erik r. testified that although title of the pickup was in his name, several months earlier he had sold the truck to victor c. at the hearing, defense counsel asked erik r. how much victor c. paid for the truck. the prosecution objected, and the court sustained the objection. defense counsel also asked how many miles were on the truck when it was sold, and again the victor c. testified that he purchased the pickup in november 2016. he did not know defendant and had not given him permission to drive the truck. victor c. also said that the title to the vehicle had been in the glove compartment of the truck earlier that day, and he had not yet transferred the title into his name because he had not had time to do it. the los angeles county district attorney (the people) filed an information charging defendant with felony driving or taking a vehicle after a prior conviction, in violation of section 666.5 (count 1) and misdemeanor driving while privilege suspended for a prior conviction for driving under the influence in violation of vehicle code section 14601.2 (count 2). the information further alleged that defendant suffered ten prior convictions ( 667.5, subd.

(see cal. rules of court, rule 8.90(b)(4).) 4 in july 2014, defendant pled guilty to both counts pursuant to a plea agreement. the court imposed a ten-year sentence, calculated as the high term of four years as the base term on count 1, six months on count 2 to be served concurrently, and six consecutive one-year terms for six prior prison terms under section 667.5, subdivision (b). the court suspended the sentence, placed defendant on probation for three years, ordered him to a one-year residential drug treatment program, and imposed various fines and fees. months later in september 2014. defendant admitted to the probation violation. the court reinstated probation on september 10, 2014. as revoked again in june 2015. at the probation violation hearing in october 2015, defendant asked the court to consider reducing count 1 to a misdemeanor under proposition 47. the court questioned whether a violation of vehicle code section 10851 (section 10851)4 was eligible for reduction under proposition 47, but allowed defendant the opportunity to brief the issue. defense counsel did not file a written motion, but at the subsequent hearinshould qualify for a reduction because because defendant was not a danger to society. the prosecution disagreed, asserting that section 666.5 is a penalty provision . . . which is no the court held that 4 take[ ] a vehicle not his or her own, without the consent of the owner thereof, and with intent either to permanently or temporarily deprive the owner thereof of his or her title to or ( 10851, subd.

(people v. rivera (2015) 233 cal.app.4th 1085, 1089 (rivera).) proposition 47 makes certain drug- and theft-related offenses misdemeanors, unless the offenses were committed by certain ineligible defendants. these offenses had previously been designated as either felonies or wobblers (crimes that can (id. at p. 1091.) provision: section 1170.18. under section 1170.18, a person misdemeanor under proposition 47, may petition for a recall of that sentence and request resentencing in accordance with the statutes that were added or amended by proposition 47. ( id. at p. 1092.) proposition 47 also added section 490.2 to the penal code. (rivera, supra, 233 cal.app.4th at p. 1091.) section 490.2 states law defining grand theft, obtaining any property by theft where the value of the money, labor, real or personal property taken does not exceed nine hundred fifty dollars ($950) shall be in his opening brief, defendant argued that his conviction if the 6 vehicle taken had a value of less than $950, the conviction necessarily falls under the definition of misdemeanor petty theft in section 490.2. respondent attorney general asserted that convictions for taking vehicles under section 10851 do not fall under the purview of proposition 47. while this appeal was pending, the supreme court decided page, supra, 3 cal.5th 1175. in that case, the defendant was serving a sentence for a violation of section 10851, and he sought relief under proposition 47. the trial court and court of appeal held that violations of section 10851 were not affected by proposition 47. vehicle code section 10851 may . . . be resentenced under section 1170.18 if the person can show the vehicle was worth $950 or (page, supra, 3 cal.5th at p.1180.) the page opinion noted that section 10851 includes both theft offenses and non-not only taking a vehicle, but also driving it without s consent, and with intent either to permanently or temporarily deprive the owner thereof of his or her title to or possession of the vehicle, whether with or without intent to steal the vehicle (veh. code,  10851, subd. (a), italics added.) theft, in contrast, requires a taking with intent to steal the propertythat is, the intent to permanently deprive the owner of its possession. (page, supra, 3 cal.5th at p. 1182.) the court stated, btaining an automobile worth $950 or less by theft constitutes petty theft under section 490.2 and is punishable only as a misdemeanor, regardless of the statutory section under (id. at p. 1187.) thus, a 7 serving a felony sentence for taking or driving a vehicle in violation of vehicle code section 10851 is therefore eligible for resentencing under section 1170.18, subdivision (a), if the vehicle was worth $950 or less and the sentence was imposed for theft of (ibid.) we asked the parties for briefing to address how the page ruling affected the issues in this case. the parties acknowledge that a defendant seeking resentencing under section 1170.18 bears the burden of establishing his or her eligibility. (see, e.g., page, supra, p. 1187 section 1170.18 bears the burden of establishing his or her because defendant did not present evidence of his eligibility below, both parties request that we remand the case without prejudice to defendant bringing a new petition supported by evidence that would meet the page standards. without prejudice; the attorney general asks that the order be affirmed without prejudice. [w]e we review the ruling, not the (people v. zamudio (2008) 43 cal.4th 327, 351 fn. 11.) was erroneous because, pursuant to the reasoning in page, a conviction under section 10851 is not ineligible under proposition 47 as a matter of law.5 nevertheless, 5 page involved a conviction under section 10851. here, defendant was convicted of violating section 666.5, which allows for additional penalties when a defendant has a prior conviction for violating 10851, and suffers a subsequent conviction under section 10851. ( 666.5, subd. (a).) tbriefs do not address whether proposition 47 applies to a conviction under section 666.5. (see, e.g., people v. carter (1996) 8 defendant was ineligible for relief under proposition 47 because he did not meet his burden to show his conviction was eligible for resentencing. we therefore affirm. disposition the order resentencing is affirmed without prejudice to any future motion defendant may bring pursuant to proposition 47. not to be published in the official reports collins, j. we concur: willhite, acting p. j. manella, j. enacting penal code section 666.5 was to increase the given that the parties agree that the case should be remanded for further proceedings in light of page, we do not address that issue here.
