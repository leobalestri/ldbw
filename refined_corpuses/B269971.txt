(a) & 664), (2) first degree residential burglary ( 459), and (3) receiving stolen property ( 496, subd. (a)). the people further alleged, with respect to the burglary count, that defendant personally used a firearm ( 12022.5, subd. (a)) and that he personally inflicted great bodily injury ( 12022.7, subd. (a)). a jury convicted defendant of second degree burglary and receiving stolen property, but acquitted him of attempted murder he burglary count. the trial court sentenced defendant to prison for 27 years to life. on the burglary count, the court imposed 27 years to life, comprised of (1) a third strike base sentence of 25 years to life because defconvictions constituted strikes within the meaning of the three strikes law ( 667, subds.

(g).) extensive criminal history. as a juvenile, defendant committed the crimes of burglary ( 459) and receiving stolen property ( 496) in april 1980; was sent to the california youth authority in january 1981, after he violated his probation; escaped from the california youth authority in september 1981; and thereafter committed the crimes of burglary 4 ( 459) and receiving stolen property ( 496) in november 1981, doing so while carrying a loaded .38-caliber revolver. defendant was convicted of several more crimes as an adult. in january 1984, while on parole from the california youth authority, defendant committed a strong-arm robbery ( 211) using a baseball bat. after release from the ensuing three-year prison sentence and while still on parole, defendant in september 1986, committed another strong-arm robbery ( 211), this time holding after release from the resulting two-year prison sentence and while still on parole, defendant in august 1990, possessed a gun stolen from a police officer ( 496). while on probation for the stolen gun conviction and under pain of a five-year suspended prison sentence, defendant in december 1991, fired 10 shots at a person and was subsequently convicted of assault with a firearm ( 245, subd. (a)(2)) and unlawfully possessing a firearm ( 12022, subd. (a)). defendant was on probation for the assault conviction under pain of a 16-year prison sentence when he committed the crimes that are the subject of this appeal. during the trial in this matter, moreover, defendant pantomimed firing a gun by putting his finger to his head while one of the victims was on the stand. prison, as well as his rehabilitative efforts. in addition to a number of minor infractions, defendant committed the following violations: (1) he was disrespectful to prison staff in june 2001; (2) he did not report to work in november 2002; (3) he circumvented the jailhouse telephone procedures in october 2003; (4) he was late to work in november 2004; and (5) he engaged in mutual combat in january 2007, when he bear hugged (but did not punch) a fellow inmate. while in prison, 5 defendant worked as a dining hall worker and a building porter. defendant also participated in a few courses soon after his admission to prisonnamely, an orientation course and a shop and site safety course in april 1998, and a parenting class in march 2001. after filing his proposition 36 petition, defendant completed a three-day basic workshop on alternatives to violence in october 2013; a three-day advanced course on alternatives to violence in february 2014; a one-hour course on hypertension in january 2015; a course on life skills/anger management in february 2015; and a course on life skills/stress management in february 2015. the trial court further considered evidence that (1) prison score, which evaluates the level of security under which he should be incarcerated, started at 59 (on a 100-point scale) and steadily dropped to 19 (which is the lowest possible level for a prisoner with his sentence); (2) defendant had been accepted into a post-release program to assist with his transition from prison and had received an offer to enroll in another post-release program; (3) defendant had non-validated association with the crip-hoover 74th street gang and, in november 2009, possessed paraphernalia associated with the black guerrilla family prison ganga silver back gorilla,relatives and others attested to his good character; and (5) an expert employed by the defense submitted a written report and sess an unreasonable risk of dangerousness to public safety the court acktime of the evidentiary hearing) put him in a population that presents a statistically lower risk of re-offendingand that 6 however, the court observed that scalated significantly over time, becoming more violent and often what is more, the court noted that most of these crimes were committed while defendant was on probation or parole, and that even a 16-year suspended prison sentence did not deter defendant from committing the underlying crimes. the court recognized that this that he currently poses an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety, but found that other evidence nexus namely, (1) a lack of rehabilitative programming, (2) inadequate post-release plans, and (3) his gang associations. rehabilitative programming occurred after defendant filed his -entry progra the court further observed tany trade or and that his acceptance into two post-release programs could not overcome his lack of any skills -bpose an unreasonable risk of defendant filed a timely notice of appeal. discussion rikes law required a trial court to impose a minimum sentence of 25 years to life in prison 7 for a defendant convicted of a felonyno matter what the felony- 667, subd. (e)(2)(a) & 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(a).) proposition 36 changed this law. prospectively, the proposition modifies the three strikes law so that the minimum 25-years-to-life sentence may in most cases only be imposed for a third or subsequent felony conviction if that conviction is also a serious or violent felony. ( 667, subd. (e)(2)(c) & 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(c).) retrospectively, the proposition entitles defendants previously sentenced on a nonserious and nonviolent felony to a 25-years-to-life sentence under the three strikes law to petition for resentencing on that offense. ( 1170.126, subd. (b).) whether a defendant is entitled to that resentencing (and thus to an earlier release) turns on (1) whether he is eligible for relief and, if so, (2) whether he is suitable for reliefwould pose an unreasonable risk o( 1170.126, subd. (f).) it is undisputed that defendant is eligible for proposition 36 relief. defendant argues that the trial court erred in denying his proposition 36 petition for resentencing because (1) the court applied the incorrect legal standard for assessing his suitability for relief, not suitable is not supported by substantial evidence. the first issue turns on questions of statutory interpretation, which we review de novo. (people v. prunty (2015) 62 cal.4th 59, 71.) the standard of rea defendant is not suitable for resentencing under proposition 36 is unsettled: review could be for an abuse of discretion because proposition 36 entrusts the suitability determination to the trial 8 substantial evidence because the suitability determination rests on some evidencebecause the prognostication of risk required by proposition 36 is people v. superior court (kaulick) (2013) 215 cal.app.4th 1279, 1306, fn. 29 (kaulick)). we need not select a standard because, as discussed below, second claim lacks merit even if we employ the more rigorous substantial evidence and abuse of discretion standards, which call upon us to assess whether the evidence is sufficient for a rational trier of fact to come to the same conclusion and ricious. (haraguchi v. superior court (2008) 43 cal.4th 706, 711-712; people v. zamudio (2008) 43 cal.4th 327, 357; cf. in re shaputis (2011the e is some evidence in the record that supports the . . . decision i. the standard for assessing suitability proposition 36 explicitly sets forth the factors that a trial to e[[whether] resentencing the [defendant] would pose an conviction history, including the type of crimes committed, the extent of injury to victims, the length of prior prison commitments, adiscretion, determines to be relevant in deciding whether a new sentence would result in an unreasonable risk of danger to public 9 defendant asserts that the trial court erred in applying these factors because, in his view, the court should have applied three different standards. we examine each in turn. a. the proposition 47 standard two years after proposition 36 was enacted, the voters in november 2014, enacted proposition 47. ( 1170.18.) proposition - and theft-related charged as fel(that is, offenses that are punishable as a felony until a court reduces them to a misdemeanor) and ultimately sentenced as felonies. (people v. lynall (2015) 233 cal.app.4th 1102, 1108.) like proposition 36, proposition 47 has a retrospective component that entitles persons sentenced to these low-level felonies to petition for resentencing. ( 1170.18, subds. (f) & (g).) also, like proposition 36, proposition 47 tasks a court with determining whether the defendant seeking resentencing would ( 1170.18, subd.

(e)(2)(c)(iv).) 11 903-913, review granted jan. 11, 2017, s238790 (buford).)3 our supreme court has agreed to review this question. (see chaney, supra, 231 cal.app.4th 1391, review granted; valencia, supra, 232 cal.app.4th 514, review granted.) in the meantime, we are persuaded by the majority position, and we will not revisit the identical arguments defendant raises here and that have been rejected by these decisions. however, defendant raises one additional argument not addressed above. he contends that in re estrada (1965) 63 cal.2d 740 (estrada) mandates the retroactive application of roposition 36. in our view, estrada is doubly irrelevant. to begin, estrada erects a 3 our supreme court, as explained below, has granted review on this issue, and this grant of review has resulted in the complete or partial depublication of every other published decision on the issue. (compare people v. florez (2016) 245 cal.app.4th 1176, 1190-1196 (2016), review granted june 8, 2016, s234168 proposition 36]; people v. myers (2016) 245 cal.app.4th 794, 801-804, review granted may 25, 2016, s233937 [same]; people v. sledge (2015) 235 cal.app.4th 1191, 1212, review granted july 8, 2015, s226449 [same]; people v. guzman (2015) 235 cal.app.4th 847, 853-857, review granted june 17, 2015, s226410 [same]; people v. davis (2015) 234 cal.app.4th 1001, 1006, review granted june 10, 2015, s225603 [same]; people v. chaney (2014) 231 cal.app.4th 1391, review granted feb. 18, 2015, s223676 (chaney) [same]; people v. valencia (2014) 232 cal.app.4th 514, review granted feb. 18, 2015, s223825 (valencia) [same] with people v. cordova (2016) 248 cal.app.4th 543, 547-548, review definition to proposition 36].) 12 punishment for a particular criminal offense is intended to apply people v. brown (2012) 54 cal.4th 314, 324; estrada, at p. 744.) although the resentencing defendant seeks under proposition 3estrada deftrike conviction and sentence became final a long time ago when his ability for direct review of that conviction and sentence expired. (people v. smith (2015) 234 cal.app.4th 1460, 1464-1465 [conviction becomes final when time to appeal and file a petition for writ of certiorari expires].) further, estrada speaks to whether a newly enacted provision that applies to a conviction or sentence is to be applied retroactively; it does not speak to the precursor question whether the newly enacted provision applies in the first place. we have before us that precursor question: does proposition 47definition apply to proposition 36 in the first place? estrada says nothing on that question. b. the suitability inquiry under proposition 36 looks to unreasonable risk of danger to seems to suggest that this requires something more than just a -of-unreasonable argument. as an initial matter, the distinction defendant proposition 36 aas defendant portrays. (e.g., in re moses (2010) 182 cal.app.4th 1279, 1303-1304 (moses) interchangeably in a parole case].) moreover, the out-of-state 13 cases defeof tort law. (e.g., wagoner v. waterslide, inc. (utah ct.app. 1987) 744 p.2d 1012, 1013; (ky. 2013) 413 s.w.3d 891, 899 & fn. 26.) we decline to displace the stanactions. c. the risk of violent crimes standard danger to public safetyis likely to commit violent crimes. ( 1170.126, subd. (f), italics added.) he cites no authority for the broad proposition that only those persons who commit violent crimes present a risk of danger to public safety. ii. substantiality of evidence supporting suitability finding the people bear the burden of proving that a defendant poses an by a preponderance of the evidence. (kaulick, supra, 215 cal.app.4th at p. 1305; buford, supra, 4 cal.app.5th at pp. 895-898, review granted.)4 the trial court concluded that the people carried this 4 at least one court has held that the people must prove a ty beyond a reasonable doubt. (people v. arevalo (2016) 244 cal.app.4th 836, 842.) every subsequent decision has disagreed with arevalo. (people v. frierson (2016) 1 cal.app.5th 788, 793-794, review granted oct. 19, 2016, s236728; people v. newman (2016) 2 cal.app.5th 718, 730-732, review granted nov. 22, 2016, s237491; buford, supra, 4 cal.app.5th at pp. 895-898, review granted.) the issue is now before our supreme court in frierson and newman. the issue is 14 burden after considering the evidence and testimony submitted, filtering them through the three factors set forth in proposition 36, and ultimately concluding that the totality of that evidence indicated that defendant currently posed an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. analysis. first, he argues that the court erred in rejecting his danger to public safety, particularly when there was no contrary expert opinion. there was no error because the court, as the trier of fact, was free to disregard that opinion in light of the other evidence presented. (people v. brown (2014) 59 cal.4th 86, 101.) second, defendant asserts that the trial court erred by of his prior criminal history and in failing to connect his prior criminal history to his current risk of danger. (moses, supra, 182 cal.app.4th at pp. 1303-1304 [prohibiting the same in making parole decisions].) however, the court did no such thing: the court recognized that the proper focus was on currently poses an unreasonable not enough to prove risk, but concluded that other evidence current risknamely, (1) a lack of rehabilitative programming, (2) inadequate post-release plans, and (3) his gang associations. third, defendant asserts that the trial court erred when it stated that he had made no plans for reintegration into the community if he were released. again, the court did no such thing. the court recognized that defendant had signed up with not relevant to this case because defendant does not dispute the applicability of the preponderance of the evidence standard. 15 two post-release programs, but found this insufficient to ensure he would not revert to a life of crime because he had developed no rated. fourth, defendant contends that the trial court erred in placing weight on the fact that he undertook nearly all of his rehabilitative efforts after filing his proposition 36 petition; such efforts, he contends, are relevant no matter when they occur. however, the it elected to accord them less weight because their timing indicated that for rehabilitation was to obtain release, a motivation he would no longer have if released into the lack of motivation to pursue re-entry efforts once back in the community is a relevant consideration. lastly, defendant asserts that the trial court should have discounted his entire criminal history due to its age. the court had reverted to committing crimes whenever he was released, and that being on parole or probation had not deterred that criminal behavior. the court was also undoubtedly aware that commission of any crime after 1995 was due in part to his incarceration during that entire period. at bottom, defendant seems to contend that the trial court did not properly weigh the evidence presented. but it is not our place to reweigh the evidence. (people v. covarrubias (2016) 1 cal.5th 838, 890.) the evidence presented was sufficient; the accordingly have no basis to disturb its ruling. 16 disposition the order is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. ______________________, j. hoffstadt we concur: _________________________, acting p. j. ashmann-gerst _________________________, j.* goodman * retired judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
