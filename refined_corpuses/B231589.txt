(a)) and one count of possession for sale of a controlled substance (health & saf. code,  11351). defendant contends that (1) the trial court abused its discretion in failing to strike his strike priors and sentence him to less than 25 years to life for the sale of 10 pills of vicodin, and (2) his due process rights were violated because he was not advised his presumptive second strike case was going to be elevated to a 25-years-to-life case after he elected to go to trial. we affirm. factual background and procedural history defendant was charged in a two-count information filed may 14, 2010 with one count of offering to sell a controlled substance, hydrocodone, in violation of health and safety code section 11352, subdivision (a) and one count of possession for sale of a controlled substance, hydrocodone, in violation of health and safety code section 11351, arising out of the december 11, 2009 sale of 10 vicodin tablets for which defendant had a valid prescription to an undercover officer. the information charged defendant had a prior conviction within the meaning of health and safety code section 11370.2, subdivision (a), and further alleged that defendant had five prior strike convictions within the meaning of penal code sections 1170.12,1 subdivisions (a) through (d), and 667, subdivisions (b) through (i).2 1. prosecution case on december 11, 2009, at about 6:50 p.m., defendant was in front of the rite aid pharmacy at fifth and broadway in los angeles. los angeles police department 1 all statutory references herein are to the penal code unless otherwise indicated. 2 infra, consisted of one count of rape by force or fear ( 261, subd.

defendant sold him some of the pills defendant had in his possession; and defendant had in his possession bills of small denominations consistent with the sale of pills. further, the transaction was conducted in a fashion similar to numerous other undercover drug buys officer gamboa had made. vicodin for defendant to treat chronic lower back pain caused by degenerative disk 3 used in a drug transaction, police write down the serial numbers of money they use to purchase illicit substances. 4 the generic component of vicodin is hydrocodone. 4 disease. defendant had metallic fragments in his lower back that resulted from a gunshot wound. dr. chien prescribed five tablets a day for a 30-day total of 150 tablets. 2. defense case defendant testified on his own behalf that he received $954 per month in social security income. he has had severe back pain since 1978. dr. chien prescribed him vicodin for the pain, and he took five pills per day. he denied selling the vicodin on a regular basis. defendant received his prescription in two bottles, one with 120 pills and one with 30 pills. he split the prescription between the two bottles into two 75-pill allotments so he could carry one bottle at a time. on the evening of december 11, 2009, defendant was walking his dog at the corner of fifth and broadway. the area was very crowded. defendant intended to go to the 7-eleven across the street and get a drink so he could take a pill. officer gamboa ut his dog. officer man, come on . . . gamboa the vicodin, he was arrested. defendant denied he was standing on the corner asking people if they needed pills, and asserted that the sale to officer gamboa was the only time he sold his vicodin. convictions found all trprior strike convictions pursuant to romero v. superior court (1996) 13 cal.4th 497 (romero), the court sentenced defendant to a total term of 25 years to life on count one, and pursuant to section 654 stayed his sentence of 25 years to life on count two. the court struck the prior prison term enhancement and the health and safety code section 11370.2 enhancement. 5 discussion i. refusal to strike prior strike priors defendant argues the trial court abused its discretion in failing to strike his prior strike convictions because the possession and sale of 10 pills of vicodin falls outside the people v. strong (2001) 87 cal.app.4th 328 (strong) and people v. gaston (1999) 74 cal.app.4th 310 (gaston) on which the trial court relied, and argues the relevant factors support striking the priors and sentencing him as a second strike offender. he further argues the resulting sentence of 25 years to life violates the eighth and fourteenth amendment and is cruel and unusual punishment because the sentence is grossly disproportionate to the crime committed and, because defendant was 62 years old at the time of sentencing, sentences him to a virtual life sentence. a. factual background sentenced to 25 years to life under the three strikes law based upon his prior criminal history, including the five prior strikehealth and safety code section 11350, subdivision (a) violation in 1987, and a two-year prison sentence for a health and safety code section 11351 violation in 1988. further, defendant had an extensive criminal history dating back to 1964, when he was arrested for larceny in virginia and received 12 months of probation. in 1965, while in custody, defendant received a 12-month sentence for assaulting a guard; in 1968, 1971, and 1975, defendant was convicted of charges of burglary and larceny, receiving a sentence of eight years for the 1975 conviction. in 1979, defendant was fined for a conviction of petty larceny; the same year, he was arrested for possession of a controlled substance and credit card fraud. after moving to california in 1979, defendant was convicted of misdemeanor possession of a syringe; in 1980, he received 12 months of probation for a petty theft conviction; in 1985, he received 24 months of probation for possession of a syringe; in 1987, he was convicted of a health and safety code section 6 11350, subdivision (a) violation and received three years formal probation and 239 days in jail. in 1988, defendant was convicted of a health and safety code section 11351 violation, and was sentenced to two years in prison concurrent with his sentence for his 1987 conviction. in 1989, defendant was in violation of his parole for violations of health and safety code section 11377 and business and professions code section 4149. in april 1989, defendant was arrested by bart police and convicted of a health and safety code section 11550 violation. in march 1990, san francisco police arrested defendant for assault, resulting in a parole violation and reincarceration. after defendant was released in may 1991, in 1992, defendant was arrested twice in oakland for violations of penal code sections 273.5, subdivision (a) and 211, but charges were not filed. in october 1993, defendant was arrested for a violation of health and safety code section 11350, and convicted of violating business and professions code section 4149, for which he received 12 months of summary probation and 30 days in jail. in 1994, defendant committed the rape resulting in his five strike priors conviction of 1996, receiving a sentence of 35 years; the sentence was recalculated to 17 years in 1999. defendant was paroled in 2003. in march 2005, defendant was arrested on a parole violation, and was sentenced to eight months in prison, but after an appeal, the charge was dismissed. in used cocaine, and parole was continued. in june 2006, defendant was arrested on a september 8, 2007. defendant raped and beat the victim jennifer g. in long beach at his apartment. jennifer g. met defendant in front of a thrift shop, where defendant was working on some bicycles. defendant offered to buy her a beer, and they went to a liquor store. the victim h and smoked some crack. defendant attacked her, licking her face, buttocks, and vagina, and 7 forced his penis into her vagina; he also forced her to orally copulate him. during the assault, defendant hit her numerous times, and hit her with a crate, tools and his fists. he after the attack, jennifer g. had two black eyes, abrasions, and cuts and bruises all over her body. defendant made a romero, supra, 13 cal.4th 497 motion, requesting the court to dismiss his five prior strike convictions. he argued that pursuant to in re saldana (1997) 57 cal.app.4th 620, even where a defendant has an extensive record, the minor and nonaggravating nature of the current offense was a powerful factor that supported dismissal of the strike priors. defendant pointed out that as charged, he faced 10 years without the strike priors, and such a sentence would certainly serve justice in light of the nature of the current offenses and the fact he was 62 years old; in addition, the prior strikes were all based on the same incident and involved the same victim, and were out of character for him considering his other convictions for drug offenses and larceny. since his parole in 2003, he was not found to be in violation, and after his discharge from parole in september 2007 until the current offense, he has not been charged with a crime. no question that the current offense is not a serious or violent felony and is . . . in terms of the severity of the offense, is on the lighter side. [] . . . [] . . . i case i believe there would be four years of enhancements on top of that, is a significant sentence for of people v .williams (1997) 17 cal.4th 148, 161, finding that the nature of the current offense was the strongest factor in favor of defendant. however, with the respect to court has difficulty. the strikes we are talking about have to do with a 1994 arrest for rape, oral copulation, and other sexual-which he was convicted, each of which is itself a strike. the 1994 arrest was over a two- 8 day period with a series of events that are very serious and troubling in nature concerning strong, supra, 87 cal.app.4th 328, a third appellate district case, and gaston, supra, 74 cal.app.4th 310, defendant had been convicted of 10 felonies and numerous misdemeanors; in 1987 and 1988 defendant had further drug convictions; in 1990 he violated his parole with an assault; in 1993 he suffered another drug conviction; the rape occurred in 1994, and defendant was paroled years passed between the time when [defendant] was released from custody in the strike date of the strikes in this case, and then from this date until this charge, mr. carter has been . . . court recognized defendant had a substance abuse problem, but noted that in addition to tthe three-strikes law is to ensure a longer sentence for people who are repeat offenders in this revolving door type of situation, and mr. carter is exactly in that situation. [] my concern is that if he were sentenced and the court were to strike the strikesand i would -strike case, and then he serves ten years. i have every reason treleased, given his history, he will continue to commit crimes, whether they are theft-related, drug- e would be quite old by the time 9 nario it is difficult, but i think not supported by the defendant testified to his criminal history and his upbringing. defendant admitted that the first time he went to prison was in 1965 when he was 15 years old for stealing a and when he was released he was 17 years old. he asserted his other cases were related to drugs and possession of paraphernalia, and that his burglary charge was based on looting during a riot. further, the 1994 rape was his only violent crime. defendant detailed the difficuauthorities listed the victim in his rape case as being under the age of 14; as a result defendant had a difficult time in prison and upon his release. the court responded that nonetheless, given the nature of the original offense, the lengthy criminal record, the fact that the crime is also tied to drug use, the court has every reason to believe that when mr. carter is released and he goes back to drug use another violent offense could occur. [] so for those reasons and the reasons i set forth earlier, the finding of the court is that the romero[, supra, 13 cal.4th 497] b. striking of prior strikes and greater punishment for those who commit a felony and have been previously 667, subd. (b).) a trial court may exercise its discretion to strike a prior conviction in furtherance of justice. ( 1385, subd. (a); romero, supra, 13 cal.4th at pp. 529530; people v. williams, supra, 17 cal.4th at pp. 151felony conviction allegation or finding under the three strikes law . . . or in reviewing such a ruling, the court . . . must consider whether, in light of the nature and 10 circumstances of his present felonies and prior serious and/or violent felony convictions, the particulars of his background, character, and prospects, the defendant may be deemed outside the [three strikes] treated as though he had not previously been convicted of one or more serious and/or people v. williams, supra, 17 cal.4th at p. 161.) both the rights of the defendant and the interests of society must be considered when determining whether to strike a prior strike. (id. at pp. 158161.) the court must consider all relevant factors. focusing on a single factor, such as the nature of the current conviction, to the exclusion of other factors, is error. (people v. carmony (2004) 33 cal.4th 367, 379.) factors relevant to the nature of the prior strikes include their remoteness in time (strong, supra, 87 cal.app.4th at pp. 338340), whether the prior offenses involved violence or the use of a weapon (people v. myers (1999) 69 cal.app.4th 305, 308310), whether multiple convictions arose out of the same act (people v. benson (people v. romero (2002) 99 cal.app.4th 1418, 1434), the increasing or decreasing strong, at p. he or she has taken steps to ameliorate it (gaston, supra, 74 cal.app.4th at p. 322), whether the new offense is the same as prior offenses (strong, supra, 87 cal.app.4th at p. background, character, and prospects (people v. williams, supra, 17 cal.4th at p. 161; people v. bishop (1997) 56 cal.app.4th 1245, 1251). extraordinary exercise of discretion, and is very much like setting aside a judgment of people v. mcglothin (1998) 67 cal.app.4th 468, because, for articulable reasons which can withstand scrutiny for abuse, this defendant should be treated as though he actually fell outside the ibid.) 11 people v. garcia (1999) 20 cal.4th 490, 503; romero, supra, 13 cal.4th at p. 530.) in gaston, supra, 74 cal.app.4th 310, the defendant had an extensive criminal career, including two crimes classified as serious felonies, as well as a dozen other felonies; he had been in prison on multiple separate occasions, in addition to his return to prison for violation of parole; and he had been in county jail during a good portion of the when he was convicted of grand theft; in 1974, he was convicted of grand theft auto and assault with a deadly weapon (two different incidents); in 1976, he was convicted of receiving stolen property; in 1977, convicted of three separate offenses (grand theft, grand theft auto, and driving under the influence); in 1978, convicted of grand theft; and in 1981, the defendant was convicted of the strike offenses, kidnapping and robbery. in 1990, defendant was paroled, and the same year was convicted of joyriding; in 1991, he was convicted of burglary, and in 1994, following release from prison, he was convicted of joyriding; in 1996, he suffered another conviction for joyriding, and in 1998, the present case, he was convicted again of joyriding. (id. at p. 317.) the defendant was on parole when he committed the crime at issue, a violation of vehicle code section 10851 (unlawful driving or taking of a vehicle). (gaston, supra, 74 priors, an armed robbery occurring more than 10 years prior. the trial court relied on the nonserious nature of the present crime, recognizing it was a felony, the absence of the use id. at p. 314.) in gaston, division four of this district held the trial court abused its discretion in striking the strike, based on while on parole or probation from previous felony convictions. as we observed from the outset, he is the kind of revolving-door career criminal for whom the three strikes law id. at number of breaks and has benefited from none of them. . . . what comes through most 12 prominently from a review of all of the circumstances is that he has committed an unending series of felonies, as well as other crimes, has been repeatedly punished for these crimes, including the service of four prior prison terms, and has failed to learn anything from the experience. [] accordingly, [defendant] cannot reasonably be said to id. at p. 322.) similarly, in strong, supra, 87 cal.app.4th 328, upon which the trial court relied, the defendant had a 22-year criminal record, including six felonies within the previous eight yeaunprovoked assault with a knife on a bystander occurring three years before the current offense, which was the sale of a substance falsely represented to be cocaine in violation of health and safety code section 11355. (strong, at p. 331.) the trial court struck the id. at p. 334.) reversing the trial court, the third appellate district found the three strikes law establishes a sentencing requirement to be applied in every case where the defendant has the scheme should be made . . . strikes initiative, as well as the legislative act embodying its terms, was intended to strong, supra, 87 cal.app.4th at pp. 337338.) applying this rationale, the court of appeal found the trial -year-old strike offense, for which he was currently on parole when the charged offense was committed, and all five rikes law was designed. (id. at p. 340.) on the other hand, in people v. saldana, supra, 57 cal.app.4th 620, a second appellate district case, on which defendant relies, the defendant was convicted in 1994 13 of one count of possession of a controlled substance, heroin, in violation of health and striking prior strikes for a 1977 residential burglary conviction and a 1981 robbery conviction on the basis that the current offense was relatively minor, the burglary conviction was 16 years old, the defendant was married with two children, and was older and less likely to commit crimes. (id. at pp. 623624.) saldana found that based upon the trial court did not abuse its discretion in striking the prior strike. (id. at pp. 626627.) here, we do not find the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to strike to the exercise of nonviolent nature of the current crime), and those factors weighing against defendant (his lengthy and continuous criminal record consisting of a pattern of drug and property crimes extending over a 40-year period, and the seriousness of the strike offenses themselves). putting all these factors together, as the trial court did here, and finding ook him outside of the spirit of the three strikes law, the defendant is more like the defendants in gaston, supra, 74 cal.app.4th 310 and strong, supra, 87 cal.app.4th 328 who were career criminals with lengthy histories and repeated episodes of crimes. in that respect, defendant is unlike the defendant in people v. saldana, supra, 57 cal.app.4th 620, whose serious felonies were remote in time, who did not have a lengthy record indicating he was a career criminal, and who had a stable home life. c. cruel and unusual punishment defendant argues that his sentence of 25 years to life is grossly disproportionate to the crime committed, and it offends fundamental notions of human dignity to sentence a senior citizen to prison for the rest of his life for the sale of 10 pills prescribed to him. although defendant did not raise this issue in the trial court, we consider it to forestall a 14 claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. (people v. dejesus (1995) 38 cal.app.4th 1, 27.) the eighth amendment to the feewing v. california (2003) 538 u.s. 11, 20 [123 s.ct. 1179, 155 l.ed.2d 108].) a proportionality analysis requires consideration of three objective criteria, which imposed on other criminals in the same jurisdiction; and (iii) the sentences imposed for commissiid. at p. 22, quoting solem v. helm courts should be reluctant to review legislatively mandated terms of imprisonment, and . . . successful challenges to the proportionality of particular sentences should be ibid. at p. 22; see also lockyer v. andrade (2003) 538 u.s. 63, 77 erves a the standard under the california constitution to determine whether a sentence is cruel or unusual is similar to the test under the eighth amendment of the federal constitution: a puniscrime for which it is inflicted that it shocks the conscience and offends fundamental in re lynch (1972) 8 cal.3d 410, 424.) we look at the nature of the offense and the offender as well as compare the punishments imposed within california for more serious offenses and in other jurisdictions for similar offenses. (id. at pp. 425428; see also people v. martinez (1999) 71 cal.app.4th 1502, 1510.) with respect to the nature of the offense and nature of the offender, courts may consider involvement and the consequences, as well as the facts of the offender, including his culpability, prior criminality and state of mind. (people v . dillon (1983) 34 cal.3d 441, 479.) 15 the life of one who repeatedly commits criminal offenses serious enough to be punished as felonies, to segregate that person from the rest of society for an extended period of offense but also on the propensities he has demonstrated over a period of time during rummel v. estelle (1980) 445 u.s. 263, 284 [100 s.ct. 1133, 63 l.ed.2d 382].) under the federal constitution, sentencing a three-time offender to a life sentence was not cruel and unusual punishment where the crimes included fraudulent use of a credit card, passing a forged check, and felony theft, which together totaled less than $300. (rummel, at pp. 265266.) under the california three strikes law ( 667, subds. (b)(i)), it was not cruel and unusual punishment to sentence a recidivist criminal to 25 years to life where the triggering offense was the theft of three golf clubs. (ewing v. california, supra, 538 u.s. at pp. 3031.) a term of 40 years for possession with intent to distribute and distribution of marijuana was not cruel and unusual punishment. (hutto v. davis (1982) 454 u.s. 370 [102 s.ct. 703, 70 l.ed.2d 556].) under the california constitution, the imposition of a 61-years-to-life term for an offender convicted of two counts of residential burglary with two prior convictions for the same offense was not cruel or unusual. (people v. ingram (1995) 40 cal.app.4th 1397, 14151416, disapproved on another ground in people v. dotson (1997) 16 cal.4th 547, 559, 560, fn. 8.) a sentence of 25 years to life for an ex-felon in possession of a handgun who had two prior robbery convictions was not cruel or unusual punishment. (people v. cooper (1996) 43 cal.app.4th 815, 828.) back to 1965 and has been continuous, primarily consisting of drug offenses and property crimes. at 62 years of age, defendant has shown no signs of slowing down his criminal behavior, and indeed the instant crime is one of the type of crimes defendant has committed numerous times over the course of exiling from society those individuals who have proved themselves to be threats to the 16 public safety and security. defepeople v. ingram, supra, 40 cal.app.4th at pp. 14151416.) ii. elevation of second strike case to 25 years to life defendant contends his due process rights were violated when his case, a presumptive second strike case, went to trial as at 25-years-to-life case without notice to him after he elected to go to trial. he contends he had no notice that if he rejected a pretrial offer, his only option would be to face a 25-years-to-life term. he requests that we reverse his sentence and that on remand, it must be reduced to no more than the maximum he would have received as a second strike offender. respondent contends defendant forfeited the issue for failing to raise it in the trial court, and in any event had notice his case would proceed as a third strike matter based on the information and amended information, which both alleged prior strikes; the second strike case policy was only a presumption; and the court at the various hearings early on stated the case was potentially a third strike case. a. factual background at the preliminary hearing held december 29, 2009, the trial court set bail at as a third strike case in these type[s] of cases. but for purposes of bail, nonetheless those at arraignment held january 12, 2010, defendant contends the prosecution offered offer with the belief that he could have all his strikes set aside given his age and the nature of the current offense.5 5 strike his prior strikes filed february 17, 2011. 17 during the period march 16, 2010 through june 23, 2010, at five pretrial hearings, according to defendant, the prosecution did not mention treating the case as a third strike case. according to his counsel, at some point during this pretrial period, the prosecution offered defendant a plea to the low term on count two, doubled to four years at 80 percent with an admission of a strike prior. defendant again rejected the offer and the matter was set for trial. defendant counter offered five years at 50 percent. on june 23, 2010, defendant announced he was ready for trial. the matter trailed to june 29, 2010, and the offers remained the same. according to defendant, the prosecution did not inform him that it would proceed under the three strikes law and seek a 25-years-to-life sentence. at the hearing, defendant informed the court his last assume this is a presumptive non-which the prosecution term of 16 years.6 the prosecution informed the court it was not inclined to strike the strike. the court noted that the offer was four years, and turned to defendant and asked, -defendant stated he wanted to go to trial. the court turned to trial setting and reiterated, -prosecution reiterated that its offer was four years with the strike and defendant countered with five years and no strike. the court informed defendant that the time he would be serving under either offer was not that much different: if he served four years with the strike that would entail, at 6 exposure was 16 years, and that defendant had rejected years with a strike. 18 85 percent, a three and half-year sentence. on other hand, he was facing a maximum sentence of 16 years. on july 1, 2010, the matter was sent to master calendar court for assignment to a trial court. at that time, moments before trial, defendant was informed that the prosecution would seek 25 years to life. defendant requested more time to prepare his case. the court continued the matter to august 4, 2010, and sent it back before judge klein. on august 4, 2010, defense counsel objected that he had not been informed until minutes before trial that the prosecution was proceeding as a three strikes case and s without strikes and that the court advised if this is what happened or notthat maybe he can get sent to another court and get a defense counsel advised the court that was not his tactibecause the people are proceeding on a life case for sales of vicodin, which is not the of time and exposure that [defendant] is facing than we were before we left. [] . . . [] going to engagthink both sides know my sentencing practices. i also thinkif you sure. . . . [] so if mr. carter wants to do that, fine. but what i know about this case, 19 romero[, supra, 13 cal.4th 497] defendant requested and was granted additional time to prepare. on january 20, 2011, the matter proceeded to trial. the court stated that it had spoken to counsel in chambers and the last offer from the prosecution was 25 years to moments ago. he indicated to me he has absolutely no desire to go forward with the jury trial. he wants to plead on this matter. i explained to him that at this point there is no offer to actually plead to, but i did want to express his desire to the court and let the court know that he has no desire to go guess the real question iswell, there are two things. first of all, a defendant always has always do. the question is whether you would get an indicated sentence from the court in prosecution reiterated that the last offer was 25 years to life. defendant maintained in his mprior felony convictions, the case was presumed to be a second strike case if none of the charged offenses was a serious or violent felony. such presumption could be rebutted if the current case involved the use of a firearm or deadly weapon, injury to a victim, or a threat of vias a third strike case was vindictive. at the sentencing, the prosecution clarified why it was proceeding with a third-there for the purposes of this sentencing and that, you know, our internal procedures have 20 been followed in this case to the extat this later. [] my understanding, in a nutshell, is that once the case was reviewed by case, became aware through the acquisition of the d.a. file which had numerous b. discussion g as the prosecutor has probable cause to believe that the accused committed an offense defined by statute, the decision whether or not to prosecute, and (bordenkircher v. hayes (1978) 434 u.s. 357, 364 [98 s.ct. 663, 54 l.ed.2d 604] (bordenkircher).) as explained in wayte v. united states (1985) 470 u.s. 598, 607608 that the decision to prosecute is particularly ill-suited to judicial review. such factors as ll enforcement plan are not readily susceptible to the kind of analysis the courts are competent to undertake. judicial supervision in this area, moreover, entails systemic costs of particular concern. examining the basis of a prosecution delays the criminal decisionmaking to outside inquiry, and may undermine prosecutorial effectiveness by cerns that although prosecutorial discretion is broad, it is not unfettered. indeed, . . subject to constitutional counited states v. batchelder (1979) 442 u.s. 114, 124125 [99 s.ct. 2198, 60 l.ed.2d 755].) the decision to prosecute may not be deliberately based upon an unjustifiable standard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary classification, including the 21 exercise of protected statutory and constitutional rights. (wayte v. united states, supra, 470 u.s. at p. 608.) a denial of due process in the form of a vindictive or retaliatory prosecution occurs when a charging decision is motivated by a desire to punish the defendant for doing something the law allows him to do. (united states v. goodwin (1982) 457 u.s. 368, 372 [102 s.ct. 2485, 73 l.ed.2d 74] (goodwin); people v. bracey (1994) 21 cal.app.4th 1532, 1549.) as motives are difficult to prove, the united states supreme court found it necessary to presume a vindictive motive in certain cases where action adverse to the defendant has been taken after the defendant exercised a legal right. (goodwin, at p. 373.) the presumption applies, however, only where a reasonable likelihood of vindictiveness exists, since applying the presumption may thwart a legitimate response to criminal conduct. (idtunity for ibid.) before trial commences, i.e., before jeopardy attaches, no presumption of vindictiveness applies, even where there is some appearance of vindictiveness. (goodwin, at p. 384; people v. michaels (2002) 28 cal.4th 486, 515; people v. edwards (1991) 54 cal.3d 787, 828 [jeopardy is an important factor in determining vindictiveness].) before trial, the defendant must show with objective evidence that the stateupon improper considerations. (bracey, at p. 1549.) people v. johnson (1991) 233 cal.app.3d 425, 447.) the prosecution must then demonstrate an objective change of circumstance justifying the charging or sentencing decision and must show the new information could not have reasonably been discovered when the prosecutor filed the original charges. (people v. bracey, supra, 21 cal.app.4th at p. 1545.) in twiggs v. superior court (1983) 34 cal.3d 360 (twiggs), after the jury was unable to reach a verdict, the prosecution offered the defendant a plea agreement. (id. at 22 p. 364.) after the defendant rejected the offer and exercised his right to a jury trial, the prosecutor was permitted to amend the information to charge five additional prior felony convictions as enhancements. (id. at pp. 364365.) the twiggs court reasonsame considerations that led the high court to condemn such prosecutorial conduct in the context of a postconviction appeal are applicable when the defendant asserts his right to a retrial after a mistrial. as a prosecutor would have a considerable stake in discouraging appeals requiring trials de novo, so too would the prosecution in a case such as this have a prosecution was unable to obtain a convictid. at p. 369.) the court made an initial showing id. at p. 371.) twiggs, supra, 34 cal.3d 360 distinguished bordenkircher, supra, 434 u.s. 357 in which the prosecutor told the defendant during plea negotiations that, if he did not plead guilty and accept the five-year offer, the prosecution would seek an indictment under the imprisonment. (bordenkircher, at pp. 358359.) in bordenkircher, the united states supreme court held thadue process by openly presenting him with the disagreeable choice of accepting the plea or facing charges on which he was clearly subject to prosecution. (id. at p. 365.) twiggs stated that bordenkircher presented in a case such as this, where the record suggests that the more serious charges -and-circumstances strongly suggest that the prosecutor unilaterally imposed a penalty in twiggs, at p. 371.) the twiggs court found a presumption of vindictiveness, and found its reasoning consistent shows that the prosecution has increased the charges in apparent response to the 23 ng of ibid.) twiggs applied this rule to the case convictions until the defendant insisted on a retrial, circumstances that plainly gave rise to id. at p. 372.) here, unlike twiggs, supra, 34 cal.3d 360, where the prosecution amended the information to add five additional prior felony convictions as enhancements after the defendant repriors were charged in the information. thus, defendant cannot establish a presumption of vindictiveness because the matter was always a three strikes case. the prosecuti-strikes case does not raise a presumption of vindictiveness because that a presumption arises only where there is ves.
