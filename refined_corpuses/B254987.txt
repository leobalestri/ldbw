(see people v. wende (1979) 25 cal.3d 436, 441 (wende).) following people v. serrano (2012) 211 cal.app.4th 496, 503, review den. mar. 13, 2013 (serranoconstitutional protections of a first appeal of right, including the right to wende review where appropriate, . . . he is not entitled to anders [v. california (1967) 386 u.s. 738]/wende the requirements set forth in serrano and brown has not filed a supplemental brief with this court, we dismiss the appeal as abandoned. factual and procedural background on december 12, 2001, the district attorney of the county of los angeles filed an information alleging that brown used a knife to assault a public transit passenger on or about november 10, 2001. the information charged brown with one count of assault with a deadly weapon on a transportation passenger (pen. code,  245.21). the information further alleged that brown suffered three prior convictions pursuant to sections 667, subdivisions (a)(1) and (b)-(i), and 1170.12, subdivisions (a)-(d), and four prior convictions pursuant to section 667.5, subdivision (b). brown pleaded guilty to the assault count ( 245.2) on january 15, 2002. brown also admitted one ( 1170.12, subds. (a)-(d)) and three other prior convictions. ( 667, subd. (a)). the trial court sentenced brown to a low term of three years on the assault count, as well as an additional three years pursuant to section 1170.12, subdivisions (a)-(d). the court added an additional five years for each of the 1 all further statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise indicated. 3 three convictions that brown admitted pursuant to section 667, subdivision (a), bringing ntence to 21 years. the court credited brown with 81 days in custody, consisting of 70 days of actual custody and 11 days of good time credit. 2 there is no indication in the record that brown exercised his right to appeal, and the time for doing so has long passed. in february 2014, twelve years into his sentence, brown, acting in propia persona, petition for modification of sentence to comply with prison population reduction order on plata v. brown brown contended that ongoing federal litigation addressing prison overcrowding set a deadline of december 31, 2013, for the state to reduce its prison population to no more than 137.5 percent of design capacity (see coleman v. brown, supra, 952 f.supp.2d at p. 904); that the state failed to comply with proceeding by which it may determine if brown is the sort of inmate who may be on february is no substantial right the defeis pursuant to an agreed upon disposition between the defense and the brown timely filed a notice of appeal on march 14, 2014. counsel appointed to represent brown on appeal reviewed the record, filed an opening brief which raised no issues, and requested this court to conduct an independent review of the record. (see wende, supra, 25 cal.3d at p. 441.) we directed counsel to send the record on appeal and a copy of the opening brief to brown. we also letter any grounds of appeal, contentions, or argument which appellant wishes this court we received no response. after we discovered an irregularity in the 2 conduct credits to 15 percent. to section 1237.1. 4 address of the june 30, 2014, notice,3 we sent a second notice on september 30, 2014. to date, we have received no response. discussion -issue brief and requested that this court wende. the wende l constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel in the first appeal of right from their convictions. (people v. kelly (2006) 40 cal.4th 106, 118; see also serrano, supra, 211 cal.app.4th at p. 500; wende, supra, 25 cal.3d at pp. 441-442.) our supreme court and, ultimately, the united states supreme court (see smith v. robbins (2000) 528 u.s. 259, 276) determined that the wende requirement that the appellate court undertake a complete review of the record when counsel is unable to identify any arguable issue on appeal adequately implements the mandates of anders v. california (1967) 386 u.s. 738, 3 documents in the record, including the information, felony complaint, and abstract of 1979. this later date is two years after one of the prior convictions to which brown admitted. (it also is only a few years before the others.) the inconsistency appears to have been unnoticed, or at the very least disregarded, by brown, counsel, and the court below. by remarkable coincidence, there is another department of corrections and rehabilitation inmate named robert lee brown who is thirty years younger than appellant brown and may well have a birth date of august 6, 1979. that robert lee brown has a different inmate identification number than appellant brown and is housed at a different facility. the notice that we sent to brown on june 30, 2014, was addressed to roblee brown may have received this improperly directed notice. to ensure that appellant brown received the notice and had a full and fair opportunity to file a supplemental brief, and identification number, and re-sent the notice on september 30, 2014. 5 in first appeals of right. (serrano, supra, 211 cal.app.4th at p. 500; people v. kelly, supra, 40 cal.4th at p. 119.) eme court and the california supreme court have concluded that due process does not require anders/wende review other than in the first (serrano, supra, 211 cal.app.4th at p. 500, citing pennsylvania v. finley (1987) 481 u.s. 551, 555 (finley), and in re conservatorship of ben c. (2007) 40 cal.4th 529, 536-537 (ben c.).) in finley, the united states supreme court ruled that the federal counsel extends to the first appeal of ri (finley, supra, 481 u.s. at p. 555.) (id. at p. 556.) and since anders (and wende) primarily are concerned with ensuring the right to effective counsel, constitutional right to insist on the anders procedures which were designed solely to protect that (id. at p. 557.) the california supreme court has relied on finley anders (people v. kelly, supra, 40 cal.4th at p. 119.) for instance, the court has clarified that the protections afforded by anders and wende decisions affecting child custody or parental status (in re sade c. (1996) 13 cal.4th 952, 959), ben c., supra, 40 cal.4th at p. 537). the instant case is not a first appeal of right. criminal context, [it] is not a first appeal of right from a criminal prosecution, because it (serrano, supra, 211 cal.app.4th at p. 501.) in an appeal from a postconviction motion to vacate judgment, that right is a state created (ibid.; see also finley, supra, 481 u.s. at pp. 555-556.) 6 and because brown lacks a federal constitutional right to counsel for his similarly aimed modification of sentence to comply with prison population reduction order on plata v. brownanders/wende review when appointed (serrano, supra, 211 cal.app.4th at p. 501.) thus, after his appointed counsel failed to discern any arguable issues, she was (ben c., supra, 40 cal.4th at p. 544; serrano, supra, 211 cal.app.4th at p. 503.) receipt of the brief from counsel, the court will inform defendant of his right to file a supplemental brief. the court will then either retain the appeal or dismiss it on our own (serrano, supra, 211 cal.app.4th at p. 503; see also ben c., supra, 40 cal.4th ].) here, as in serrano, the wende brief filed by counsel fulfills her obligations. (see serrano, supra, 211 cal.app.4th at p. 503.) brown did not file anything with the court after being informed of his right to do so. accordingly, we exercise our discretion to dismiss the appeal as abandoned. (id. at p. 504.) 7 disposition the appeal is dismissed as abandoned. not to be published in the official reports collins, j. epstein, p. j. willhite, j.
