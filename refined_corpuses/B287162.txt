(people v. perez (2018) 19 cal.app.5th 818, 830-831 (perez); people v. ogunmowo (2018) 23 cal.app.5th 67, 75.) an attorney provides constitutionally ineffective assistance if (1) his representation is deficient, and (2) prejudice flows from that deficient representation. (strickland v. washington (1984) 466 u.s. 668, 688, 692 (strickland).) as the moving party, defendant bears the burden of establishing the ineffective assistance of counsel necessary to invalidate her conviction by a preponderance of the evidence ( 1473.7, subd. (e)(1)), and we independently review whether the defendant has carried this 5 burden (ogunmowo, at p. 76; people v. olvera (2018) 24 cal.app.5th 1112, 1116 (olvera)). constitutionally ineffective because (1) he failed to research and advise her regarding the immigration consequences of her plea and sentence, (2) he gave her incorrect advice about those consequences, and (3) he did not negotiate an immigration-safe disposition. as to each of these grounds, defendant has failed to establish either deficient performance or prejudice, or both. i. deficient performance a. failure to research and provide advice regarding immigration consequences although defense counsel now have an affirmative duty to investigate and correctly advise a criminal defendant regarding the immigration consequences of a plea (and thus could be deemed constitutionally ineffective for failing to discharge that duty) (padilla v. kentucky (2010) 559 u.s. 356, 360 (padilla)), no such duty existed at the time defendant entered her pleas in 2008. back then, defense counsel had a more limited duty not to misadvise a defendant regarding the immigration consequences of a plea. (in re resendiz (2001) 25 cal.4th 230, 247, abrogated in part on other grounds in padilla, at p. 370; people v. soriano (1987) 194 cal.app.3d 1470, 1481-1482 (soriano).) thus, deficient because he did not affirmatively research and advise her about the immigration consequences of her plea and sentence lacks a basis in the law applicable at the time of her pleas. defendant offers two reasons why her attorney was required, even in 2008, to investigate and advise her regarding the immigration consequences of her plea. first, she cites the padilla, supra, 6 559 u.s. 356. but padilla was not decided until 2010, and the supreme court subsequently held that padillasixth amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel does not apply retroactively to defendants whose convictions were final when padilla was decided. (chaidez v. united states (2013) 568 u.s. 342, 344, 357-358.) second, defendant cites soriano, supra, 194 cal.app.3d 1470 and people v. barocio (1989) 216 cal.app.3d 99 (barocio) as authority for the proposition that california courts recognized a duty to research and advise criminal defendants regarding immigration consequences back in 2008. to be sure, soriano and barocio soriano mak[ing] it her business to discover what impact [the is immigration consequences of his plea (soriano, at pp. 1480, 1482), and barocio noted that soriano[c] . . . research the specific (barocio, at p. 107). but sorianos language sweeps beyond its holding, which is that a defense attorney engages in deficient that a negotiated sentence may have immigration consequences (soriano, at pp. 1480-1482.) thus, sorianos holding merely reaffirms the general rule at the time that misadvisement regarding immigration consequences constitutes deficient performance, as barocio itself noted. (barocio, at p. 107 soriano can be limited to its facts, i.e., a 7 situation where the defendant may have been misinformed of the to sorianos dicta, which makes soriano an outlier among the pre-padilla case law. (in re resendiz, supra, 25 cal.4th at p. 247 investigate or provide advice regarding the immigration consequences that would flow from the probationary sentence defendant actually received, his failure to do so was not deficient performance. b. misadvisement as explained above, defense counsel was obligated, even in 2008, not to misadvise a defendant about the immigration consequences of her plea and sentence. (in re resendiz, supra, 25 cal.4th at p. 247; soriano, supra, 194 cal.app.3d at p. 1482.) defendant denies getting any immigration advice, so if her declaration and testimony are credited, there could be no instead, there was still no misadvisement because he provided her no advice regarding the probationary sentence the trial court actually imposed; instead, he merely told her that there was a a jailed for her drug crimes. statement constitutes bad advice for two reasons: (1) because the attorneya deportation is akin to the formulaic advice of possible deportation condemned in soriano, and (2) the attorney once referred to these 8 conspeople v. bautista (2004) 115 cal.app.4th 229, 240 (bautista) assumed that deportation is not a consequence of a drug transportation plea, even one where jail time is imposed. neither argument has merit. the formulaic advice regarding possible deportation in soriano constituted a misadvisement because deportation for the crime imposed was mandatory, rendering the formulaic advice legally incorrect. defendant has not shown that her attorney was incorrect in telling her that deportation was likely (or highly likely) if she were convicted of possession for sale and sentenced to jail or prison; nor has she shown any misadvisement regarding the deportation consequences for the non-jail sentence that was acdefendant was never charged with transporting drugs, and her attorney elsewhere in his testimony referred to the charged crimes. c. failure to negotiate an immigration-safe disposition several cases decided prior to 2008 recognized a duty on the part of defense counsel to investigate, [to] advise,to try to negotiate an immigration-safe disposition, at least where a defendant makes her concerns about possible immigration consequences known to counsel. (bautista, supra, 115 cal.app.4th at p. 242; barocio, supra, 216 cal.app.3d at pp. 102, the defendant that he could ask the trial court for a attorney testified that he sought to avoid the near-certain charges by negotiating a plea involving no jail time, but he 9 admitted that he did not investigate the immigration consequences flowing from the probationary sentence actually imposed and thus did not try to negotiate a disposition with even fewer possible immigration consequences. on these facts, we will assume for the sak representation was deficient for not doing so. ii. prejudice ineffective assistance of counsel warranting relief only if it prejudiced the defendant. (strickland, supra, 466 u.s. at pp. 688, 692.) in the context of a plea, deficient representation is prejudicial only if reasonable probabilitypleaded guilty and wou(lee v. united states (2017) 137 s.ct. 1958, 1969, quoting hill v. lockhart (1985) 474 u.s. 52, 59; accord, people v. martinez (2013) 57 cal.4th 555, 564 defendant would have done, not what the effect of that decision have still entered a plea, we must look to contemporaneous srather than rely on her more self-post hoc assertions . . . about how [she] would have pleaded but for [her] .lee, at p. 1967.) in fact, the post hoc assertions are insufficient by themselves to overturn a plea. (ibid.) defendant has not carried her burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, that she was prejudiced by any of the three types of deficient performance she alleges. 10 although defendant in her 2017 declaration and testimony says that she would not have pled guilty had she known her pleas exposed her to a risk of deportation, her actions contemporaneous with her 2008 plea belie her current statements: the trial court specifically told defendant that, if she were not a united states citizen, her plea will result in deportation,consequences does not foreclose a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel (in re resendiz, supra, 25 cal.4th at pp. 241-242), in this case notwithstanding the her plea will result in her deportation is powerful evidence that she would still have pled guilty even if she had possessed more specific knowledge about immigration consequences that she now claims she lacked. (olvera, supra, 24 cal.app.5th at pp. 1116-1117 [so noting]; perez, supra, 19 cal.app.5th at p. 829 [same].) failure to negotiate a more immigration-safe disposition was prejudicial. such a failure is prejudicial only if a defendant -neutral disposition to which the prosecutolvera, supra, 24 cal.app.5th at p. 1118; perez, supra, 19 cal.app.4th at pp. 830-831; in re resendiz, supra, 25 cal.4th at pp. 253-254.) defendant drug transportatcharge under section 32 but has provided no evidence that these charges fit the actual facts of her crimes or that a prosecutor would be reasonably likely to agree to her suggested charges. 11 disposition the order is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. ______________________, j. hoffstadt we concur: _________________________, p. j. lui _________________________, j. ashmann-gerst
