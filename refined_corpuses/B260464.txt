(a)). defendant was sentenced under the three strikeslaw to a term of 25 years to life because he was also found to have convictions ( 667, 1170.12). 1 the abstract of judgment in the prior case (case number a634965) states that in 1986, defendant was convicted of, inter alia, attempted forcible rape pursuant to section 664 and former section 261(2) (now renumbered as section 261, subdivision (a)(2) (people v. iniguez (1994) 7 cal.4th 847, 856, fn. 4)). 2 because this appeal is from the denial of a statutory, post-judgment motion, we do not include a statement of facts regarding count for which the defendant was convicted. 3 on february 28, 2014, following the november, 2012, passage of proposition 36, defendant filed a petition for recall of his three strikes sentence pursuant to section 1170.126.3 the trial court denied the petition on the grounds that defendant had a prior conviction for forcible rape that disqualified him from eligibility for recall and resentencing. following record correction proceedings, the trial court determined that the abstract of judgment in the prior case provided that defendant did not have a prior conviction for rape, but had prior convictions for, inter alia, attempted rape and assault with intent to commit rape. defendant filed a timely notice of appeal of the order denying his petition for recall of sentence. discussion defendant contends that there were numerous errors in the present case, in which case he was convicted in 1997, and in his prior case. . . . that occurred on we therefore do not addpurported errors that occurred in the trial of and sentencing in the present and prior cases. defendant also contends that the trial court erred in denying his petition for recall of sentence because the trial court relied on a prior conviction (for forcible rape) which defendant did not suffer. an appealed judgment or order correct on any theory will be affirmed, however, even when the trial courts reasoning may have been erroneous.
