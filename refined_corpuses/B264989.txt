(pen. code,  211.)1 he was sentenced to a prison term.2 on april 9, 2015, echeverria, acting in propria persona, filed a petition for dismissal pursuant to section 1203.41 in the trial court. on may 15, 2015, the trial court held a hearing on the petition. counsel was appointed for echeverria. echeverria was not present. defense counsel stated that echeve dismissal, finding echeverria was ineligible for relief because of the state prison commitment. echeverria filed a timely notice of appeal. on june 19, 2015, he requested a certificate of probable cause to challenge the validity of the 1993 plea, which was denied as untimely and lacking any factual and legal basis. appended to the notice of appeal or to the request for a certificate of probable cause was challenged the validity of the plea based on, inter alia, s statements at the pre- . 1 all further undesignated statutory references are to the penal code. 2 the record before us does not contain an abstract of judgment or any documents relating to the underlying crime or sentencing. however, in his petition echeverria states he was convicted of second degree robbery. in his request for a certificate of probable cause and a typewritten statement, he states he pleaded to the crime, and his counsel confirmed this at the hearing below. although the record does not contain any documents showing echeverria was sentenced to prison, he does not dispute this fact. 3 discussion after review of the -appointed counsel filed an opening brief which raised no issues, and requested this court to conduct an independent review of the record pursuant to people v. wende (1979) 25 cal.3d 436, 441. on october 28, 2015, we advised appellant that he had 30 days to submit by brief or letter any contentions or argument he wished this court to consider. echeverria thereafter submitted a letter, in which he makes several complaints about the conduct of the preliminary hearing. first, the trial court refused to allow the defense to call a witness whose testimony would have contradicted the and the information in the police report, thereby infringing upon right to a fair trial. second, the victim was not credible, and the police report was suspect due to third, the people failed to establish where the weapon was recovered, and therefore it should have been excluded. for several reasons. he pleaded guilty to the offense, and cannot challenge the plea without a certificate of probable cause. a criminal defendant who appeals following a plea of no contest or guilty without a certificate of probable cause can only challenge the denial of a motion to suppress evidence or raise grounds arising after the entry of the ps validity.
