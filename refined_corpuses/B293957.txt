(a)(1); counts 1 & 2),1 assault by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury ( 245, subd. (a)(4); counts 3 & 4), and robbery ( 211; count 5). it was further alleged with respect to counts 3, 4, and 5 that defendant used a deadly weapon (a bb gun) within the meaning of section 1192.7, subdivision (c)(23), and with respect to count 1 that he inflicted great bodily injury within the meaning of section 12022.7. defendant pled no contest to counts 1 and 2 and admitted, with respect to count 1, that he had inflicted great bodily injury within the meaning of section 12022.7. the remaining counts were dismissed. defendant was sentenced to seven years in state prison. the trial court imposed a $300 restitution fine, a $60 criminal conviction assessment, and an $80 court operation fine. defendant timely appealed. his sole argument on appeal is that, pursuant to people v. dueas (2019) 30 cal.app.5th 1157, 11631173 (dueas), the trial court erred in imposing the criminal conviction assessment (gov. code,  70373), the court operations assessment ( 1465.8), and the restitution fine ( 1202.4) without first determining that defendant is able to pay we affirm. 1 all further statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise indicated. 3 discussion as defendant concedes in his opening brief, he did not object to the assessments or fines in the trial court. thus, he has forfeited his claim on appeal. even before dueasncrease[ed] the applicable here. ( 1202.4, subds. (b)(1), (c).) defendant did not object or otherwise present any evidence regarding his ability to pay to the trial court at sentencing. as a result, the issue has been forfeited on appeal. (see, e.g., people v. gibson (1994) 27 cal.app.4th 1466, 14681469; people v. bipialaka (2019) 34 cal.app.5th 455, 464 [by failing to object to fees or fines in the trial court, the defendant forfeited his objection on appeal]; people v. frandsen (2019) 33 cal.app.5th 1126, 11531155.) objection would have been futile. provisions mandate the assessments be imposed, nothing in the record of the sentencing hearing indicates that [defendant] was foreclosed from making the same request that the defendant in dueas made in the face of those same mandatory assessments. [defendant] plainly could have made a record had his ability to pay actually been an issue. indeed, [defendant] was obligated to create a record showing his inability to pay the maximum restitution fine, which would have served to also address his people v. frandsen, supra, 33 cal.app.5th at p. 1154.) description of dueas the law . . . .people v. frandsen, supra, 33 cal.app.5th at p. 1154.) dueas id. at p. 1154.) 4 argument fails on the merits. based on the constitutional guarantees of due process and ban against excessive fines, dueas held that trial courts may not impose three of the standard criminal assessments and finesnamely, the $30 court operations assessment ( 1465.8), the $40 criminal conviction assessment (gov. code,  70373), and the $300 restitution fine ( 1202.4)dueas, supra, 30 cal.app.5th at pp. 1164, 1171, fn. 8.) we need not decide whether we agree with dueas because defendant is not entitled to a remand even if we accept dueas. that is because the record in this case, unlike the record in dueas, indicates that defendant has the ability to pay the assessments and fines imposed in this case. people v. hennessey (1995) 37 cal.app.4th 1830, 1837; people v. gentry (1994) 28 cal.app.4th 1374, 1376.) prisoners earn wages ranging from $12 per month (for the lowest skilled jobs) to $56 per month (for the highest). (cal. dept. of corrections & rehabilitation, operations manual,  51120.6, 51121.10 (2019).) at these rates, -year sentence, he will have enough to pay the assessments and fines.2 2 even if defendant does not voluntarily use his wages to pay the amounts due, the state may garnish between 20 and 50 percent of those wages to pay the restitution fine. ( 2085.5, subds. (a) & (c); people v. ellis (2019) 31 cal.app.5th 1090, 1094.) 5 it follows that wrestitution fine must be stayed unless and until the people prove he has a present ability to pay.3 disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. _______________________, acting p. j. ashmann-gerst we concur: ________________________, j. chavez ________________________, j. hoffstadt 3 in so concluding, we note that defendant evidence in the record supporting his [present or future] inability to pay. (people v. gamache (2010) 48 cal.4th 347, 409.) and, defendant offers no legal authority in support of his suggestion that because he was represented by appointed counsel at trial, he necessarily cannot afford to pay the court-ordered fines. in fact, the law holds otherwise. (see, e.g., people v. douglas (1995) 39 the costs of court-
