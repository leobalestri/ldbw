(a)(1)) for striking duran with the tire iron. the people further alleged that defendant personally inflicted great bodily injury as to the counts for punching and kicking duran ( 12022.7, subd. (a)). the people also alleged that under our three strikes law ( 667, subds. (b)-(j) & 1170.12, subds. (a)-subd. (a)(1)), and a prior prison term ( 667.5, subd. (b)). the people also alleged four additional prior prison terms. the matter proceeded to trial. defendant and his daughter testified that duran had been armed with a knife, and that she and her brother had been the aggressors. the trial court instructed the jury on the charged offenses, on simple assault as 4 a lesser included offense to all of the assault charges, on battery as a lesser included offense to mayhem, and on self-defense. the jury found defendant guilty of mayhem, of assault by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury as to the punch and kick to duran, and simple assault as to the remaining two assault counts. the jury found true the allegations that defendant personally inflicted great bodily injury. defendant subsequently admitted his prior convictions. the trial court sentenced defendant to 24 years in prison. the court imposed 24 years on the mayhem count, comprised of a base sentence of 16 years (eight years, doubled due to the prior strike), plus five years for the prior serious felony, plus three years for three of the five prior prison terms. the court stayed all of the remaining sentences under section 654. defendant filed this timely appeal. discussion defendant argues that his mayhem conviction must be overturned because there is insufficient evidence that he permanently injured duran. we review this claim by asking whether the recordviewed in the light most favorable to the verdictcontains enough evidence that is reasonable, credible, and of solid value for a reasonable trier of fact to find defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. (people v. brooks (2017) 3 cal.5th 1, 57.) a person is guilty of mayhem when does one of six specified acts: y; (3) disfiguring someone; (4) cutting or disabling the tongue; (5) putting out an eye; [or] (6) people v. santana (2013) 5 56 cal.4th 999, 1003-1004;  203.) to be actionable, an injury to the it is people v. dennis (1985) 169 cal.app.3d 1135, 1138 (dennis); cf. people v. nunes (1920) 47 cal.app. 346, eye would not amount to mayhem unless such disfigurement however, any actionable injury must also be permanent; for these purposes, an injury is permanent notwithstanding the fact that it can be repaired by surgery. (santana, at p. 1007; people v. hill (1994) 23 cal.app.4th 1566, 1571, 1574-1575; people v. newby (2008) 167 cal.app.4th 1341, 1345-1346; people v. williams (1996) 46 cal.app.4th 1767, 1774.) her eye socket blurred and double vision had it not be corrected by surgery; and even with surgery, her peripheral vision is still impaired. courts have found comparable injuries to be actionable. (see dennis, supra, 169 cal.app.3d at p. 1138 [injury that distorts peripheral vision and causes double vision; actionable]; people v. green (1976) 59 cal.app.3d 1, 3-4 [injury that causes double vision and -; actionable].) defendant points to testimony that duran will not need any further surgeries, but absent the prior surgerieswhich is the pertinent inquiryactionable and permanent. 6 disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. ______________________, j. hoffstadt we concur: _________________________, acting p. j. chavez _________________________, j.* goodman * retired judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
