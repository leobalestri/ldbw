filed 7/22/16 p. v. patton ca2/8 not to be published in the official reports california rules of court, rule 8.1115(a), prohibits courts and parties from citing or relying on opinions not certified for publication or ordered published, except as specified by rule 8.1115(b). this opinion has not been certified for publication or ordered published for purposes of rule 8.1115. in the court of appeal of the state of california second appellate district division eight the people, plaintiff and respondent, v. michael patton, defendant and appellant. b261807 (los angeles county super. ct. no. ba409232) appeal from the judgment of the superior court of los angeles county. mildred escobedo, judge. affirmed. william l. heyman, under appointment by the court of appeal, for defendant and appellant. kamala d. harris, attorney general, gerald a. engler, chief assistant attorney general, lance e. winters, assistant attorney general, margaret e. maxwell and nathan guttman, deputy attorneys general, for plaintiff and respondent. * * * * * * * * * * 2 defendant and appellant michael patton appeals from his conviction by jury of attempted first degree murder, along with several related felonies. defendant received a third strike sentence of 60 years to life. he raises claims of insufficient evidence, instructional and sentencing error, and asks this court to review the proceedings regarding his pretrial motion for discovery pursuant to pitchess v. superior court (1974) 11 cal.3d 531 (pitchess). defendant also filed, in propria persona, a petition for habeas corpus (case no. b262100) which we resolve by separate order. factual and procedural background defendant was charged by information with five felonies: possession of a firearm by a felon (pen. code,  29800, subd. (a)(1), 29900, subd. (a)(1); counts 1 and 2); possession of ammunition by a felon ( 30305, subd. (a)(1); count 3); attempted murder ( 187, subd. (a), 664; count 4); and assault with a firearm ( 245, subd. (a)(2); count 5). it was alleged as to count 4 that defendant personally used and discharged a firearm causing great bodily injury in the commission of the offense ( 12022.5, subd. (a), 12022.7, subd. (a), and 12022.53, subds. (b)-(d)). as to count 5, it was alleged defendant personally used a firearm causing great bodily injury in the commission of the offense ( 12022.5, subd. (a), 12022.7, subd. (a)). as to all counts, it was alleged defendant had suffered two prior serious or violent felonies ( 667, subds. (a)(1), (b)-(i), 1170.12). the charges arose from an incident that occurred on march 20, 2013, near the los angeles mission in the skid row neighborhood of downtown los angeles. the testimony and evidence received at trial revealed the following material facts. david johnston is homeless and frequents the area around the los angeles mission located at the intersection of east 5th street and wall street. r tips. he is four feet six inches tall. at around 6:00 a.m. on march 20, mr. johnston was near the los angeles mission standing on the sidewalk along 5th street. several other individuals were there as well, including defendant. defendant is an amputee who uses a motorized scooter to get around. 3 after exchanging words, defendant shot mr. johnston five times (two shots to his chest, one in the back, one to his right hand, and one to his hip). mr. johnston ran down the street to the corner. a woman passing by called 911. mr. johnston was taken to los angeles county + usc medical center to be treated for his injuries. detective louis farias of the los angeles police department was assigned to investigate the shooting. based on information received during the investigation, detective farias, along with several other officers, went to the harold hotel located a short distance from the los angeles mission to look for a possible suspect. they went to the room where defendant resided and found defendant, along with his motorized scooter, inside the room. pursuant to a warrant obtained a few hours later, detective farias recovered a ,some ammunition, and approximately $6,000 in cash om. detective farias also retrieved the video footage from the surveillance cameras located on the outside of the hotel, as well as some footage from cameras located on the exterior of the los angeles mission. officer deon joseph, a veteran officer who worked the skid row area, was also assigned to the investigation of the shooting. from his 17 years working in the neighborhood, officer joseph had developed relationships in the community, particularly with the homeless population, and was familiar with both defendant and mr. johnston. he knew defendant often sold cigarettes illegally on the street and had issued him several warnings not to do so. shortly after the shooting, officer joseph went to the hospital to try to speak with mr. johnston. mr. johnston seemed groggy and was uncooperative, which officer joseph did not find surprising because, in his experience, homeless people and others who reside near skid row are often reluctant to speak with law enforcement even when they are the victims of crime. mr. johnston remained uncooperative and would not talk to officer joseph when he returned a short time later. the next day (march 21), officer joseph returned to the hospital a third time to obtain a statement from mr. johnston about what had happened. he recorded the 4 conversation but did not advise mr. johnston that he was doing so, believing he would be reluctant to speak truthfully about the incident if he knew he was being recorded. mr. johnston was still a little groggy, but coherent and able to have a conversation. officer joseph did not have any trouble understanding him. officer joseph told mr. johnston the detectives might be able to help him with his probation and receive witness protection, but they needed his help because they had someone in custody but needed mr. johnston to identify the shooter, if possible. mr. he was standing outside the mission with several other people where defendant se mr. a six-pack photographic lineup card had been prepared by detective farias with when officer joseph showed mr. johnston the six-pack, he said he recognized everyone. mr. johnston expressed concern that if he pointed out the shooter, and people were going to be in court, then people would know he had pointed out the shooter. mr. johnston said he would not photograph or sign anything. officer joseph told him to just point to the correct photograph. mr. johnston pointed to defendant he then wheelchair ass dude. ride around at trial, mr. johnston said he did not want to testify. he had tried to avoid being served with a subpoena to appear. mr. johnston said he did not know who shot him, but that it was not defendant. he claimed the shooter was actually someone about six feet tall. he said he had never spoken to any officers at the hospital. mr. johnston said he did not want to get hurt or in trouble for lying about who shot him. recorded statement to officer joseph was played for the jury, as was the video footage from the exterior security cameras on the harold hotel and the los 5 angeles mission. the black and white footage from the harold hotel shows the sidewalk and fencing alongside the los angeles mission. several individuals are standing on the sidewalk near a tree, including a man of short stature and a man in a motorized scooter. the short man is close to the curb with his back to the street. the man in the scooter is facing away from the camera. it appears that the man using the scooter and the short man are conversing at times. suddenly, the short man and another individual start to run up the street, away from the direction of the camera. the man in the scooter briefly appears to head in the direction of the short man, but then he abruptly turns the scooter around and drives down the sidewalk in the opposite direction and out of view. the other individuals who had been standing around on the sidewalk leave the area. the color footage from the los angeles mission shows a man running up the sidewalk, to the corner and out of view. the person is dressed in a red shirt, a dark hat and jeans, and clutches his chest as he runs. the person is dressed exactly as described by the woman who called 911. a recording of the 911 call was played for the jury. mr. johnston acknowledged during his testimony that he is the person shown running up the sidewalk. defendant did not testify in his own defense and did not call any witnesses. defendant stipulated he had suffered a prior felony conviction for purposes of counts 1 through 3. the jury found defendant guilty on all five counts. in a bifurcated proceeding, the court found true that defendant had suffered two prior convictions for assault with a firearm (pen. code,  245, subd. (a)(2)), one in 1993 and the other in 2000. at the sentencing hearing, the court acknowledged receipt of the sentencing memoranda from both defense counsel and the prosecution, as well as motion to strike pursuant to people v. superior court (romero) (1996) 13 cal.4th 497 (romero). before any argument took place, defendant requested to proceed without with faretta v. california (1975) 422 u.s. 806. 6 romero motion. the the motion as to counts 4 and 5. the court sentenced defendant as a third-strike offender to a term of 60 years to life, calculated as follows: 25 years to life on count 4, the base term, plus a consecutive term of 25 years to life for the firearm enhancement pursuant to penal code section 12022.53, subdivision (d), plus 10 years for the two priors pursuant to section 667, subdivision (a)(1). the court imposed and stayed sentence, pursuant to section 654, on the remaining counts. defendant was awarded 717 days of custody credits. this appeal followed. on february 24, 2015, defendant filed, in propria persona, a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. this court forwarded a copy of the petition to case no. b262100) to be considered in conjunction with this appeal. respondent requested transmittal of the trial exhibits to be included in the appellate record. on december 18, 2015, this court received from the superior court one envelope of trial exhibits, including the video and audio recordings of the surveillance videthe hospital. upon review of the record, it was discovered that the transcripts related to pitchess motion were not included. on our own motion, we ordered the record augmented and directed the superior court to prepare and transmit the transcripts of the proceedings dated august 26 and 27, 2013. on june 17, 2016, we received the sealed transcripts. brief, clarifying that the substantial evidence argument raised as to count 4 also applied to count 5. respondent did not file a responsive brief. on the day before oral argument, we arguing instructional error and ineffective assistance of counsel with respect to the omission of calcrim no. 358. respondent filed a supplemental opposition letter brief, and defendant filed a reply brief. 7 discussion 1. the instruction on attempted voluntary manslaughter defendant contends the court erred by refusing his requested instruction on attempted voluntary manslaughter, a lesser included offense to attempted murder. we review a claim of instructional error de novo. (people v. alvarez (1996) 14 cal.4th 155, 217.) we find no error. if there is substantial evidence that only the lesser crime was committed (people v. smith (2013) 57 cal.4th 232, 239; accord, people v. bradford (1997) 15 cal.4th 1229, 1344-1345.) lesser included offense must be given only when the evidence warrants such an instruction. [citation.] to warrant such an instruction, there must be substantial the defendant committed the lesser offense. [citation.] speculation is insufficient to require the giving of an instruction on a people v. mendoza (2000) 24 cal.4th 130, 174, italics added.) attempted voluntary manslaughter is a lesser included offense of attempted murder. (people v. van ronk (1985) 171 cal.app.3d 818, 824-825.) an attempted murder may be reduced to attempted voluntary manslaughter where the evidence shows an attempted intentional killing without malice. absence of malice may be shown either by evidence the defendant acted in a sudden quarrel or heat of passion, or in the unreasonable but good faith belief of having to act in self-defense. (see people v. barton (1995) 12 cal.4th 186, 199 (barton).) defendant contends he was entitled to an instruction on sudden quarrel/heat of passion (calcrim no. 603). an instruction on sudden quarrel/heat of passion is disturbed by passion to such an extent as would cause the ordinarily reasonable person of average disposition to act rashly and without deliberation and reflection . . . . (barton, supra, 12 cal.4th at 8 p. 201, italics added.) the provocation which incites the defendant to homicidal conduct in the heat of passion must be caused by the victim [citation] or be conduct reasonably believed by the defendant to have been engaged in by the victim. (people v. johnston (2003) 113 cal.app.4th 1299, 1311, italics added; accord, people v. carasi otherwise initiate the provocation must be such that an average, sober person would be so inflamed that he or she would lose reason and judgment. adequate provocation and heat of passion must be affirmatively demonstrated. (johnston, supra, at pp. 1311-1312.) we find no evidence whatsoever, let alone substantial evidence, that the shooting was provoked by mr. johnston or that defendant was guilty only of the lesser offense of attempted voluntary manslaughter. he was standing near defendant while he was selling cigarettes and other items to individuals on the sidewalk. mr. johnston said defendant told him to leave or he would shoot him. when mr. johnston did not leave, defendant shot him twice in the chest, at nearly point blank range, once in the back as he ran away, plus once each in the hand and in the hip. the black and white video footage, while not clearly showing a gun as incident. there was no evidence of any kind that mr. johnston acted in a provocative way towards defendant before the shooting. 2. calcrim no. 358 defendant contends that at the time of trial in 2014, the court had a sua sponte was at issue, and that the court failed to so instruct the jury. alternatively, defendant contends that even if the court did not have a duty to instruct, defense counsel provided ineffective assistance by asking the court to withdraw the instruction from the packet of instructions the court had prepared to give the jury and to not give the instruction. during discussions with counsel about jury instructions, the court asked defense counsel if he wanted to request modification of the proposed instructions and defense 9 counsel said that calcrim no. 358 should be excluded because he did no[was] any evidence [defthe court agreed to remove the instruction from the packet. shortly thereafter while the parties were discussing whether an instruction on voluntary manslaughter would be appropriate, the prosecutor read from to officer joseph at the hospital in which he relayed that defendant told him, just before the shooting, to leave the area or defense c the discussion then continued about whether the evidence supported an instruction on voluntary manslaughter, but the issue of calcrim no. 358 was not revisited. you have heard evidence that the defendant made [an] oral or written statement[s] (before the trial/while the court was not in session). you must decide whether the defendant made any (such/of these) statement[s], in whole or in part. if you decide that the defendant made such [a] statement[s], consider the statement[s], along with all the other evidence, in reaching your verdict. it is up to you to decide how much importance to give to the statement[s]. [] [consider with caution any statement made by (the/a) defendant tending to show (his/her) guilt unless the statement was written or otherwise recorded.] in 2014, when this case went to trial, the trial court had a sua sponte duty to give calcrim no. 358 whenever evidence of an extrajudicial oral statement by the . (people v. miranda (2015) 236 cal.app.4th 978, 990 (miranda).) in 2015, the supreme court held in people v. diaz (2015) 60 cal.4th 1176, 1187 (diaz) that calcrim no. 358 applied in cases involving criminal threats, but otherwise it is more appropriate to permit defendants to determine whether to request the instruction than to require the trial judge to give it in every case. (diaz, at p. 1192.) the diaz court declined to decide the issue of retroactivity. (miranda, supra, 236 cal.app.4th at p. 990.) we need not resolve whether the court erred in to not instruct the jury with calcrim no. 358, because any instructional error was 10 harmless under the state law standard for error enunciated in people v. watson (1956) 46 cal.2d 818, 835-836. (see people v. salazar (2016) 63 cal.4th 214, 251 (salazar) [concluding state law standard of error applies to alleged failure to give cautionary instruction]; diaz, supra, 60 cal.4th at p. 1195 [same].) statement attributed to the defendant was in fact made, courts examining the prejudice in failing to give the instruction examine the record to see if there was any conflict in the evidence about the exact words used, their meaning, or whether the admissions were (people v. dickey (2005) 35 cal.4th 884, 905.) where there is no conflict in the evidence, but rather, simply a denial by the defendant of the statement attributed to him or her, the failure to give the instruction has been held harmless. (see, e.g., dickey, at p. 906; diaz, supra, 60 cal.4th at pp. 1196-1197; people v. bunyard (1988) 45 cal.3d 1189, 1224-1225; miranda, supra, 236 cal.app.4th at pp. 990-991.) the record demonstrates unequivocally there was no factual dispute about the words attributed to defendant by mr. johnston just prior to the shooting. moreover, the jury was properly instructed with calcrim no. 226 concerning witness credibility and [w]hen the trial court otherwise has thoroughly instructed the jury on assessing the credibility of witnesses, we have concluded the jury was adequately warned to view their testimony with caution. (diaz, supra, 60 cal.4th at p. 1196 [finding harmless the failure to give the cautionary instruction where jury was instructed with calcrim no. 226 and there was no factual conflict as to the statement attributed to the defendant]; accord, salazar, supra, 63 cal.4th at pp. 250-251 [concluding the same as to caljic no. 2.71.7, the predecessor instruction to calcrim no. 358].) here, the jury heard the testimony of pretrial statement and identification of defendant as the shooter, as well as the audio recording of that statement which includes the statement that just prior to the shooting defendant told mr. johnston to leave or he was going to shoot him. they heard fairly detailed testimony from mr. johnston about his desire not to testify, his fear of retaliation 11 on the street, and his claim that the shooter was not defendant but rather someone who the prosecutor and defense counsel emphasized the above, the jury was instructed with calcrim no. 226. defendant has not shown that an additional instruction advising the jury to view extrajudicial oral statements by defendant with caution would have resulted in a more favorable verdict to defendant. stance claim fails for the same reasons. the burden is on defendant to establish ineffective assistance by a preponderance of the evidence. (people v. ledesma (1987) 43 cal.3d 171, 218.) a counsel failed to act in a manner to be expected of reasonably competent attorneys acting as diligent advocates, and that it is reasonably probable a more favorable determination people v. cudjo (1993) 6 cal.4th 585, 623, citing strickland v. washington (1984) 466 u.s. 668, 687-696.) on direct appeal, this burden is stringent. (people v. mendoza tello (1997) 15 cal.4th 264, 266-267.) we cannot say that no reasonably competent attorney would have asked the court to not give calcrim no. 358 in this case. as the supreme court recognized in diaz, [t]he cautionary instruction does not reflect a legal principle with which jurors would be unfamiliar absent the instruction, and the defendant may not always want the instruction to be given. (diaz, supra, 60 cal.4th at p. 1189.) moreover, defendant cannot demonstrate that it is reasonably probable he would have obtained a more favorable result had the instruction been given. 3. the evidence supporting counts 4 and 5 defendant s he committed attempted premeditated murder or assault with a firearm. our task is to review the whole record in the light most favorable to the judgment to determine whether it discloses substantial evidencethat is, evidence that is reasonable, credible, and of solid valuesuch that a reasonable trier of fact could find the defendant guilty people v. rodriguez 12 on thpeople v. bolin (1998) 18 cal.4th 297, 331; accord, people v. manriquez (2005) 37 cal.4th 547, 577 (manriquez).) we conclude the record contains solid evidence in support of the verdict. defendant contends the evidence is insufficient to establish he was the shooter, that he had the requisite intent to kill, or to establish premeditation. defendant argues the video does not show clearly who is in the motorized scooter, and does not show a gun or who shot mr. johnston. he further argues the incident happened very quickly and that, at trial, mr. johnston denied defendant was the shooter, testifying instead that the person who shot him was six feet tall. in people v. anderson (1968) 70 cal.2d 15, 26-three types of evidenceevidence of planning activity, preexisting motive, and manner of killingthat assist in reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence supporting findings of people v. mendoza (2011) 52 cal.4th 1056, 1069 (mendozaanderson did not purport to establish an exhaustive list that would exclude all other types and combinations of (ibid.; accord, people v. perez (1992) 2 cal.4th 1117, 1125, and manriquez, supra, 37 cal.4th at p. 577.) furrequired to convict a defendant of attempted murder, may in many cases be inferred from y people v. smith (2005) 37 cal.4th 733, 741.) defendant, a convicted felon, was carrying a loaded firearm in public. defendant told mr. johnston he did not like having mr. johnston standing near where he was selling alcohol, cigarettes and beer. when mr. johnston told him he was not going to leave, defendant said you better leave right now, or mr. johnston did 13 not leave, and defendant shot him at close range twice in his chest, a vital area of the body; conduct which could easily have resulted in a lethal injury. defendant also shot mr. johnston in the back as he ran away. the video footage shows defendant pursuing mr. johnston as he fled, before defendant turns his scooter around and heads in the opposite direction, fleeing the scene. close range in a manner that could have inflicted a mortal wound had the shot been on (people v. houston (2012) 54 cal.4th 1186, 1218; see also manriquez, supraof premeditation apeople v. brito (1991) 232 cal.app.3d 316, 323-324 [fact that the defendant made decision, within a matter of a few seconds, to shoot fleeing victim in back did not defeat finding of deliberation].) we find it hard to imagine that, with this evidence, any reasonable juror could entertain a reasonable doubt that defendant deliberately and with premeditation intended to kill mr. johnston. the same evidence plainly supports the ing that defendant committed an assault with a firearm. finally, defendant is correct that, at trial, mr. johnston denied that he had identified defendant as the shooter and testified that the person who shot him was not in a motorized scooter but was actually six feet tall. however, mr. johnston also testified in some detail about his fear of retaliation on the street for identifying the shooter. given was entitled to give , over his denials at trial about the true identity of the shooter. 4. the romero motion defendant contends the court erred in denying his romero motion with respect to count 4. we disagree. g on a romero motion under the deferential abuse of discretion standard. (people v. williams (1998) 17 cal.4th 148, 162 (williams); accord, people v. carmony (2004) 33 cal.4th 367, 375-376 (carmony) [holding abuse of 14 t be set aside unless an affirmative showing is made that the sentence is irrational or arbitrary. (carmony, at pp. 376-decision is so irrational or arbitrary that no reasonable person could id. at p. 377.) romero motion in part, striking the prior strikes for sentencing purposes as to counts 1, 2, and 3. however, the court denied the motion as to counts 4 and 5. the court acted within its discretion in denying the motion as to some counts. (people v. garcia (1999) 20 cal.4th 490, 503-504 [trial court may, consistent with respect to one count, but no in exercising its discretion whether to strike a prior strike allegation, the court considers various factors, including ackground, character, and prospects, and whether the defendant may properly be deemed outside the spirit of the three strikes law. (williams, supra, 17 cal.4th at p. 161.) the three strikes law creates carmony, supra(ibid.) defendant concedes he has two prior strikes for serious felonies under the three strikes law, both for assault with a firearm in violation of penal code section 245, subdivision (a)(2); one conviction was in 1993, the other in 2000. defendantrecord also includes two convictions for possession for sale of marijuana, two convictions for resisting an officer, and a conviction for assault with a deadly weapon by a prisoner. while defendant had not had a conviction for several years preceding the shooting of mr. johnston, the record nonetheless demonstrates a history of violent criminal conduct 15 discretion by the trial court in declining to strike the strikes as to counts 4 and 5. 5. the eighth amendment claim defendant argues his sentence amounts to cruel and unusual punishment and violates the eighth amendment on the following grounds: (1) penal code section 12022.53, subdivision (d) is facially unconstitutional as it fails to recognize gradations of culpability; and (2) the statute is unconstitutional as applied to defendant because it mandates a grossly disproportionate sentence relative to the offense. court, but the underlying disputed facts must be viewed in the light most favorable to the (people v. martinez (1999) 76 cal.app.4th 489, 496 (martinez).) we do not llenge to penal code section 12022.53, subdivision (d) is unpersuasive. defendant contends the failure of the statute to recognize gradations in a firearm regardless of the circumstances of the shooting. defendant acknowledges that at least two courts have rejected the argument, but argues those holdings of martinez, supra, 76 cal.app.4th 489 and people v. zepeda (2001) 87 cal.app.4th 1183, 1214-1215 are correct on the issue before us. (see also people v. alvarez (2001) 88 cal.app.4th 1110, 1114-1119 [citing martinez with approval in rejecting equal protection challenge to  12022.53, subd. (d)].) as martinez represents a careful gradation by the legislature of the consequences of gun use in the commission of serious crimes. the section is limited, in the first place, to convictions of certain very serious felonies. the statute then sets forth three gradations of punishment based on increasingly serious types and consequences of firearm use in the commission of the designated felonies: 10 years if the defendant merely used a firearm, 20 years if the defendant personally and intentionally discharged it, and 25 years to life if the 16 (martinez, supra, 76 cal.app.4th at p. 495.) -applied challenge is equally unavailing. the eighth amendment, which forbids cruel and unusual punishments, contains a ewing v. california (2003) 538 u.s. 11, 20 [affirming sentence of 25 years to life imposed on a third-strike offender convicted of felony grand theft for the theft of $1,200 worth of merchandise].) the severity of the charged crime(s). (ewing, at p. 21.) outside the context of a capital ibid.) tes the state prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment conspeople v. russell (2010) 187 cal.app.4th 981, 993.) here, defendant had suffered two prior convictions for assault with a firearm. in the charged offense, the evidence showed that defendant threatened to shoot mr. johnston for no reason other than that defendant did not want mr. johnston to stand near him on the sidewalk. there was no evidence of provocative behavior by mr. johnston. defendant then shot at mr. johnston at close range five times, including once in the back as mr. johnston tried to flee. it was a violent crime carried out by an individual with a violent criminal history. defendant has not demonstrated that the sentence is disproportionate to the offense or otherwise shocks the conscience. 6. the pitchess motion defendant asks this court to review the sealed proceedings, as well as the actual personnel records reviewed by the trial court, related to his pitchess motion and to determine whether any discoverable materials were wrongfully withheld. respondent does not object to our review of the sealed transcripts. 17 in august 2013, defendant moved pretrial to discover any relevant personnel records related to detective farias and officer joseph. the supporting declaration of counsel asserts that detective farias and officer joseph conducted an illegal search of was obtained; illegally seized various items; and stole some money recovered from a dufthe trial court granted motion in part, ordering that as to both detective farias and officer joseph, any complaints pertaining to perjury or preparation of false police reports, as well records concerning any response or discipline imposed following any investigation of such complaints, were to be turned over to the defense. the in camera hearing held august 27, 2013, was transcribed by a court reporter, the custodian of records was placed under oath, and the record of proceedings was sealed. we have independently reviewed the sealed transcript of the in camera proceedings and motion. (people v. mooc (2001) 26 cal.4th 1216, 1228-1230; see also people v. myles (2012) 53 cal.4th 1181, 1209 [where records reviewed by trial court in camera are adequately specified in sealed transcript to afford meaningful appellate review, then review of actual records is unnecessary].) disposition the judgment of conviction is affirmed. grimes, j. we concur: bigelow, p. j. flier, j.
