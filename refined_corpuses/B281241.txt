filed 11/29/17 p. v. buchwitz ca2/3 not to be published in the official reports california rules of court, rule 8.1115(a), prohibits courts and parties from citing or relying on opinions not certified for publication or ordered published, except as specified by rule 8.1115(b). this opinion has not been certified for publication or ordered published for purposes of rule 8.1115. in the court of appeal of the state of california second appellate district division three the people, plaintiff and respondent, v. randy buchwitz, defendant and appellant. b281241 (los angeles county super. ct. no. ba420380) appeal from a judgment of the superior court of los angeles county, leslie a. swain, judge. affirmed in part, reversed in part. sally patrone brajevich, under appointment by the court of appeal, for defendant and appellant. xavier becerra, attorney general, gerald a. engler, chief assistant attorney general, lance e. winters, assistant attorney general, steven d. matthews and rama r. maline, deputy attorneys general, for plaintiff and respondent. _________________________ 2 this is defendant and appellant randy buchwitzmodified the judgment and, as modified, we affirmed it. after the remittitur issued, the trial court modified buchwitz consistent with the remittitur but also imposed two additional one-year terms under penal code section 667.5, subdivision (b).1 buchwitz therefore brought this second appeal, contending that his sentence must be modified again, this time to strike those two 1-year terms. we agree and reverse the sentences imposed on the two 1-year prison priors but otherwise affirm the judgment. background in january 2014, buchwitz caused a fire in his motel room while manufacturing concentrated cannabis using butane honey oil. he was charged with various offenses arising out of this incident. a jury found buchwitz guilty of: count 1, manufacturing a controlled substance other than pcp (health & saf. code,  11379.6, subd. (a)); count 2, vandalism with over $400 in damage ( 594, subd. (a)); and count 3, recklessly causing fire to an inhabited structure ( 452, subd. (b)). buchwitz was sentenced on may 11, 2015. he first admitted having suffered five prior convictions (case nos. pa021403, pa027667, pa037966, pa059638 & pa069262) within the meaning of section 667.5, subdivision (b). the court then sentenced buchwitz to seven years on count 1 and a consecutive one-year term on count 3. and, as we later explain, the record is ambiguous whether the court sentenced buchwitz to eight months, stayed, or to two years, stayed, on count 2. the 1 all further undesignated statutory references are to the penal code. 3 court imposed a three-year term under health and safety code section 11370.2, subdivision (b), based on a prior conviction for violating health and safety code section 11383.5. the court also imposed a one-year term for the prison prior in case number pa059638. the court struck the remaining four prison priors.2 therefore was 12 years in state prison. buchwitz appealed, contending only that the one-year sentence on count 3 should have been stayed under section 654 and that the three-year term under health and safety code section 11370.2, subdivision (b) was unauthorized. agreeing, this court modified b sentence to stay the sentence on count 3 and to strike the three years imposed under health and safety code section 11370.2. (people v. buchwitz (aug. 2, 2016, b264571 [nonpub. opn.] (buchwitz i).)3 the remittitur issued on october 12, 2016. on february 23, 2017, the trial court resentenced buchwitz. the court reimposed the seven-year term on count 1; imposed eight months, stayed, on count 2; and sentenced buchwitz to two years (rather than one), stayed, on count 3. the court struck the three-year term imposed under health and 2 the minute order and abstract of judgment were silent as to the priors. 3 he judgment is modified to stay, under penal code section 654, the one-year sentence imposed on count 3. the three-year term imposed under health and safety code section 11370.2 is also stricken. the clerk of the superior court is directed to modify the abstract of judgment and to forward the modified abstract to the department of corrections and rehabilitation. as modified, the judgment is affirmed.(buchwitz i, supra, b264571.) 4 safety code section 11370.2. the court again sentenced defendant to one year under section 667.5, subdivision (b), for the prison prior in case number pa059638. but the court also sentenced buchwitz to two of the previously stricken one-year terms under section 667.5, subdivision (b) (case nos. pa027667 & pa037966). the court did not address, and the minute order and abstract of judgment were silent as to, the remaining two prison priors. new sentence therefore was 10 years in state prison.4 buchwitz then brought this second appeal. discussion buchwitz contends that the trial court erred in sentencing him to the additional two 1-year terms under section 667.5, subdivision (b). before directly addressing that contention, some additional context is in order. at the original may 11, 2015 sentencing hearing, the trial court, as we have said, sentenced buchwitz to seven years on count 1 and to a consecutive one year on count 3. but what the court did on count 2 is less clear. although the minute order states that the court imposed eight monthsindeed, the court made an oral statement to that effectit appears that the court actually imposed the midterm of two years. the court initially said it was sentencing buchwitz to -stayed. the prosecutor then inquire 4 defendant and the people objected, with defense counsel py with what the court did, but i want to protect myself just in case. i just want to lodge an objection to basis for the 5 midterm based on this colloquy, the court imposed the midterm of two years on count 2 and not one-third the midterm of eight months. this makes sense, because the court stayed the sentence on count 2. and, when a court stays a sentence under section 654, the one-third-the-midterm rule of section 1170.1, subdivision (a), does not apply. (people v. relkin (2016) 6 cal.app.5th 1188, 1197; see also people v. alford (2010) 180 cal.app.4th 1463, 1468.) thus, the court could not as a matter of law impose eight months (one-third the midterm) on count 2; it had to impose a full term and stay it. (relkin, at p. 1198; alford, at p. 1472.) this clarifies what happened after our remittitur issued. the trial court, apparently based on the clerical error in the record, imposed eight months, instead of two years, on count 2. the court properly struck the three-year term under the health and safety code and stayed the sentence on count 3. but it did several other things. -third-the-t imposed the low term of two years on count 3 and stayed that two-year sentence. (people v. relkin, supra, 6 cal.app.5th at p. 1197.) this did not conflict with the remittitur. after a remittitur, the court to which the matter has been remitted shall makders necessary to carry the judgment into effect. 1265, subd. (a); people v. dutra (2006) 145 cal.app.4th 1359, 1366.) our remittitur modified the judgment and stayed -year sentence buchwitz i, supra, b264571, at p. 6.) at that time, one year was the sentence. but once count 3 was stayed, the trial court had to impose and stay a full term because the one-third-the-midterm rule no longer applied. 6 this brings us to the second thing the trial court did and to primary contention of error: according to him, imposing sentence on the two additional prison priors exceeded the scope of the remittitur. the order of a reviewing court is in the remittitur, which defines the scope of jurisdiction of the court to which the matter is returned. (see generally  1260 [reviewing reverse, affirm, or modify a judgment or order appealed from, or reduce the degree of the offense or attempted offense or the punishment imposed, and may set aside, affirm, or modify any or all of the proceedings subsequent to, or dependent upon, such judgment or order, and may, if proper, order a new trial and may, if proper, remand the cause to the trial court for such further proceedings as may be just under the griset v. fair political practices com. (2001) 25 cal.4th 688, 701.) any material variance from the remittitur is unauthorized and void. (ayyad v. sprint spectrum, l.p. (2012) 210 cal.app.4th 851, 859-860; people v. dutra, supra, 145 cal.app.4th at pp. 1367-1369.) here, we did not remand for resentencing. (see, e.g., people v. burgos (2004) 117 cal.app.4th 1209, 1214, fn. 4; people v. burbine (2003) 106 cal.app.4th 1250, 1258 [when appellate court remands case for resentencing, trial court is entitled to consider the entire sentencing scheme].) rather, the remittitur was limited and did not address the prison priors. indeed, neither buchwitz nor the people, in the prior appeal, raised any issue as to the priors, and therefore buchwitz i did not address any issue regarding them. because our remittitur was limited in scope and did not remand for resentencing, the trial court, by imposing the two 1-year prison priors in case numbers pa027667 and pa037966, exceeded the scope of the remittitur. 7 the people, however, argue that the trial court could impose the additional prison priors because an unauthorized sentence may be corrected at any time. (people v. scott (1994) 9 cal.4th 331, 354, fn. 17.) stated otherwise, if the trial court failed to impose or strike the four remaining prison priors at the original sentencing hearing, that was an unauthorized sentence the court was entitled to correct after our remittitur issued. (see generally people v. turrin (2009) 176 cal.app.4th 1200, 1205 [unauthorized sentence may be corrected at any time]; people v. langston (2004) 33 cal.4th 1237, 1241 [imposition of section 667.5, subdivision (b) enhancement is mandatory once prior prison term is found true; enhancement must either be imposed or stricken].) there was, however, no unauthorized sentence for the trial court to correct. at the original may 11, 2015 sentencing hearing, the court imposed sentence on just one of prison priors and struck the remaining four prison priors. after [the] aggregate 12-pretrial offer, but i think when there is a maximum of 16 years based on all his priors, i think . . . 12 years is a very lengthy the court therefore was aware of the remaining four prison priors but clearly did not intend to impose consecutive sentences on them. instead, the court imposed one prison prior in case number pa059638 but struck the others (case nos. pa021403, pa027667, pa037966 & pa069262). having thus imposed an authorized sentence which was thereafter not challenged on appeal by either the people or defendant or otherwise addressed 8 in our remittitur, the trial court had no jurisdiction to resentence buchwitz on those prison priors. in addition to striking the improperly imposed two prison priors, the trial court should also correct the minute order and abstract of judgment to reflect the sentence imposed on count 2, which was the midterm of two years, stayed, and not eight months. (people v. mitchell (2001) 26 cal.4th 181, 185; see also people v. sanders (2012) 55 cal.4th 731, 743 & fn. 13; in re ricky h. (1981) 30 cal.3d 176, 191.) disposition the judgment is reversed and the trial court is directed to strike the two 1-year prison priors imposed in case numbers pa027667 and pa037966. the clerk of the superior court is directed to prepare a corrected minute order and abstract of judgment reflecting these sentences as well as the two years imposed but stayed on count 2 and the two years imposed but stayed on count 3. the clerk of the superior court is directed to forward the corrected abstract of judgment to the department of 9 corrections and rehabilitation. in all other respects, the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports dhanidina, j. we concur: edmon, p. j. lavin, j. judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
