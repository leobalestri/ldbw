(a), 664),1 and 1 all further statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise indicated. 4 (2) shooting at an occupied vehicle ( 246).2 the people also charged vaughn with being a felon in possession of a firearm ( 29800, subd. (a)(1)). the people alleged that all three crimes direction of, or in association with a criminal street gang. ( 186.22, subd. (b)(4).) the people further alleged that the attempted premeditated murder involved personal use (as to vaughn) and (as to love) of a firearm ( 12022.53, subd. (d)). the people lastly alleged that three strikes law ( 667, subds. (b)-(j), 1170.12, subds. (a)-(d)); that love had served one prior prison term ( 667.5, subd. (b)); and that vaughn had served two prior prison terms (ibid.). the case proceeded to a joint trial using separate juries. both juries were instructed on all charged offenses. was also instructed that it could convict love of the charged offenses either (1) as a direct aider and abettor of those offenses, and (2) as a natural and probable consequence of aiding and abetting vaughn in the commission of an assault or a conspiracy to commit assault. enhance the trial court sentenced vaughn to prison for 55 years to life plus 10 years. for the attempted premeditated murder count, the court imposed a life sentence with a minimum 15-year parole term plus 25 years for the firearm enhancement. for the shooting at an occupied vehicle count, the court imposed a consecutive life sentence with a minimum 15-year parole term. 2 the people also charged defendants with the attempted that charge prior to trial. 5 and for the felon-in-possession count, the court imposed a consecutive 10-year sentence, comprised of a three-year base term plus seven years for the gang enhancement. the trial court sentenced love to prison for 47 years to life. for the attempted premeditated murder count, the court imposed a life sentence with a minimum seven-year parole term plus 25 years for the firearm enhancement. for the shooting at an occupied vehicle count, the court imposed a consecutive life sentence with a minimum 15-year parole term. the court stayed the gang enhancement for the attempted premeditated murder count. each defendant filed a timely notice of appeal. discussion i. jury selection vaughn argues that the trial court erred in overruling his objection use of peremptory strikes to remove four african-american female jurors violated batson v. kentucky (1986) 476 u.s. 79 (batson) and people v. wheeler (1978) 22 cal.3d 258 (wheeler). although a prosecutor may exercise a peremptory challenge to strike a people v. scott (2015) 61 cal.4th 363, 387 (scott)), he or she may not jurors on the basis of group bias of an identifiable group distinguished on racial, religious, ethnic, or similar grounds.people v. bell (2007) 40 cal.4th 582, 596.) set forth in batson, supra, 476 u.s. at page 88 and his state right to a trial by a jury drawn from a representative cross-section of the community under article i, section 16, of the california 6 constitution set forth in wheeler, supra, 22 cal.3d at pages 276 to 277. (accord, people v. gutierrez (2017) 2 cal.5th 1150, 1157 (gutierrez).) a defendant bears the ultimate burden of showing a constitutional violation (people v. lenix (2008) 44 cal.4th 602, 612-613 (lenix), but courts employ a three-step, burden-shifting mechanism in assessing whether a batson/wheeler violation has by showing that the totality of the relevant facts gives rise to an inference of discriminatory purpose in the exercise of peremptory scott, supra, 61 cal.4th at p. 383.) if the trial court finds that the defendant has established this prima facie case, excusing the juror by offering permissible, nondiscriminatory justifications. (ibid.) lastand reasoned effort to evaluate the nondiscriminatory people v. williams (2013) 56 cal.4th 630, 650), subjectively genuine or instead a pretext for discrimination. (scott, at p. 383; people v. duff (2014) 58 cal.4th 527, 548; people v. jones (2013) 57 cal.4th 899, 917 (jones).) a. pertinent facts 1. initial round of questioning the trial court and counsel began voir dire by questioning 24 prospective jurors. among those jurors were three african-american womennamely, prospective juror nos. 2, 8, and 19. juror no. 2 indicated that she had previously served on a jury in a criminal case that hung. in follow-up questioning, the prosecutor asked juror no. 2 (and others) if she would believe a woman who was turning down a dinner invitation from a male 7 coworker when the womathat she had to the jthe woman was telling the truth, and that her excuse about bunch of cat pic juror no. 8 said she had enforcement because, a few years earlier, a police officer had been ding she also relayed that gang members had jumped her brother and shot her cousin. juror no. 19 stated that she also had a 18 years old, she had been arrested for being present at a house party where drugs were found. the charges against her were ultimately dismissed. she reported that her brother was currently facing a gun charge in los angeles county. she further shared that she participated in an annual walk to commemorate her slain cousin, and that police provide security for the event. 2. first round of strikes the prosecutor struck juror no. 8 and two other jurors. 3. second round of questioning the court called 13 more prospective jurors for questioning. one of those jurors, juror no. 28, was an african-american woman. during individual questioning, the juror said she would 4. second round of strikes the prosecutor exercised peremptory challenges against six jurors, including juror nos. 19, 28, and 2. 8 5. defense objection, response, and court ruling vaughn objected on batson/wheeler grounds after the prosecutor struck juror no. 2. prima facie case ha[d] to provide her reasons for striking the four african-american female jurors. the prosecutor offered the following explanations: as to s was excused as a juror, when she did not turn to face the court future prospects, and (3) the fact that s pending gun charge. as to juror no. 28, the prosecutor cited the issue with finding judgment of someone. participation on a criminal jury that hung, and (2) her act in about the workplace date, which the prosecutor found problematic because she did not want jurors who would look beyond the facts presented. batson/wheeler -neutral bases for exclusion of reflected those reasons. 9 b. analysis vaughn juror nos. 8, 19, and 2was subjectively genuine and not a pretext for discrimination (the third step). we conclude that the trial court did not err. two of the jurorsjuror nos. 8 and 19indicated that they had negative experiences with law enforcement, and the thirdjuror no. 2was on a hung jury. these are valid, nondiscriminatory reasons to strike prospective jurors. (lenix, supra, 44 cal.4th at p. 628 basis of a prospect with law enforcementpeople v. manibusan (2013) 58 cal.4th 4circumstance that a prospective juror has previously sat on a hung jury is a legitimate, race-neutral reason for exercising a ruling. first, vaughn asserts that the ruling is deficient because a -and reasonedwhich requires the court to spell out its reasoning except in cases -gutierrez, supra, 2 cal.5th at pp. 1171-1172.) as justifications for striking the three jurors at issuebased on their prior negative experiences with law enforcement and serving on a hung juryis self-evident. (accord, people v. reynoso (2003) 31 required-neutral reason 10 ive experience with one law enforcement official only means the juror has bad feelings about that specific official, not all law enforcement officials. this contention is at odds with the law noted above, which does not limit prior bad experiences to experiences with a specific officer and with other cases holding that even a bad experiences provide a race-neutral reason to strike that juror (see jones, supra, 57 cal.4th at p. 920). third, vaughn reasons for excusing juror nos. 8 and 2 are pretextual because conduct after the strike to justify the strike, and (2) as to juror no. 2, the hypothetical question was confusing and effectively asked every juror to draw inferences. we need not examine these additional reasons because the prosecutor relied upon at least one acceptable, race-neutral reason to excuse these jurors and because nothing about the additional reasons calls into question the neutrality of the otherwise valid reason for excusal. fourth, vaughn points out that some of the jurors said they could still be fair and impartial. specifically, juror no. 8 said she could still be fair, and juror no. 19 said she also had good experiences with police (which presumably balanced out her bad experience). however, it does not matter whether these jurors could be fair because we are addressing peremptory challenges, not challenges for cause. (people v. mills (2010) 48 cal.4th 158, need not support a challenge for cause].) lastly, vaughn juror nos. 8, 19, and 2 cannot withstand a comparative juror analysis. under whether the 11 just as well to an otprotected ted to serve on the indicate a discriminatory motive. (gutierrez, supra, 2 cal.5th at p. 1173.) vaughn points to three examples. he asserts that -washing hypothetical is wrong: juror no. 11 -washing story was untrue and, unlike juror no. 2, juror no. 11 did not invent new facts to support his answer. vaughn next asserts that juror no. 8 and juror no. iences with law enforcement were no different than responses from juror nos. 11, 21, 34, and 40. again, he is wrong. juror no. 11 said the police did not show up when he was a victim; juror no. 21 said he was at appeared to be a gang unit; and juror nos. 34 and 40 said police had arrested family members. unlike juror nos. 8 and 19, none of these other prospective jurors stated that they viewed these experiences with law enforcement as negative. lastly, vaughn contends that juror no-gang sentiment is no greater than the anti-gang sentiment felt by juror nos. 11 and 13 (who were personally jumped, or had family members jumped, 11 and 13 are not similarly situated to juror no. 8 because they did not have negative law enforcement experiences; thus, we cannot infer decision to strike juror no. 8 but not the other two jurors. ii. instructional errors defendants raise two instructional errors: (1) both defendants contend that the trial court erred in not instructing 12 the jury on the crime of negligent discharge of a firearm ( 246.3) as a lesser included offense to the crime of shooting at an occupied vehicle; and (2) love argues that the court erred in not instructing the jury that he could be liable for attempted premeditated murder as a natural and probable consequence of aiding and abetting an assault or conspiracy to assault only if a foreseen an attempted premeditated murder was a consequence (as opposed to just an attempted murder). we review claims of instructional error de novo. (people v. manriquez (2005) 37 cal.4th 547, 581, 584.) a. lesser included offense of negligent discharge of a firearm a trial court errs in refusing to instruct on a lesser included offense if from which a rational jury could conclude that the defendant committed the lesser offense, and that he is not guilty of the greater offense.people v. whalen (2013) 56 cal.4th 1, 68, quoting people v. depriest required . . . any evidence . . . no matter how evidence from which a jury composed of reasonable [persons] could . . . that the lesser offense, people v. cruz (2008) 44 cal.4th 636, 664.) we independently review the substantiality of evidence for these purposes, and do so by viewing it in the light most favorable to the defendant. (people v. millbrook (2014) 222 cal.app.4th 1122, 1137; people v. posey (2004) 32 cal.4th 193, 218.) the crime of negligent discharge of a firearm is a lesser included offense of the crime of shooting at an occupied vehicle. (people v. ramirez (2009) 45 cal.4th 980, 990 (ramirez).) the 13 crime of shooting at an occupied vehicle requires proof that the defendant ( . . . occupied motor ramirez, at p. 985; people v. manzo (2012) 53 cal.4th 880, 884-885 (manzo).) the crime of negligent discharge of a firearm requires proof that the de,intentionally,which ramirez, at p. 986, quoting people v. alonzo (1993) 13 cal.app.4th 535, 538;  246.3, subd. (a).) accordingly, whether a defendant is guilty of the greater offense of shooting an occupied vehicle or the lesser offense of negligent discharge of a firearm turns on whether he discharged the firearm at an occupied vehicle. (ramirez, supra, 45 cal.4th at p. 990.) for these purposes, a defendant discharges a firearm an occupied vehicle (people v. overman (2005) 126 cal.app.4th 1344, 1355-1356 (overman)), or (2) an ramirez, at p. 990), at least if he circumstances showing a conscious disregard for the probability that one or more bullets will strike the [vehicle] or persons in or overman, at p. 1356; manzo, supra, 53 cal.4th at p. 888; people v. white (2014) 230 cal.app.4th 305, 316). in light of this law, a trial court is required to instruct on the lesser included offense of negligent discharge of a firearm only if there is substantial evidence from which a rational jury could conclude that the defendant conscious disregard for the probability that one or more bullets 14 would strike the vehicle. there was no such substantial evidence here. vaughn victim as the victim crossed an intersection designed for vehicular traffic in a densely populated urban area. not surprisingly, three of the 13 bullets he fired hit a passing car. under these circumstances, no rational jury could conclude that for the probability he would hit a moving (and hence occupied) car. defendants essentially make two arguments. first and chiefly, they assert that vaughn did not fire directly at any car . second, defendants argue that the bullets that hit the occupied car could have ricocheted off of some other surface and thence into the car. although we must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the defendants and, in so doing, draw all reasonable inferences from that evidence, no evidence supports defendants ricochet theory; it is people v. ramon (2009) 175 cal.app.4th 843, 851). more to the point, the mechanism by which the three bullets hit the occupied careither directly or through a ricochethas no effect on whether vaughn was into an intersection and thus was occupied vehicles with conscious disregard for hitting them. b. natural and probable consequences a person is liable for a crime if he commits the crime himself or if he aids and abets another in its commission. ( 31.) a person is liable as an aider and abettor if (1) he knows of the 15 s unlawful purpose, (2) he, by his act or advice, aids, promotes, encourages, commission of the crime, and (3) he acts with the intent or purpose to commit, encourage, or facilitate the actual people v. mccoy (2001) 25 cal.4th 1111, 1118; people v. prettyman (1996) 14 cal.4th 248, 259 (prettyman); people v. beeman (1984) 35 cal.3d 547, 561.) when a person aids and abets a crime, he must have the same intent as the actual perpetrator. (mccoy, at p. 1118 & fn. 1; people v. nguyen (2015) 61 cal.4th 1015, 1054.) an aider and abettor is guilty not only of the crime he but also of any other crime the perpetrator actually commits . . . that is a natural and probable consequence of the intended crime.people v. rangel (2016) 62 cal.4th 1192, 1228-1229; prettyman, supra, 14 cal.4th at p. 261.) before criminal liability will attach for a further crime beyond the intended crime, the people must prove (1) that the defendant aided and abetted the intended crime, and (2) the [intended] crime (prettyman, at pp. 261-262.) in assessing the second element, courts ask: woucircumstances recognize that the further crime was a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the crime the defendant intended to aid and abet? (people v. chiu (2014) 59 cal.4th 155, 165 (chiu); people v. medina (2009) 46 cal.4th 913, 920 (medina); people v. gonzales (2001) 87 cal.app.4th 1, 9-10; people v. woods (1992) 8 cal.app.4th 1570, 1587.) for these purposes, it is enough if the sonably have been contem(medina, at p. 920). the further 16 ibid.) under abettor actually (ibid.; gonzales, at p. 9.) love asserts that the trial court erred because it instructed the jury that the further crime that must be a reasonably foreseeable consequence of assault or conspiracy to assault was attempted murder, and not attempted premeditated murder. tdecision in people v. favor (2012) 54 cal.4th 868 (favor) not attempted premeditated murderqualifies as the nontarget offense to whicid. at p. 879, italics omitted.) favor went on to explain that the jury must nevertheless separately determine whether the attempted murder itself was willful, deliberate, and premeditated. (id. at p. 880.) love contends that favor was wrongly decided, and makes two arguments in support of that contention. decision in chiu, supra, 59 cal.4th 155, effectively overruled (or, at a minimum, effectively undermined) favor. we disagree. chiu held that the greatest crime for which a defendant could be held liable on a natural and probable consequences theory was second degree murder, not first degree murder. (chiu, at pp. 165-166.) chiu did not speak to the public policy considerations underlying the crime of attempted murder. to the contrary, chiu went out of its way to distinguish and preserve favor. (chiu, at p. 163.) although, as love points out, our supreme court has granted 17 review in people v. mateo, review granted may 11, 2016, s232674, in part to decide whether chiu was wrong to leave favor intact, we are bound by chiu until the supreme court overturns it. (auto equity sales, inc. v. superior court (1962) 57 cal.2d 450, 455-456.) second, love contends that the united states supreme alleyne v. united states (2013) 570 u.s. 99 (alleyne) has overruled favor, and that we need not wait for our supreme court in mateo to recognize that fact before discarding favor. (see people v. flores (2007) 147 cal.app.4th 199, 211.) specifically, love asserts that chiu distinguished (and upheld) favor in part because the premeditation element of attempted crime (chiu, supra, 59 cal.4th at p. 163), and that alleyneas post-alleyne decisions have recognizedundermines any distinction between penalty provisions and elements when it comes to what a jury must find beyond a reasonable doubt. (alleyne, at pp. 111-112 [facts that establish a mandatory minimum sentence, despite dealing with the penalty, must be found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt]; people v. banks (2014) 59 cal.4th 1113, 1152 , and premeditated nature of an the functional valid as far as it goes, but it does not require us to vacate his attempted murder conviction. that is because the duty to present the question of whether an attempted murder was premeditated to a jury is a function of apprendi v. new jersey (2000) 530 u.s. 466, and has been recognized by our supreme court as far back as 2004long before alleyne. (see people 18 v. seel (2004) 34 cal.4th 535, 548.) in accordance with this long-and, by its guilty verdict, necessarily did findthat the attempted murder in this case was premeditated, willful, and deliberate. question whether the crime that must be reasonably foreseeable to a reasonable person in loveattempted premeditated murder. this alleged instructional error affects, at most, this single element of the natural and probable consequences doctrine. we need not definitively resolve the continued validity of favor (in light of chiu or alleyne) because no matter how our supreme court resolves that question in mateo, any instructional error in this case was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. (people v. merritt (2017) 2 cal.5th 819.) where, as here, we are dealing with element, we must ask: was the evidence going to that omitted controvertedid. at p. 832.) eard was not a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the assault or conspiracy to assault a hoover criminal gang member. in light of this jury finding, the sole remaining question is whether the still-missing elementthat is, that the reasonably foreseeable attempted murder would be willful, deliberate, and premeditateduncontrovertedsuggest thaccidental, or spontaneous attempted murder. to the contrary, defendants drove into rival gang territory in the midst of a conflagration of gang warfare to carry out the very violence they 19 enacted in a video posted online. on these facts, any error in the foreseeable attempted murder be premeditated was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. iii. evidentiary error vaughn argues that the trial court erred in rejecting his argument that the six-person photo spread presented to the shooting victim violated due process because it was impermissibly suggestive. a. pertinent facts a month after the shooting, police presented the shooting victim with a photo spread containing six photographs, including all six photos depicted african-american men in their teens or 20s; all six men had their hair in braids; and all six men were wearing different clothing. the background color of the six photos varied: three had a darker gray background; one had a light gray background; one had a light gray background with a mix of blue; and one had an all-blue background. four of the men had closed mouths; one had a slightly open mouth; and one was smiling. five of the photos were exactly the same size; one was cropped slightly smaller. the photograph of vaughn was the one that was slightly smaller in size, with the all-blue background, and in which he was smiling. b. analysis people v. clark (2016) 63 cal.4th 522, 556.) 20 in assessing whether the identification procedure is unduly suggestive (the first step), courts ask whether the procedure . . . a people v. brandon (1995) 32 cal.app.4th 1033, 1052; people v. ochoa (1998) 19 distinguishable from the brandon, at p. 10 from the others in a way that would suggest the witness should select him(people v. yeoman (2003) 31 cal.4th 93, 124 (yeoman).) n is otherwise view the suspect at the time of the offense degree of attention at the time of the offense, his or her prior description of the suspect certainty demonstrated at the time of the identification and (5) (people v. cunningham (2001) 25 cal.4th 926, 989.) it is unclear whether we review suggestiveness claims de novo or deferentially (people v. johnson (1992) 3 cal.4th 1183, 1216-1217 (johnson).) we will employ de novo review. we conclude that the photo spread was not unduly suggestive, but acknowledge that it approaches that line. as vaughn correctly observes, his photo has a different color background, is cropped in slightly smaller size, and is the only one with a suspect who is smiling. on these bases, it is certainly 21 distinguishable from the others. however, our supreme court in johnson, supra, 3 cal.4th 1183, ruled that a six-person photo background color and image size among the various id. at p. 1217; see also people v. hicks (1971) 4 cal.3d 757, 764 [different background; not unduly suggestive]; accord, people v. wimberly (1992) 5 cal.app.4th 773, 790 [difference in clothing of persons in lineup; not unduly suggestive].) the sole additional difference in this case is that suggest the witness should select himyeoman, supra, 31 cal.4th at p. 124). the distinctions in this case fall far short of other cases where the photo spread was found to be unduly suggestive. (see people v. carlos photograph was the only one with a name and identification number beneath it]; passman v. blackburn (5th cir. 1981) 652 the only one in color and with front view, whereas the other 11 were black and white mug shots with front and side views].) however, even if we were to assume the photo spread was was otherwise reliable. even though the victim was first shown the photo spread a month after the shooting, the victim had ample opportunity to view vaughn because they exchanged words before vaughn opened fire, and the victim looked up at vaughn and watched him as vaughn continued to fire. the , and build was accurate, and the victim was confident that 22 iv. sufficiency of the evidence love assails the sufficiency of the evidence underlying his conviction for shooting at an occupied vehicle, and particularly would recognize that shooting at an occupied vehicle was a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the assault or conspiracy to assault that love intended to aid and abet. (chiu, supra, 59 cal.4th at p. 165.) in assessing the sufficiency of the evidence, we review the whole record in the light most favorable to the [verdict] to determine whether it discloses . . . evidence that is reasonable, credible, and of solid value . . . from which a reasonable trier of fact could find the defendant guilty beyond a people v. salazar (2016) 63 cal.4th 214, 242.) shooting at an occupied vehicle verdict was finding that love intended to, and did, aid and abet an assault or a conspiracy to assault: love drove vaughn and recruited boykins then drove vaughn into rival gang territory with boykins in tow. ave reasonably foreseen that a shooting at an occupied vehicle might result. it is well settled that a possible consequence of a fistfight between gang members is an attempted murder. (medina, supra, 46 cal.4th at p. 922; people v. olguin (1994) 31 cal.app.4th 1355, 1376; people v. godinez (1992) 2 cal.app.4th 492, 499-500.) a 23 member and, because the rival gang territory was in a densely populated urban area the probability that one or more bullets will strike the [vehicle] or persons in or around it. (overman, supra, 126 cal.app.4th at p. 1356; manzo, supra, 53 cal.4th at p. 885.) v. prosecutorial misconduct love argues that the prosecutor committed three instances of misconduct during closing argument. love did not object to two of the three instances, which would ordinarily bar him from objecting on appeal. (people v. crew (2003) 31 cal.4th 822, 839 [claim for prosecutorial misconduct forfeited unless defendant objects and seeks jury admonition].) love nevertheless asks us to reach the merits of those two claims on the ground that his trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective for not objecting; we will do so. due process under either the federal or state constitutions. conduct violates federal such unfairness as to make the conviction a denial of due people v. adams (2014) 60 cal.4th 541, 568.) conduct violates state involves the use of deceptive or reprehensible methods to attempt to persuade either the trial ibid.) these a] prosecutor is given wide latitude to vigorously argue his or her case and to make fair comment upon the evidence.people v. dykes (2009) 46 cal.4th 731, 768.) comments, we evaluate them in context (people v. dennis (1998) 24 likelihood that the jury construed or applied any of the remarks in an objectionable (people v. booker (2011) 51 cal.4th 141, 184-185 (booker)). a. diluting the presumption of innocence in her rebuttal argument, the prosecutor argued that the presumption of innocence. and as every witness came before you, and as every piece of evidence that was put into this book got presented, and all the different conclusions, reasonable conclusions, that were able to be made from the evidence you have been presented, that presumption of innocence went away, and, as he sits here today, he i gentlemen, your decision is goinwhen love objected again, evidence to take back there and to consider and to apply it to the a prosecutor commits misconduct when she misstates the law. (people v. marshall (1996) 13 cal.4th 799, 831.) as is presumed to be innocent until the contrary is proved. 1096; booker, suprato determine through its deliberations whether the evidence presented by the people has rebutted the presumption of innocence (booker, at p. 185; people v. goldberg (1984) 161 cal.app.3d 170, 189-190), a prosecutor does not misstate the law by arguing that the evidence presented at trial has rebutted 25 the presumption. (booker, at p. 183 [arguing that the people v. panah (2005) 35 cal.4th 395, 463 [arguing that the goldberg, s been proven to you . . . [t]here is no more presumption of innoall that the prosecutor did here when she argued that the ingly distinguishable from the inappropriate arguments in people v. cowan (2017) 8 cal.app.5th 1152, 1159, where the prosecutor argued read,u.s. v. perlaza (9th cir. 2006) 439 f.3d 1149, 1169, b. misstating the burden of proof in her rebuttal argument, the prosecutor explained, easonable doubt is not beyond all possible doubt. we talked have to decide. and you have to this argument did not misstate the law. a prosecutor may not tell mandate that a verdict rest upon a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. (people v. centeno (2014) 60 cal.4th 659, 673, italics omitted.) however, a prosecutor may urge the jury to e the 26 people v. romero (2008) 44 into the latter category, and not the former: she implored the beyond a reasonable doubt. c. reliance on sympathy the prosecutor began her initial closing argument, stating, proved this case beyond a reasonable doubt to you, all that means is that i have proven to you that there is violence like this in our society and that you can be struck by it at any time, unexpectedly, l she went on to argue that the shooting victim and the driver of the car that was hit in this case will never be the same for the violence that they have suffered and experienced; and none of us will be the same because we know that this ki as a (people v. fields (1983) 35 cal.3d 329, 362.) this is why it is misconduct for prosecutors to urge the jury to view a crime through the eyes of the victim. (e.g., people v. martinez (2010) 47 cal.4th 911, 957.) however, this line is not crossed simply by pointing out that the charged crime is part of a broader pattern of violence that harms society as a whole. (e.g., people v. rundle (2008) 43 cal.4th 76, 162.) and even if we assume the prosecutor crossed the line of permissible advocacy, her comments were brief and isolated in the context of a broader argument that focused on . (ibid.) the accompanied by jury 27 instructions telling the jury not to , or public opinioand not to treat the attorneys arguments as evidence. once we factor in the presumption that jurors follow the instructions they are given (people v. boyette (2002) 29 cal.4th 381, 453), any reference to of a prejudicial violation of federal or state due process. vi. sentencing issues a. -in-possession count the trial court imposed a seven-year sentence for the gang enhancement when it sentenced vaughn on the felon-in-possession of a firearm count. where, as here, the underlying crime is neither a violent nor serious felony ( 667.5, subd. (c) [felon-in-], 1192.7, subd. (c) [felon-in-]), the maximum sentence the trial court can impose for the gang enhancement is four years, not seven. ( 186.22, subd. (b)(1)(a).) the seven-year sentence is therefore in excess of the maximum for the felon-in-possession count must be modified to reduce the gang enhancement to four years. b. remand for senate bill no. 620 hearing defendants have asked for a remand for the trial court to consider its newfound discretion, pursuant to senate bill no. 620, whether to strike the previously mandatory firearm enhancement of 25 years underlying their attempted premeditated murder convictions. ( 12022.53, subd. (h), as amended by stats. 2017, ch. 682,  2.) because this statutory amendment mitigates punishment by granting discretion to strike a previously un-strike-able enhancement (in re estrada (1965) 63 cal.2d 740, 28 748-750; people v. francis (1969) 71 cal.2d 66, 75-76), defendants whose convictions are not yet finallike the defendants in this caseare entitled to its benefit. vii. cumulative error love argues that his convictions must be vacated because the cumulative effect of all of the errors he alleges so warrants. because his individual claims lack merit, their cumulative impact does not warrant reversal. (people v. mcwhorter (2009) 47 cal.4th 318, 377.) disposition the case is remanded for resentencing to allow the superior court to consider whether the enhancements under section 12022.53 should be stricken pursuant to section 1385. judgment is modified as follows: the portion of the judgment imposing a seven-year gang enhancement for possession of a firearm by a felon is modified to a four-year term, and the trial court is ordered to prepare and forward to californias department of corrections and rehabilitation an abstract of judgment modified accordingly. in all other respects, the judgments are affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. ______________________, j. hoffstadt we concur: _________________________, acting p. j. ashmann-gerst _________________________, j. chavez
