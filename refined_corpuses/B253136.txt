a man knocking on the bathroom door; benitez leaving the bathroom; kaiwi running to los angeles police department (lapd) officer arthur castro, who knew pacheco from previous contacts, viewed the surveillance video and observed a man 2 castillo was a reluctant witness. she did not want to go to court and be known as a snitch. 5 standing outside the bathroom, changing his shirt, and walking around the hallway. officer castro identified pacheco as the man in the video based upon his gait, his facial features, and his tattoos. d. arrest of pacheco on december 5, 2012, lapd officer eric hurd saw pacheco walking with another person in cypress park. when officer hurd and his partner approached pacheco, both he and the other person ran. the officers apprehended pacheco. that same day, lapd detective brian martin interviewed pacheco. pacheco dged that the person in the him. e. pacheco is known as diablo on january 24, 2013, pacheco telephoned his mother from jail. he instructed his trying to reach her. various police officers knew pacheco by the gang moniker, ii. defense evidence pacheco did not testify. discussion pacheco argues that the trial court committed reversible error when it allowed officer castro to offer his lay opinion that pacheco was the gunman in the surveillance video of the apartment complex where the shooting occurred. i. relevant proceedings testimony identifying pacheco as the person who appeared tentatively court reasoned that his opinion would be helpful in two ways: (1) pacheco was likely to 6 identification of another person from a photographic line-up, and her admission that she had been using methamphetamine all night prior to the shooting. (2) it was difficult to view the face of the person in the video because the person is wearing a hat. but, the person in the video had a distinctive walk. officer castro, who was familiar with pachecoe useful testimony. his last contact with pacheco was two years prior to the videotape. in addition, castillo identified pacheco in court. the prosecution responded that the video did not provide a clear depiction of the an adequate identification. after entertaining oral argument, the trtestimony was admissible. ii. relevant law his testimony in the form of an opinion is limited to such an opinion as is permitted by law, including but not limited to an opinion that is: [] (a) rationally based on the perception of the witness; and [] (b) helpful to a clear understanding of hadmission of lay opinion is within the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be disturbed on appeal unless a clear abuse of discretion is shown. (people v. mixon (1982) 129 cal.app.3d 118, 127.) iii. analysis allowed by evidence code section 800. first, his lay opinion was based on his own perceptions and on his familiarity with pacheco. while officer castro had not seen pacheco in two yearsfeatures. any question admissibility, of the opinion evidence. (people v. larkins (2011) 199 cal.app.4th 1059, 1067.) 7 second, the man was on the surveillance tape. (people v. perry (1976) 60 cal.app.3d 608, 611612, 614615.) although castillo identified pacheco at trial, her credibility was questionable at best. she failed to identify him prior to trial. and, she admitted to smoking methamphetamine the entire night prior to the shooting. since a credible helpful to the jury. even if the trial court had erred by allowing the opinion testimony, any error was harmless because it is not reasonably probable that the jury would have reached a more favorable result had that alleged error not occurred. (people v. bradley (2012) 208 cal.app.4th 64, 84.) we first note that the jury was admonished how to consider lay opinions during trial.3 instructions. (people v. delgado (1993) 5 cal.4th 312, 331.) and, there was overwhelming evidence of castillo testified that officers knew pacheco b moreover, while being interviewed by police, pacheco acknowledged that the man in the surveillance video had a tattoo that was identical to his own and that he could be the man depicted in the video. it follows that even if there had been error, such error was harmless. (people v. jablonski (2006) 37 cal.4th 774, 823.) 3 their opinions during the trial. you may but are not required to accept those opinions as true or correct. you may give the opinions whatever weight you think appropriate. her opinion is based, the reasons the witness gave for any opinion, and the facts or information on which the witness relied in forming that opinion. you must decide whether information on which the witness relied was true and accurate. you may disregard all or any part of an opinion that you find unbelievable, unreasonable, or 8 disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. _____________________________, acting p. j. ashmann-gerst we concur: ______________________________, j. chavez ______________________________, j. hoffstadt
