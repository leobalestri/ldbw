(a)), (3) grand theft auto ( 487, subd. (d)(1)), (4) unlawful driving or taking of a vehicle (veh. code,  10851, subd. (a)), (5) evading an officer in vehicle with willful disregard (veh. code,  2800.2, subd. (a)), (6) and (7) resisting executive officers (pen. code,  69), (8) hit-and-run driving, as a misdemeanor (veh. code,  20002, subd. (a)), and (9) and (10) receiving stolen propertyfor the purse and credit card, and for the laptops, respectively (pen. code,  496, subd. (a)). the people alleged -degree burglary conviction as a strike under our three strikes law (pen. code,  1170.12, subds. (a)-(d) & 667, subds. (b)-(i)), as a prior serious felony (pen. code,  667, subd. (a)(1)), and as a prior prison term (pen. code,  667.5, subd. (b)). the people also alleged four more prior prison terms (pen. code,  667.5, subd. (b)). the matter proceeded to trial in december 2013. the trial court dismissed the receiving stolen property count as to the purse and credit card (count 9) for insufficient evidence. the jury convicted defendant of unlawful driving or taking of a vehicle (count 4), evading an officer (count 5), resisting two executive officers (counts 6 and 7), and misdemeanor hit-and-run driving (count 8). the jury acquitted defendant of grand theft auto. the jury hung on the remaining three countsfirst-degree burglary (count 1), grand theft of the personal property (count 2), and receiving the stolen laptops (count 10). the people proceeded to a second trial in june 2014 on the three counts on which the first jury hung. the trial court dismissed the receiving stolen property count as to the laptops (count 10) for insufficient evidence. the jury convicted defendant of first-degree burglary (count 1) and grand theft of personal property (count 2), and found all of the sentencing enhancement allegations to be true. the trial court sentenced defendant to 17 years in state prison. the court treated the first-degree burglary count as the principal offense, selected the mid-term of four years, and doubled it to eight years because of the prior strike. the court imposed three consecutive terms of 16 months (one third the middle term, doubled because of the prior strike)one for the unlawful taking of a vehicle, one for evading an officer, and one for the first resisting an executive officer count. the court then added a consecutive five 4 year term because the 2010 first-degree burglary was a serious felony. the court imposed a concurrent prison term of four years on the second resisting an executive officer count and six months on the hit-and-run misdemeanor. the court stayed both the four-year sentence for grand theft of property and all five prior prison term sentences. defendant timely appeals. discussion i. challenges to conviction(s) a. defendant represented himself during the entirety of the first trial and through most of the second trial. he argues that the trial court erred in revoking his right to represent himself. ying . . . name calling and addressed witnesses, including michaels, by their first names. ons ignored those rulings by referring to evidence the court had ruled inadmissible and by telling the jury the court was preventing him from presenting relevant evidence. when the court warned defendant no fewer than seven times that it would terminate his right to self-representation if he persisted in this behavior. formation before -by counsel to take over. substantially failed to comport his behavior in conformity with the rules, regulations and order of this court despite repeated warnings throughout the trial and pre-trial, and found and create inferences of misconduct by the court and prosecutor to elicit jury sympathy the rules and ha[d] disrupted the dignity and the core and integrity of these proceedings. 5 a criminal defendant has a federal constitutional right to represent himself at trial. (faretta v. california (1975) 422 u.s. 806, 821 (farettaabuse the dignity of the courtroom [or] . . . [a] license not to comply with relevant rules id. at p. 834, -mckaskle v. wiggins (1984) 465 u.s. 168, [that] seriously threaten[s] people v. carson (2005) 35 cal.4th 1, 6 (carson); faretta, at p. 834, r to terminate self--carson, at p. 10.) in assessing whether to terminate self-representation, a trial court should consider (1) the nature of the misconduct, (2) its likely impact on the proceedings, availability and suitability of alternative sanctions,(4) whether the defendant has been warned that his continued misconduct will result in termination of self-representation, sought to disrupt and delay the trial.]carson, at p. 10.) we review a trial -representation for an abuse of discretion; we may not disturb people v. williams (2013) 58 cal.4th 197, 253, quoting people v. welch (1999) 20 cal.4th 701, 735.) -representation. defendant made repeated personal attacks on the court, refused to conduct himself according to the rules of courtroom protocol when he raised his voice and used profanityalluding to excluded evidence in front of the jury. (e.g., people v. peyton (2014) 229 cal.app.4th carson, supra, 35 cal.4th at pp. 10-21 [termination 6 courtroom].) the court many times reminded defendant of its rules and rulings and at least seven times warned defendant that the consequence for any further violation was the termination of self-cs and antics notwithstanding these reminders and warnings provided ample basis for the court to ing compromised. that his hich threatened as explained above, we disagree with both his characterization of his misconduct and his assessment of its impact on the trial. this is beside the point. because a -representation even if unintentional (carson, supra, 35 cal.4th at p. 11), there is certainly no requirement that a defendant have a specific motive for his misconduct. lastly, defendant argues that the prosecutor twice urged the court to terminate his self-representation status. although the faretta rights . . responsibility to determine the appropriate sanction (id. at p. 11, fn. 1), warned defendant five times that he might lose his self-representation status; what is more, the court did not terminate self-representation after that first request and its ultimate decision is amply supported by the record and by findings. b. instructional error defendant contends that that trial court was obligated, acquittal for grand theft auto, to instruct the jury in the second trial not to consider his theft of the bentley when assessing the grand theft count; relatedly, defendant argues that 7 his standby counsel was constitutionally ineffective for not requesting such an instruction. the information charging defendant with grand theft of personal property alleged specifically listed t the trial court read this charge to the jury at the beginning of the second trial. the jury the verdict onal property, to wit: audemars watch, hermes handbag and wallet . . . as charged in c double jeopardy precludes a defendant from being retried for a crime of which he was acquitted (ashe v. swenson (1970) 397 u.s. 436, 445-unanimously [that] the defendant is guilty of a people v. russo (2001) 25 cal.4th 1124, 1132, italics omitted). from these principles, defendant argues that the trial upon the theft of the bentley, of which he was acquitted, and that the court was obligated to discharge that duty by instructing the jury only to consider the theft of evidence other than the bentley. we review a claim of instructional error de novo. (people v. vega (2015) 236 cal.app.4th 484, 495.) that is forfeited if not requested (people v. maury (2003) 30 cal.4th 342, 394 & 397, fn. 11) because we conclude that either there was no error or that any error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. (accord, people v. diaz (2015) 60 cal.4th 1176, 1195 [instructional error subject to harmless error analysis].) that is because the trial court described to the jury, at the beginning of the trial, that the grand theft charged in this case e read people v. hajek & vo (2014) 58 cal.4th 1144, 1224), the repeat that limitation during the predeliberation charge was ostensibly not error at all. even if we assumed the court was required to give a predeliberation instruction as to 8 omission was surely harmless in trial description of that charge and the verdict form that expressly set forth the property that could be considered. defendant makes two further arguments. he argues that we may not consider the es are not in any sense evidence but the court did not tell the jury to disregard the charges or contends that the prosecutor muddied the waters by referring to the theft of the bentley during opening and closing argument. although the prosecutor mentioned the auto theft, at no point did he urge the jury to convict the defendant of grand theft because of that theft auto or even theft of the auto, but the items that because it is not error to mention past, acquitted conduct (people v. bradford (1997) 15 cal.4th 1229, 1375), and because the prosecutor said nothing nstructions and verdict form limiting which property could underlie a conviction for grand theft, we find the omission of any further instruction to be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. because the instructions were either correct or because any error in them was harmless, defendant also cannot show that the decision of his standby counsel not to request such an instruction amounted to deficient performance or otherwise prejudiced him, both of which are required to state a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel. (strickland v. washington (1984) 466 u.s. 668, 687-688 [defendant must show he was ii. challenges to sentence a. use of 2010 first-degree burglary conviction as a strike defendant asserts that the trial court erred in treating his 2010 first-degree burglary conviction as a strike because that conviction arises from a plea agreement in which the prosecutor agreed it would not constitute a strike. in may 2010, defendant was charged with four the information stated that the first-degree burglary count was 9 in june 2010, f rights, waiver, which he agreed to plead to the first-degree burglary count in exchange for a two year prison sentence to be served concurrently with the sentence on his parole violation and for the dismissal of the remaining three counts. defendant put his initials beside an advisement that read: strike offense), and i am convicted of another felony in the future, then pursuant to the three strikes laws, the penalty for that future felony will be increased as a result of my advisement of rights, waiver, first-degree burglary in exchange for a two year prison term to be served concurrently with the sentence on his parole violation as well as for the dismissal of the remaining counts and of any allegations regarding prior convictions. on this form, defendant did not inthrough it. defendant entered his plea on september 3, 2010. no transcript of the plea colloquy is available, but the minute order reflects that defendant was advised of possible consequences of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, including . . . the possible legal effects and maximum penalties incident to subsequent convictions for the same or after the first jury trial and before the second, defendant filed a motion seeking specific performance of his 2010 plea agreement. through the advisement on the second, final felony advisement form constituted a t the prosecutor was violating that only seeking to enforce specific performance of terms negotiated at the time of the first- 10 notes or plea tha2 and fair operation of the criminal justice sysof such bargains using contract principles. (people v. renfro (2004) 125 cal.app.4th 223, 230 (renfro).) enforcement of a plea agreement turns on (1) the terms of the agreement, [i]n order to be deemed a term of a plea significant degree on a promise or agreement . . . so that it can be said to be part of the inducement or consideration . . . . [cberman v. cate (2010) 187 cal.app.4th 885, 893 (bermanof advice regardinga term mentpeople v. mcclellan (1993) 6 cal.4th 367, 379, italics omittedmisadvisement regarding those consequences (in re moser counsels against a finding that she did. (people v. paredes (2008) 160 cal.app.4th 496, 511-512 (parades).) there are two remedies for a breach of (1) allowing the defendant to withdraw the plea; and, in certain circumstances, (2) specific enforcement of that term. (renfro, at p. 233.) we review the terms of a plea agreement de novo (paredes, at p. 507), and whether to specifically enforce them for an abuse of discretion (united states v. anthony (9th cir. 1996) 93 f.3d 614, 616). the consequences of this first-degree burglary conviction under the three strikes law. his conviction of first- 2 the trial court felony because defendant did not admit that a person was present. ( 667.5, subd. (c)(21) [so requiring].) 11 ( 1192.7, subd. (c)(1)(18any burglary of the first , italics added.) because a prosecutor cannot agree to ignore a statute, this counsels against a finding that the prosecutor did so. (parades, supra, 160 cal.app.4th at pp. 511-512.) more importantly, the minute order reflects that defendant was advised how the conviction might be used to enhance future criminal sentences; this is whether the sentence is to be served concurrently or consecutively, nowhere states that the conviction will not be treated as a strike in the future. defendant asks us to infer such rather thaberman, supra, 187 cal.app.4th at p. 897.) second, even if we agreed with defendant that this lone inference was sufficient to define a term of the plea agreement, he would still not be entitled to specific performance people v. brown (2007) 147 cal.app.4th 1213, 1224; accord, moser, supra, 6 cal.4th at p. 357 [declining to specifically enforce agreement altering parole term]; berman, supra, 187 cal.app.4th at pp. 893-895 [same]; people v. avila (1994) 24 cal.app.4th 1455, 1461; mcclellan, supra, 6 cal.4th at p. 380 [declining to specifically enforce agreement relieving defendant of statutory duty to register as a sex offender]; parades, supra, 160 cal.app.4th at pp. 511-512 [declining to specifically enforce agreement relieving defendant of statutory immigration consequence of conviction]; cf. davis v. woodford (9th cir. 2006) 446 f.3d 957, 962 [enforcing agreement to treat two separate charging documents as a single document for purposes of determining number of prior convictions].) because a prosecutor has no authority to disregard the statutory classification of first-people v leslie (1996) 47 specific performance is not available in this case. defendant on appeal seeks the 12 alternative remedy of withdrawal of his 2010 plea, but explicitly disavowed that remedy cable connection, inc. v. directv, inc. (2008) 44 cal.4th 1334, 1350, fn. 12). b. prior prison term enhancements defendant lastly asserts that the trial court erred in staying, rather than striking, the five prior prison term enhancements that it elected not to impose. this is correct. (people v. jones (1992) 8 cal.app.4th 756, 758.) the prior prison term for the first-degree burglary conviction must be stricken for an additional reasonnamely, it also underlies the five-people v. jones (1993) 5 cal.4th 1142, 1153.) disposition we affirm the judgment with instructions to modify the sentence to strike the five prior prison term sentences. the superior court is directed to forward a certified copy of the corrected abstract of judgment to the department of corrections and rehabilitation. as modified, the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. _______________________, j. hoffstadt we concur: ____________________________, acting p.j. ashmann-gerst ____________________________, j. chavez
