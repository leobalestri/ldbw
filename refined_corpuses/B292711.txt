filed 10/10/19 p. v. frazier ca2/2 not to be published in the official reports california rules of court, rule 8.1115(a), prohibits courts and parties from citing or relying on opinions not certified for publication or ordered published, except as specified by rule 8.1115(b). this opinion has not been certified for publication or ordered published for purposes of rule 8.1115. in the court of appeal of the state of california second appellate district division two the people, plaintiff and respondent, v. zachary frazier, defendant and appellant. b292711 (los angeles county super. ct. no. na105784) appeal from a judgment of the superior court of los angeles county. richard r. romero, judge. affirmed with directions. elana goldstein, under appointment by the court of appeal, for defendant and appellant. xavier becerra, attorney general, gerald a. engler, chief assistant attorney general, lance e. winters, senior assistant attorney general, scott a. taryle, supervising deputy attorney 2 general, nancy lii ladner, deputy attorney general, for plaintiff and respondent. * * * * * * zachary frazier (defendant) repeatedly punched a male co-worker and, when a female co-worker implored him to stop, grabbed her by the neck and slammed her against a wall while choking her. a jury convicted him of two counts of assault by means likely to cause great bodily injury and found that he inflicted great bodily injury against the male co-worker. on appeal, he argues that his convictions are defective due to two evidentiary errors and that his sentence is infirm due to three errors. only one of his arguments has merit, and requires us to remand so the trial court can decide whether to exercise its enhancement. we otherwise affirm. facts and procedural background i. facts in october 2016, defendant worked in a veterinarian hospital in long beach, california along with jose pineda (pineda), alyssa contreras (contreras) and others. defendant and pineda did not get along, so pineda asked his supervisor not to schedule him to work with defendant. this upset defendant, would be waiting for him after his shift. in the mid-afternoon of october 28, 2016, while pineda and defendant were working overlapping shifts, pineda asked defendant if he had any clean towels. defendant told pineda to defendant punched him in the face. defendant tried to land a second punch. because pineda saw it coming and ducked, this 3 pineda tried to get away by moving into the kennel room, but tripped over metal cages on the floor and fell to the ground, landing on his back. defendant continued to attack, bending over pineda and throwing punches at his head as pineda covered his face and head with his arms. a male co-worker pulled defendant away from pineda, but defendant wriggled away and returned to pineda. contreras then put her hand on defendant to stop him, against the wall, and choked her for seven or eight seconds. additional employees ran in, and separated defendant from the others. surveillance cameras caught bits and pieces of the melee, but none of the cameras had the proper angle to capture the punches or choking. substantial loss of blood and required 10 staples to close. ii. procedural background in the operative first amended information, the people charged defendant with assaulting pineda and contreras by means of force likely to cause great bodily injury (pen. code,  245, subd. (a)(4))1, and alleged that he inflicted great bodily first degree robbery conviction from washington state law ( 1170.12, subds. (a)-(d), 667, subds. (b)-(j)) as well as a prior serious felony ( 667, subd. (a)(1)). the people alleged that defendant had nine other prior prison terms for felonies ( 667.5, subd. (b)). 1 all further statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise indicated. 4 a jury convicted defendant of both counts and found the great bodily injury allegation true. admission of the washington conviction, the people dismissed the prior prison term allegations. the trial court sentenced defendant to 18 years in prison. for the assault on pineda, the court imposed 16 years, comprised of a base term of eight years (the high-term of four years, doubled bodily injury, plus five years for the prior serious felony. for the assault on contreras, the court imposed a consecutive two-year sentence, comprised of one-third the midterm of three years doubled due to the prior strike. this was the maximum sentence available, and the court imposed the maximum because defendant had an serfelon[ies] against two innocent individuals who did nothing to the trial court also ordered defendant to pay a mandatory state restitution fine of $390 ( 1202.4), a court operations fee of $40 for each of his two convictions ( 1465.8), and a criminal conviction assessment fee of $30 for each conviction (gov. code,  70373, subd. (a)(1)) a total of $530 in fines and fees. defendant filed this timely appeal. discussion i. evidentiary challenges defendant argues that the trial court erred in (1) allowing impeachment purposes after defendant asked contreras whether defendant the prosecutor to -wrack[ed] 5 , which the prosecutor asked after defendant had y tough had threatened her after assaulting pineda. we review evidentiary rulings for an abuse of discretion. (people v. clark (2016) 63 cal.4th 522, 597.) a. admission of sanitized prior convictions for impeachment 1. pertinent facts during his cross-examination of contreras, defendant asked her a series of questions regarding what defendant had said to her after the incident and to pineda during the incident as well as whether defendant had given contreras a letter to pass thought you were grabbing me so i pushed you away,pulling me from [my] shirt, and i pushed you away. y[ed her]take this or whatever. in response to an open-ended question, the court subsequenrendered defendant a hearsay declarant who could be impeached with his prior convictions involving moral turpitude. balancing and budeleting the specific crimes involved and instructed the juryduring trial and at the end of trialthat the convictions could be [no] 6 2. analysis for honesty or veraed to attack . . . the credibility of [a hearsay] declarant is admissible if it would have (id.,  1202), the credibility of a hearsay declarant may be impeachment evidence. (people v. jacobs (2000) 78 cal.app.4th 1444, 1449-1451 (jacobs); people v. little (2012) 206 cal.app.4th 1364, 1367, 1373-1376 (little); accord, people v. brooks (2017) 3 cal.5th 1, 51-52 [assuming, without deciding, that jacobs and little -of-court statement  1200id.,  135). because -of-court remorseful, defendant court did not abuse its discretion in admitting his prior convictions to impeach him. little [defendant] took it upon himself to put his hearsay declaration at issue, the prosecution was entitled to test his credibility as the little, at p. 1376.) defendant resists this conclusion with several arguments, none of which has merit. first and chiefly, he argues that jacobs and little only authorized impeachment of a hearsay declarant with his prior 7 the plain language of the statutes cited above refutes any such limitation, and the fact that jacobs and little happened to involve exculpatory (or, as in jacobs, exstatements (jacobs, supra, 78 cal.app.4th at p. 1451)) does not over-was no reason to impeach his apology because it inculpated him, but this is a relevance argument (rather than an argument about the proper methods of impeachment). this relevance argument h the people v. reeves (1966) 64 cal.2d 766, 774.) because expressions of remorse are people v. smith (2003) 30 cal.4th 581, 629), evidence relevant to impeach such an expression is all the more relevant. second, defendant asserts that he was not a hearsay declarant because his apology was not admitted for its truth. truth. he has it backwards: thexcept for its truth. third, defendant contends that the court erred in introducing his prior felony convictions to impeach him because hearsay statement, somehow waived its right to impeach that statement through introduction of his prior felony convictions. little rejected this precise argument (little, supra, 206 cal.app.4th at pp. 1376-1377), and with good reason: the elicitation of his own hearsay statement does not exempt him 8 from the consequences of that elicitation under the rules of evidence. lastly, defendant suggests that his counsel was constitutionally ineffective for eliciting his apology. although we are limited to the trial court record in evaluating this claim, the record shows that counsel made the tactical decision to attempt -of-court statements, many of which, if contreras had acknowledged them, would have exculpated him. reasonable tactical choices cannot be the basis for an ineffectiveness challenge simply because they do not work out. (people v. ochoa s counsel to make b. discomfort 1. pertinent facts contreras testified that defendant repeatedly returned to the veterinarian hospital to talk to her after the incident and that she had tried, unsuccessfully, to get a restraining order against him. on cross-examination, defendant asked whether he had [ed] -wrack[ed]courtroom. during this questioning, the prosecutor asked if feel uncomfortable the last time [she] w[as] -examination, defendant asked what his 9 know, but they were being rude and kind of just cussing at me, 2. analysis (people v. scott (2011) 52 people v. mendoza (2011) 52 cal.4th 1056, to testifyand the reasons why she felt are relevant. what is stions, on cross-examination, on the topics of [has] such evidence, . . . he is . . . in no position to complain of its reception people v. westek (1948) 31 cal.2d 469, 481.) defendant marshals a number of arguments against this conclusion, none of which has merit. he argues that a witness may be questioned about intimidation and threats only if the witness changes her story, but this argument inserts a restriction found nowhere in the cases and ignores that contreras testified denied being threatened. defendant aquestions it would ask about intimidation during redirect rendered it inappropriate to allow this questioning, but this argument would require the people to seek an exclusion order 10 that would put the convictions in jeopardy by violating that the people could not have previewed their trial strategy on this issue because that strategy waquestions on cross-examination. defendant argues that the court abused its discretion in concluding that the questioning was appropriate under evidence code section 352, but we conclude there was no abuse of discretion in the courtprobative value of those questions was not substantially outweighed by the danger of undue prejudice. and defendant argues that the prosecutor committed misconduct, but a prosecutor does not commit misconduct by asking questions that are lawful under the rules of evidence. (cf. people v. adams ii. sentencing challenges a. fines and fees defendant argues that people v. dueas (2019) 30 cal.app.5th 1157 (dueas) requires us to vacate all of his fines and fees. he is wrong. citing the constitutional guarantees of due process and excessive fines, dueas held that trial courts may not impose three of the standard criminal assessments and finesnamely, the $40 court operations assessment ( 1465.8), the $30 criminal convictions assessment (gov. code,  70373), and the $390 minimum restitution fine ( 1202.4)without first ascertaining dueas, supra, 30 cal.app.5th at pp. 1164, 1172, fn. 10.) so, defendant argues, dueas applies to the $530 in fines and fees imposed in this case. even though we have elsewhere held that dueas people v. darrick demond hicks (2019) 2019 cal.app. 11 lexis 914, *1), we need not rely on dueasidity because even if dueas were correct, the record in this case, unlike the record in dueas, indicates that defendant has the ability to pay the $530 in assessments. (cf. people v. bennett (1981) 128 cal.app.3d 354, 359-360 [remand for resentencing unnecessary (people v. hennessey (1995) 37 cal.app.4th 1830, 1837; people v. gentry (1994) 28 cal.app.4th 1374, 1376-1377.) prisoners earn wages of at least $12 per month. (dept. of corrections, operations manual,  51120.6, 51121.10 (2019).) at even this minimum rate, defendant will have enough to pay the $530 in assessments and fines in 45 months, which is long before his 18 year sentence would end (or, if the trial court elects to strike the five-year prior end). even if defendant does not voluntarily use his wages to pay the amounts due, the state may garnish between 20 and 50 percent of those wages to pay the restitution fine. ( 2085.5, subds. (a) & (c); people v. ellis (2019) 31 cal.app.5th 1090, 1093.) in light of these statutescontains evidence that defendant, at the time of his crime, was supporting his inabipeople v. gamache (2010) 48 cal.4th 347, 409), and hence no evidence that he would suffer any consequence for non-payment, a remand on this issue would serve no purpose. 12 b. calculation of custody credits defendant argues that the trial court erred in calculating the actual custody credits to which he was entitled in this case. we review this issue independently (people v. arevalo (2018) 20 cal.app.5th 821, 827), and conclude that the trial court did not err. a defendant is entitled to credit against his sentence for all be credited is attributable to proceedings related to the same subd. (b); in re joyner (1989) 48 cal.3d 487, 489.) in this case, defendant was charged by criminal complaint with the crimes underlying this case on february 1, 2017, and sentenced on september 17, 2018. this entitles him to 594 days of actual custody, along with 89 days of conduct credit (calculated as 15 felonies ( 2933.1, subd. (a))). the trial court awarded defendant precisely those credits. defendant asserts that the trial court should have started counting his custody on november 27, 2016, which is the date defendant was arrested on a different and unrelated crime. this assertion ignores that limitation, noted above, that a defendant is same con ( 2900.5, subd. (b).) c. on september 30, 2018, the governor signed senate bill 1393, which amends section 1385 to eliminate the prohibition on dismissing prior "serious" felony conviction allegations under section 667, subd. (a). ( 1385, subd. (b) (2018 ed.); sen. bill no. 13 1393 (2017-2018 reg. sess.)  2.) because this new law grants a trial court the discretion to mitigate or reduce a criminal sentence, it applies retroactively to all nonfinal convictions unless the legislature has expressed a contrary intent. (people v. francis (1969) 71 cal.2d 66, 75-78; in re estrada (1965) 63 cal.2d 740, 744-745.) our legislature has expressed no such intent in senate bill 1393. because defendant's convictions were not final when senate bill 1393 took effect on january 1, 2019, he is entitled to have the trial court exercise its newfound discretion been aware of having the discretion to do so. (people v. mcdaniels (2018) 22 cal.app.5th 420, 425.) here, there is no maximum possible sentence certainly suggests a disinclination to do so. however, the court made no express statements to that effect. to ensure that the trial court is given the full opportunity discretion, a remand is appropriate. 14 disposition the judgment is affirmed, but the matter is remanded for the trial court to consider whether to exercise its discretion under senate bill 1393. not to be published in the official reports. ______________________, j. hoffstadt we concur: _________________________, p.j. lui _________________________, j. chavez
