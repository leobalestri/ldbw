(people v. chavez (may 9, 2011, b216450) [nonpub. opn.] (chavez i).) on june 2, 2014 the supreme court held in chiu that the natural and probable consequences theory of aiding and abetting a crime cannot be the basis for convicting a defendant of first degree murder. (chiu, supra, 59 cal.4th at p. 167.) the following year chavez filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus with the supreme court seeking relief from his first degree murder conviction pursuant to chiu. the supreme court issued an order to show cause returnable in the superior court. in briefing in the superior court, the people conceded chiu error, and argued the appropriate remedy was reduction of the conviction to second degree murder. chavez contended he was entitled to a new trial as to second degree murder, and subsequently filed a motion for a new trial. the superior court as corpus conviction for first degree murder, and ordered that the people could either accept a reduction of the conviction to second degree murder or retry chavez for first degree murder under a legally valid theory. after the people elected to accept a reduction to and resentenced him to 55 years to life. 3 chavez contends on appeal that, by denying him a new trial, the trial court violated his sixth amendment right to a jury trial and the federal and state constitutional prohibitions against double jeopardy.1 chavez further contends there was insufficient evidence to support a second degree murder conviction under the natural and probable consequences theory. in his reply, chavez asserted we should vacate his conviction and remand for resentencing in light of senate bill no. 1437 (2017-2018 reg. sess.), which became effective january 1, 2019. the bill amended penal code sections 188 and 189 to limit who can be liable for murder under a theory of felony murder or the natural and probable consequences doctrine. we agree with the people that chavez must first petition the trial court for relief under senate bill no. 1437 before raising this issue on appeal. chavez contends in his supplemental brief, the people concede, and we agree remand is necessary to allow the trial court to exercise its discretion whether to impose the firearm enhancement imposed pursuant to penal code2 section 12022.53, subdivisions (d) and (e)(1). we affirm the judgment of conviction, but remand for resentencing for the trial court to decide whether to strike the firearm enhancement. 1 we initially dismissed taken from a nonappealable order. however, the supreme court granted and directed this court to vacate the dismissal order and to consider whether to reinstate the appeal. on april 12, 2018 we 2 all further statutory references are to the penal code. 4 factual and procedural background a. the information the information charged chavez with the murder of salvador deavila. ( 187, subd. (a).) the information alleged that in commission of the murder a principal personally used a firearm ( 12022.53, subds. (b), (e)(1)); a principal personally and intentionally discharged a firearm ( 12022.53, subds. (c), (e)(1)); and a principal personally and intentionally discharged a firearm causing great bodily injury or death ( 12022.53, subds. (d), (e)(1)). the information further alleged chavez committed the murder for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with a criminal street gang with the specific intent to promote, further, or assist in criminal conduct by gang members ( 186.22, subd. (b)(1)(c)); and chavez suffered a prior conviction of a violent or serious felony under the three strikes law ( 667, subds. (b)-(i), 1170.12) and two prior felony convictions for which he served separate prison terms within the meaning of section 667.5, subdivision (b). b. the evidence at trial3 on the night of june 24, 2007, deavila drove into the parking lot of tams burgers in paramount with jose maszano, antonio palomares, and fausto rojo. deavila dropped the three men off at the parking lot and drove in to find a parking space. as maszano, palomares, and rojo walked into the parking lot, a white bmw almost hit maszano. yashie navarro was driving the bmw. maszano, who was intoxicated, briefly argued with 3 our summary of the evidence is taken from our opinion in chavez i, supra, b216450. 5 navarro. maszano then leaned on the bmws rear bumper and began talking on his cell phone. chavez then walked up to maszano and told him, paramount varrio, this is my varrio. get the fuck out of , [w]e chavez punched maszano on the side of the chin and knocked him unconscious. chavez then reached for s cell phone and went through s pockets. palomares tried to push chavez away from maszano. another man approached palomares and said something like, d or dd the man then hit palomares in the nose causing him to lose his contact lens. palomares started to throw punches to defend himself. deavila left his car and headed toward the fight to help his friends. rodriguez, later identified as a gang, shot deavila. deavila collapsed and fell to the ground. rodriguez continued shooting at deavila. deavila died after receiving six gunshot wounds, including a shot to the head. detective gabriela herrera testified as a gang expert. she stated the paramount varrio 13 gang consisted of approximately 100 members who engaged in vandalism, robberies, assaults, and murders. detective herrera testified both chavez and rodriguez were members of the paramount varrio 13 gang and had numerous gang tattoos. tams burgers was within the paramount varrio 13 gang territory. based on a hypothetical mirroring the facts of the case, detective herrera testified the crime was likely committed for the benefit of a criminal street gang. 6 c. the verdict and sentence the jury convicted chavez of the first degree murder of deavila ( 187, subd. (a)), and found true the special allegations a principal personally used a firearm ( 12022.53, subds. (b), (e)(1)) and personally and intentionally discharged a firearm causing death ( 12022.53, subds. (d), (e)(1)). the jury also found true chavez committed the offense for the benefit of a criminal street gang. (chavez i, supra, b216450.) following the verdict, chavez admitted the special allegations he suffered a prior violent or serious felony conviction under the three strikes law ( 667, subds. (b)-(i), 1170.12) and served two prior prison terms within the meaning of section 667.5, subdivision (b). the trial court sentenced chavez to an aggregate term of 75 years to life. (chavez i, supra, b216450.) d. chavez i chavez contended on appeal there was insufficient under the natural and probable consequences doctrine; his trial counsel was ineffective; and the trial court committed judicial misconduct. we affirmed, explafinding that the shooting was a natural and probable that escalated into a deadly shooting by one of chavez i, supra, b216450.) 7 e. postconviction proceedings 1. chiu in 2014 the supreme court held in chiu that the natural and probable consequences theory of aider and abettor liability cannot support a conviction of first degree premeditated murder. (chiu, supra, 59 cal.4th at p. 167.) on june 15, 2015 chavez filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the supreme court in which he raised numerous claims, including that he was entitled to relief under chiu because he was convicted of first degree murder as an aider and abettor under the natural and probably consequences theory. in their informal response, the people conceded chavez was entitled to relief under chiu. on march 9, 2016 the supreme court issued an order to show cause chiu. in response to the order, the people filed a letter4 an aider and abettor under the natural and probable consaccept a reduction of the conviction to second degree murder. chavez argued in his traverse that he was entitled to a new trial, rather than a reduction of the conviction to second degree murdernatural and probable conseq on september 29, 2016 the superior court5 granted 4 the people filed a letter stating their position in lieu of a return. 5 judge william c. ryan 8 conviction, and instructed the peopreduction of the conviction to second degree murder, or elect to retry [chavez] for first degree murder under a legally valid the superior court set the matter for resentencing. 2. trial on november 3, 2016 chavez filed a motion for new trial in which he argued he could not be convicted of murder based on the natural and probable consequences theory because he was the perpetrator of the target offenses (assault and robbery), not an aider and abettor. in their opposition the people argued chavez was properly convicted of second degree murder because the shooting was reasonably foreseeable, and a natural and probable consequence of the gang confrontation. 3. modified judgment and sentence on may 18, 2017, after a hearing, the trial court6 denied a conviction of second degree murder. the court sentenced chavez on the murder count to 15 years to life, doubled under the three strikes law, plus a consecutive term of 25 years to life for the firearm enhancement ( 12022.53, subds. (d) & (e)(1)). the court imposed, but stayed, a 10-year enhancement for the gang allegation. the court sentenced chavez to an aggregate term of 55 years to life.7 6 judge arthur m. lew. 7 although the record does not reflect whether the trial court exercised its discretion to strike the prior prison term enhancements under section 667.5, subdivision (b), we presume it 9 chavez timely appealed. discussion a. second degree murder 1. aider and abettor liability a criminal defendant may be convicted of a crime either as a perpetrator or as an aider and abettor. ( abettor can be held liable for crimes that were intentionally aided and abetted (target offenses); an aider and abettor can also be held liable for any crimes that were not intended, but were reasonably foreseeable (nontarget offenses). [citation.] liability abettor liability; liability for unintentional, nontarget offenses is (in re loza (2018) 27 cal.app.5th 797, 801; accord, chiu, supra, 59 cal.4th at p. criminal conduct is guilty of not only the intended crime [target offense] but also of any other crime the perpetrator actually commits [nontarget offense] that is a natural and probable consequence with knowledge of the criminal purpose of the perpetrator and with an intent or purpose either of committing, or of encouraging or facilitating commission of, the [target] offense. (chiu, supra, 59 cal.4th at p. 161.) an aider and abettor is liable for the nontarget offense under the did because the court had previously exercised its discretion to strike the enhancements, and the aggregate term does not appear to include the one-year enhancements. 10 natural and probable consequence doctrine if a uld have or should have known that the charged offense was a reasonably foreseeable (id. at p. 162.) as an aids and abets only an intended assault, but a murder results, that person may be guilty of that murder, even if unintended, if it is a natural and probable consequence of the intended assault.id. at p. 161.) in chiu, the supreme court held that the natural and probable consequences theory of aider and abettor liability cannot be relied on to convict a defendant of first degree premeditated murder. (chiu, supra, 59 cal.4th at p. 167.) the mental state required for first degree murder is uniquely subjective and personal. it requires more than a showing of intent to kill; the killer must act deliberately, carefully weighing the considerations for and against a choice to kill before he or she completes the acts (id. at p. 166.) thus, under the natural and probable consequences theory, n between the premeditative state is too attenuated to impose aider and abettor liability for first degree murder . . . .ibid.) however, under chiuof first degree premeditated murder based on direct aiding and abetting (ibid.) 2. appropriate remedy to correct chiu error as the supreme court held in chiu, when the trial court instructs the jury on aider and abettor liability under both the direct and the natural and probable consequences theories of guilt, one of which was legally correct and one legally incorrect, 11 conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury based its verdict on the legally valid theory that defendant directly aided (chiu, supra, 59 cal.4th at p. 167.) in in re martinez (2017) 3 cal.5th 1216, 1218, the supreme court applied the same analysis to a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, explaining, that on a petition for writ of habeas corpus, as on direct appeal, chiu error requires reversal unless the reviewing court concludes beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury actually relied on a legally valid in chiu, the court of appeal concluded the record did not support direct aider and abettor liability, and on that basis to accept a reduction of the conviction to second degree murder or (chiu, supra, 59 cal.4th at p. 168.) as the chiu under our decision. if the people choose to retry the case, they may seek a first degree murder conviction under a direct aiding ibid.) in martinez, the supreme court e . . . remand with directions to enter an order granting martinez habeas corpus relief and vacating his conviction for first degree murder. if the prosecution elects not to retry martinez, the trial court shall enter judgment reflecting a conviction of second degree murder and sentence him accordingly.in re martinez, supra, 3 cal.5th at p. 1227; accord, in re loza, supra, 27 cal.app.5th at p. 808 after the filing of the remittitur, the prosecution does not retry loza solely on the premeditation and deliberation element of 12 murder . . . the trial court shall proceed as if the remittitur constituted a modification of the judgment to reflect a conviction of second degree murder and shall resentence loza in this case, the people conceded in the superior court that natural and probable consequences theory of aider and abettor liability. the superior court ordered the identical remedy imposed by the supreme court in chiu and in re martinez, vacated . . . . pursuant to chiu, the people may either accept a reduction of the conviction to second degree murder, or elect to retry [chavez] for first degree murder under a legally valid theory . . . . chavez contends the superior court violated his sixth amendment right to a jury trial by vacating his conviction for first degree murder, then entering a second degree murder conviction without first affording him a jury trial on whether he should be convicted of second degree murder. but the court followed the procedure the supreme court established in chiu and in re martinez, and we are bound by this precedent. (k.r. v. superior court (2017) 3 cal.5th [i]t is established that a holding of the supreme court binds all of the lower courts in people v. johnson (2012) 53 cal.4th 519, 527-528 [decisions of supreme court are binding on appellate courts].) moreover, the remedy the supreme court ordered in chiu and in re martinez to formulate a remedy that is tailored to redress the particular people v. booth 13 (2016) 3 cal.app.5th 1284, 1312.) by vacating the judgment as to first degree murder to permit the people an opportunity to retry chavez on a valid theory of first degree murder, the superior court did not relinquish its authority to modify the judgment to reflect a conviction of second degree murder, because second degree murder is a lesser included offense of first degree murder where both are based on the same theory of liability. (in re figueroa (2018) 4 cal.5th 576, 589 the parties agree that second degree murder is a lesser included offense of first degree murder.people v. taylor (2010) 48 cal.4th 574, 623 (taylor) included offense of first degree murder, but concluding second degree implied malice murder was not a lesser included offense of first degree felony murder]; people v. valenzuela (2011) 199 cal.app.4th 1214, 1237 [trial court properly instructed the jury on second degree murder as a lesser included offense of premeditated murder].) here, unlike taylorsecond degree murder was based on the natural and probable consequences theory of aider and abettor liability. thus, the only difference between a conviction of first and second degree murder in this case was whether rodriguez acted with premeditation and deliberation (taylor, supra, 48 cal.4th at p. 623 second degree murder is the unlawful killing of a human being with malice, but without the additional elements . . . that would support a conviction of first degree murder. under these circumstances, second degree murder is a lesser included offense of first degree murder. included offense could be affirmed, we give the prosecutor the 14 option of retrying the greater offense, or accepting a reduction to people v. kelly (1992) 1 cal.4th 495, 528; accord, people v. edwards (1985) 39 cal.3d 107, 118 [conviction tainted by error was reversed, but the prosecution had the option to retry the defendant on the same charges or accept entry of judgment for lesser included offenses bnecessarily follow that the judgment must be unconditionally people v. richards (2017) 18 cal.app.5th 549, 560-561 [same].)8 the cases cited by chavez in which the courts ordered a retrial following the grant of a habeas corpus petition that vacated the conviction are distinguishable. in each case, the court vacated the conviction based on an error that affected the validity of the verdict under any theory of liability. (see, e.g., people v. cooper (2007) 149 cal.app.4th 500, 506-507 [writ of habeas corpus granted and defendant afforded new trial where admission of testimony violated confrontation clause]; in re cruz (2003) 104 cal.app.4th 1339, 1346 [trial court should have ordered retrial after it granted new evidence that defendant may not have been the shooter in murder case].)9 here, the error affected only the degree of the murder conviction. 8 the separation of powers by deferring to the prosecution whether chavez should be convicted of first or second degree murder. under chiu, the people were entitled to an opportunity to retry the first degree murder charge under a valid theory of liability, or if they declined to retry the case, to a conviction of second degree murder. 9 chiu and in re martinez are inconsistent with united states supreme court 15 b. degree murder conviction chavez contends there was insufficient evidence to support a conviction for second degree murder under a natural and probable consequences theory. however, as chavez concedes, we previously concluded in chavez i sufficient evidence supported his first degree murder conviction under a theory of natural and probable consequences. (chavez i, supra, b216450.) as we explained, natural and probable consequence of the assault and attempted fight with maszano that escalated into a deadly shooting by one ibid.) because we determined the evidence supported a conviction of first degree murder, the same evidence necessarily supports a conviction of the lesser included offense of second degree murder.10 holding in people v. chun (2009) 45 cal.4th 1172, 1178, which jeopardy lacks merit. (see, e.g., lockhart v. nelson (1988) 488 u.s. 33, 42; green v. united states (1957) 355 u.s. 184, 189-192; people v. cooper, supra, 149 cal.app.4th at p. 522.) the cited cases did not address whether, after a finding of error in a was to vacate the conviction and enter a conviction of the lesser included offense if the prosecution elected not to retry the defendant for the greater offense. 10 because we conclude sufficient evidence supports the his appeal. 16 held a second degree felony-murder conviction cannot be based on an assaultive crime, to bar a second degree murder conviction based on the natural and probable consequences doctrine. however, the supreme court in chiu could have extended chun to convictions based on the natural and probable consequences doctrine, but it did not. (chiu, supra, 59 cal.4th at p. 166.) we are bound by this precedent. (k.r. v. superior court, supra, 3 cal.5th at p. 308; people v. johnson, supra, 53 cal.4th at pp. 527-528.) c. chavez may only seek relief under senate bill no. 1437 by filing a petition in the trial court 1. senate bill no. 1437 on september 30, 2018 senate bill no. 1437 was signed into law, effective january 1, 2019. senate bill no. 1437 was r rule and the natural and probable consequences doctrine, as it relates to murder, to ensure that murder liability is not imposed on a person who is not the actual killer, did not act with the intent to kill, or was not a major participant in the underlying felony who acted with no. 1437 (2017-2018 reg. sess.)  1; see people v. martinez (2019) 31 cal.app.5th . . . senate bill 1437 accomplishes this by amending section 188, which defines malice . . . people v. martinez, at p. 723.) as discussed, prior to the enactment of senate bill no. 1437, second degree murder could be committed by aiding and abetting a target offense, the natural and probable consequences of which could result in death.

(sen. bill no. 1437 (2017-2018 reg. sess.)  person convicted of felony murder or murder under a natural and probable consequences theory may file a petition with the court conviction vacated and to be resentenced on any remaining counts when all of the following conditions apply: [] (1) a complaint, information, or indictment was filed against the petitioner that allowed the prosecution to proceed under a theory of felony murder or murder under the natural and probable consequences doctrine. [] (2) the petitioner was convicted of first degree or second degree murder following a trial . . . .

(id. at p. 744.) in two recent cases, however, the 19 supreme court concluded as to proposition 47 (the safe neighborhoods and schools act;  1170.18) and proposition 36 (the three strikes reform act of 2012;  1170.126) the procedures under the initiatives for petitioning the trial court were the exclusive means of obtaining retroactive relief in light of relief. (see people v. dehoyos (2018) 4 cal.5th 594, 603 (dehoyos) . . . proposition 47 is an ameliorative criminal law measure that is not silent on the question of retroactivity, but instead contains a detailed set of [recall and resentencing] people v. conley (2016) 63 cal.4th 646, 657 (conley) similar set of interpretive considerations [in prior cases] persuades us that the voters who passed [proposition 36] did not intend to authorize automatic resentencing for third strike defendants serving nonfinal sentences imposed under the .) our colleagues in division five recently applied the reasoning in conley and dehoyos to the question of retroactivity of senate bill no. the legislature intended process rather than avail themselves of senate bill ameliorative benefits on direct appeal.people v. martinez, supra, 31 cal.app.5th at p. 728; accord, in re r.g. (2019) 35 cal.app.5th 141, 151 [declining to consider request for relief from second degree murder conviction under sen. bill no. 1437 on direct appeal without prior  1170.95 petition]; people v. anthony (2019) 32 cal.app.5th 1102, 1158 (anthony) [same].) as the court in people v. martinez the analytical framework animating the decisions in conley and 20 dehoyos is equally applicable here. like propositions 36 and 47, senate bill 1437 is not silent on the question of retroactivity. rather, it provides retroactivity rules in section 1170.95. the petitioning procedure specified in that section applies to persons who have been convicted of felony murder or murder under a natural and probable consequences theory. it creates a special mechanism that allows those persons to file a petition in the sentencing court seeking vacatur of their conviction and resentencing. in doing so, section 1170.95 does not distinguish between persons whose sentences are final and those whose sentences are not. that the legislature specifically created this mechanism, which facially applies to both final and nonfinal convictions, is a significant indication senate bill 1437 should not be applied retroactively to nonfinal convictions on direct appeal.(people v. martinez, supra, 31 cal.app.5th at p. 727; accord, anthony, supra, 32 cal.app.5th at p. 1152.) we agree with the reasoning of the courts in people v. martinez, in re r.g., and anthony, and likewise conclude the exclusive remedy for chavez to obtain relief under senate bill no. 1437 is to petition for relief under the detailed procedure set forth in section 1170.95. d. remand for resentencing is necessary pursuant to section 12022.53, subdivision (h) chavez contends, the people concede, and we agree remand is appropriate for the trial court to exercise its discretion whether to strike the firearm enhancements to sentence imposed pursuant to section 12022.53, subdivisions (d) and (e)(1). in 2017 the governor signed into law senate bill no. 620 (2017-2018 reg. sess.), which went into effect on january 1, 21 2018. senate bill no. 620 amended section 12022.53, subdivision (h), to give trial courts discretion to strike firearm enhancements under this section in the interest of justice.

(h), as amended by stats. 2017, ch. 682,  2.) section 12022.53, justice pursuant to section 1385 and at the time of sentencing, strike or dismiss an enhancement otherwise required to be imposed by this section. the authority provided by this subdivision applies to any resentencing that may occur pursuant the people concede section 12022.53, subdivision (h), as amended, applies retroactively to chavez, whose sentence was not final at the time the provision came into effect. (see people v. hurlic (2018) 25 cal.app.5th 50, 56; people v. billingsley (2018) 22 cal.app.5th 1076, 1080; people v. mcdaniels (2018) 22 cal.app.5th 420, 424.) nature of the offense, remand is necessary to allow the trial court to exercise the discretion it did not have at the time of sentencing.11 11 on remand, if the trial court declines to strike the firearm enhancement under section 12022.53, subdivisions (d) and (e)(1), because chavez was a principal (not the shooter), the court should strike the gang enhancement on the same count pursuant to section 12022.53, subdivision (e)(2). if the trial court exercises its discretion to strike the firearm enhancement, it may impose a gang enhancement, but the 15-year minimum parole eligibility term under section 186.22, subdivision (b)(5), would apply, which is applicable to crimes punishable by life terms, not the 10-year enhancement for violent felonies under section 186.22, subdivision (b)(1)(c). (people v. lopez (2005) 34 cal.4th 1002, 1004.) 22 disposition the judgment of conviction is affirmed. we reverse the sentence, and remand with directions for the trial court to exercise its discretion whether to impose or strike the firearm enhancements imposed pursuant to section 12022.53, subdivisions (d) and (e)(1), and to resentence chavez. feuer, j. we concur: perluss, p. j. segal, j.
