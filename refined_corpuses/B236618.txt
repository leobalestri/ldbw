(a)-(d)) and two prior narcotics convictions within the meaning of health and safety code section 11370.2, subdivision (a). 2 stand in any roadway, other than in a safety zone or crosswalk, nor shall any pedestrian walk lengthwise along and within a roadway in a manner that interferes with the lawful 3 nd placed him in the patrol car, where barajas advised him of his right to remain silent, to the presence of an attorney, and, if indigent, to appointed counsel (miranda v. arizona (1966) 384 u.s. 436 [86 s.ct. 1602, 16 l.ed.2d 694] (miranda)), which smith waived. smith then told barajas he had marijuana at home and gave the officers consent to search his house.3 evidence. according to smith, he was walking alone through the alley, when the officers sped their car through the alley and stopped. officer weise got out of the car and jogged his hands. weise brought smith to the front of the car, and had him kneel down. smith said he was not on probation or parole, and then weise patted him down. officer barajas asked smith why he was running down the alley, adding that he contemplated shooting smith at the time. barajas also told smith he was being detained because he had d smith weise placed him in handcuffs. barajas never advised smith of his miranda rights, and smith felt compelled to give the officers consent to search his home. at the conclusion of the hearing, defense counsel moved to suppress the powder cocaine as the fruit of an unlawful stop, contending (1) smith was unlawfully stopped without any reasonable suspicion because he was walking in the street in compliance 3 cannabis and $500 in cash. 4 with vehicle code section 21956,4 which preempts long beach municipal code 10.58.040; (2) smith was subjected to an impermissible pat search for weapons without articulable facts indicating he might be armed; (3) the seizure of the powder cocaine was unlawful; and (4) smith was never advised of his miranda rights, and his consent to search his home was coerced. the trial court denied the motion to suppress, concluding smith was reasonably stopped for causing a safety hazard by impeding traffic, and the ensuing pat search and seizure of powder cocaine were lawful. the court also determined the officers obtained a miranda discussion 1. standard of review in reviewing the denial of a motion to suppress, the appellate court defers to the (people v. zamudio (2008) 43 cal.4th 327, 342; people v. ayala (2000) 23 cal.4th 225, 255) and independently determines, based on relevant legal principles, whether the search or seizure was reasonable under the fourth amendment. (zamudio, at p. 342; people v. glaser (1995) 11 cal.4th 354, 362.) whether relevant evidence obtained by assertedly unlawful means must be excluded is determined exclusively by deciding whether its suppression is mandated by the federal constitution. (cal. const., art i,  28; in re randy g. (2001) 26 cal.4th 556, 561-562; in re lance w. (1985) 37 cal.3d 873, 885-890.) 4 roadway outside of a business or residence district otherwise than close to his or her left-hand edge of the roadway. [] (b) a pedestrian may walk close to his or her right-hand edge of the roadway if a crosswalk or other means of safely crossing the roadway is not available or if existing traffic or other conditions would compromise the safety of a 5 2. the traffic stop was justified on appeal, smith has omitted his challenges in the trial court to the lawfulness of the pat search and the seizure of powder cocaine in his possession. having failed to argue these points on appeal, we deem them waived or abandoned. (see breneric associates v. city of del mar (1998) 69 cal.app.4th 166, 188, fn. 8.) accordingly, there is no dispute that the warrantless seizure of powder cocaine from smith was valid, if the traffic stop, or the initial stop of smith, was lawful. a traffic stop is justified if the police officer has a reasonable suspicion a traffic violation has occurred. (whren v. united states (1996) 517 u.s. 806, 809-810 [116 s.ct. 1769, 135 l.ed.2d 89]; kodani v. snyder (1999) 75 cal.app.4th 471, 476.) smith argues the traffic stop of smith based on long beach municipal code facts justifying a reasonable suspicion that smith was walking in the street in violation of yielding the right of way to motorists as required by vehicle code section 21954, subdivision (a).5 he improperly relied on the preempted municipal ordinance to justify the traffic stop. if an objectively reasonable basis for the traffic stop exists, the stop is valid or motivation is irrelevant. (people v. valencia (1993) 20 cal.app.4th 906, 915-916; people v. miranda (1993) 17 cal.app.4th 917, 923-926; people v. uribe (1993) 12 cal.app.4th 1432, 1435-1438; see whren v. united states, supra, 517 u.s. at pp. 809, 812-813.) the officers testified smith and his companion were walking next to parked 5 roadway at any point other than within a marked crosswalk or within an unmarked crosswalk at an intersection shall yield the right-of-way to all vehicles upon the roadway 6 cars in the street rather than using the sidewalk. their conduct, which forced cars either to stop or slow down and to swerve around them, created a traffic hazard by impeding occurred, justifying a traffic stop, was supported by substantial evidence. disposition the judgment is affirmed. woods, j. we concur: perluss, p. j. zelon, j.
