( 1385.) davis timely appealed, which resulted in the first appeal in this case: case number b284324, decided by this division. davis argued two points on his first appeal. first, he argued that the carjacking conviction in count 2 must be dismissed because it is a lesser included offense of the kidnapping for carjacking conviction in count 1. we agreed and ordered the carjacking conviction dismissed. second, davis argued the case should be remanded to allow the trial court to exercise newfound discretion to strike the firearm enhancements under sections 12022.5, subdivision (c), and 12022.53, subdivision (h). we agreed and remanded the case. upon remand, the trial court recognized its newfound discretion to strike the firearm enhancements but found that articulated at court dismissed the carjacking conviction. 4 ii davis filed a notice of appeal from the december 10, 2018 hearing that took place to address the issues on remand from this court. we appointed counsel to represent davis and his counsel filed a wende brief. counsel declared he reviewed the record. counsel wrote to davis explaining his evaluation of the record. counsel further declared he advised davis of his right under wende to submit a supplemental brief. davis filed a supplemental brief on july 30, 2019. davis raises multiple issues in this brief, but all stem from the address the present appeal from the december 10, 2018 hearing. appealable issues. we have examined the entire record of the proceedings are satisfied that appointed counsel fully complied with his responsibilities in assessing whether any colorable appellate issues exist. there are no arguable appellate issues.
