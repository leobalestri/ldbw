(see health & saf. code,  11350, subd. (a).) after proposition 47 was passed, hamilton filed a petition requesting that his conviction be reduced to a misdemeanor, and that he be resentenced. (see pen. code,  1170.18.) the court granted the petition, resentencing hamilton to 364 days in county jail with credit for time served, and one year of supervised parole. (see pen. code,  1170.18, subd. (d).) on appeal, hamilton argues the trial court should have applied his excess presentence custody credits toward his one-year parole period. the supreme court recently addressed this issue in people v. morales (2016) 63 cal.4th 399 (morales), holding that excess credit for time served does not reduce the one-year parole period described in section 1170.18, subdivision (d). because morales resolves the issue before us, we affirm. factual background in 1998, the district attorney filed an information against marques hamilton alleging possession of a controlled substance in violation of health and safety code section 11350, subdivision (a). the information further alleged that hamilton had two prior convictions under the three strikes law. (see pen. code,  667, subds. (a)-(i), 1170.12, subds. (a)-(d).)1 hamilton was found guilty of the offense, and both priors were found to be true. the court sentenced hamilton to 25 years to life in prison. on february 23, 2015, hamilton filed a petition pursuant to proposition 47 requesting that his third-strike offense be reduced to a misdemeanor, and that he be resentenced. (see  1170.18, subd. (a).) following a hearing, the trial court granted and reduced his crime to a misdemeanor. the court resentenced hamilton to 364 days in jail, awarding 364 days of presentence custody credits. the court also ordered one year of supervised parole pursuant to section 1170.18, subdivision (d). his excess presentence 1 unless otherwise noted, all further statutory citations are to the penal code. 3 custody credits should be deducted from the supervised parole period. the trial court denied the request. discussion the sole argument hamilton raises on appeal is that the trial court was required to apply his excess custody credits toward his one year parole period, resulting in no period of parole. as discussed in more detail below, the california supreme court recently considered and rejected this same argument in morales, supra, 63 cal.4th at pp. 405-406. a. summary of proposition 47 and penal code section 1170.18 on november 4, 2014, the voters enacted proposition 47, the safe neighborhoods and schools act (hereafter proposition 47), which went into effect the next day.

[] as amended by proposition 47, health and safety code section 11350 now provides that a violation of that section is a misdemeanor, unless the defendant has been previously convicted of any felony specified in section 667, subdivision (e)(2)(c)(iv). (rivera, supra, 233 cal.app.4th at pp. 1091-1092.) proposition 47 also created a new resentencing provision: section 1170.18.(rivera, supra, 233 cal.app.4th at p. 1092.) under subdivision (a) of this provision, any person curr for an offense that is now a misdemeanor under proposition 47 may petition for a recall of that sentence and request resentencing in accordance with the statutes that were added or amended by proposition 47.ibid.) if the petitioner falls within the category of persons described in subdivision 4 (a), subdivision (b) requires the trial court to recall the felony sentence, and resentence him or her to a misdemeanor unless the court, in its discretion, determines that resentencing the petitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. subdivision (d) further provides that person who is resentenced pursuant to subdivision (b) shall be given credit for time served and shall be subject to parole for one year following completion of his or her sentence, unless the b. the trial court did not err in imposing one year of supervised parole hamilton argues that the trial court was required to apply his s custody meaning the number of days by which his time served in prison exceeded his misdemeanor sentenceagainst the one year period of parole imposed under section 1170.18, subdivision (d), which would have resulted in no period of parole. he relies on section 2900.5, which the defendant is entitled to credit for time served; and (2) such credit can be applied toward any period of imprisonment  2900.5, subds.

(id. at p. 403.) on appeal, the defendant argued that the trial court was required to apply his excess custody credits toward the one-year parole period set forth in section 1170.18, subdivision (d). the court of appeal agreed, concluding that section 2900.5 required the trial court to apply any excess custody credits toward the one-year period of parole. the supreme court reversed, concluding that although section 2900.5 ordinarily requires excess custody credits to be applied toward any period of parole in the . . . situation of original sentencing, the statute does not apply to resentencings conducted under proposition 47. (morales, supra, 63 cal.4th at p. 405.) the court explained that n its face,section 1170.18, subdivision (d) requires persons who are resentenced under proposition 47 to one-year pars discretion to order otherwise. [the statute] states that the person shall receive credit for time served and shall be subject to parole.ibid. [emphasis in original].) the court further explained that if, as the court of appeal had concluded, section 2900.5 was deemed to apply to proposition 47 resentencings, ould] be reduced or eliminated in many of the cases that section 1170.18 governs. persons receiving a misdemeanor sentence under section 1170.18 will have been serving a felony sentence and, therefore, will often have substantial excess credit for time served. in those cases, if excess credits can reduce or eliminate s discretion will be curtailed or eliminated. s conclusion s discretion in many cases.ibid.) the supreme court also noted that even if section 1170.18, subdivision (d) seemingly mandatory . . . language [wa]s ambiguous,the ballot materials concerning proposition 47 ffenders who are resentenced would be required to be on state parole for one year, unless the judge chooses to remove that requirement.
