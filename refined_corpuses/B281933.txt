(a); counts 1-3)2 and one count of possession of a firearm by a felon ( 29800, subd. (a)(1); count 5). as to counts 1 through 3, it was alleged that defendant used and personally and intentionally discharged a handgun ( 12022.53, subds. (b)-(d)), a principal used and personally and intentionally discharged a handgun ( 12022.53, subds. (b)-(e)), and the murders were committed for the benefit of, at the direction of, and in association with a criminal street gang with the specific intent to promote, further, and assist criminal conduct by gang members ( 186.22, subds. (b)(1) & (b)(5)). as to counts 1 through 3, a special circumstance was alleged that defendant committed multiple murders within the meaning of section 190.2, subdivision (a)(3). as to count 1, a special circumstance was alleged that defendant killed the named victim while lying in wait, within the meaning of section 190.2, subdivision (a)(15). defendant pled not guilty and denied the special allegations. the jury found defendant guilty as charged. it also found all allegations and special circumstances to be true. the trial 1 defendant was charged with codefendants leon panting (panting) and jerry wilson (wilson) on count 1 and javier pellecer (pellecer) on counts 2 and 3. ever was granted. defendant was tried alone after panting and wilson entered plea agreements. 2 all further statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise indicated. 3 court sentenced defendant to two consecutive terms of life without the possibility of parole (lwop) plus 100 years to life in state prison, including three 25-year enhancements that were imposed under section 12022.53, subdivision (d). defendant timely filed a notice of appeal. we affirm. factual background the october 6, 2008, murders of columbus campbell (campbell) and kavette watson (watson) the rolliapproximately 2,000 members. their primary activities include robberies, burglaries, homicides, and vandalism. members of the gang are known to murder each other to gain respect and prestige. the gang has a slogan related to these in-house campbell was also a rollin . in september 2008, defendant was involved in a fight with campbell in the presence -sided shot and cut defendant suffered a black eye. campbell won the fight. on october 6, 2008, defendant asked pellecer, a fellow agreed. they found campbell sleeping in a parked car with watson on 63rd street and crenshaw boulevard. pellecer pulled a white mercedes. defendant got 4 out of the car and shot campbell and watson. pellecer then los angeles police department officer thomas callen arrived at the scene. he saw the white mercedes with the they both had been shot in the head. the police recovered 11 .40-caliber casings and an expended bullet. a gang expert opined that a hypothetical crime based on the facts of campbthe benefit of, at the direction of, and in association with the status in the gang and benefitted the gang by instilling fear and intimidation in the community. june 2, 2013, murder of charles westby (westby) in the apartment complex, including defendant, wilson, and panting. defendant, wilson, and panting were all members of claimed dorset village as its territory. westby lived in dorset village, but he was not a member of a gang. on june 2, 2013, wilson noticed that defendant looked irritated and asked defendant what was wrong. defendant stated that he was with three other individuals in the apartment defendant and westby had an argument. defendant told westby to leave. westby pulled a gun on defendant. westby pointed the gun at defendant; he pulled the trigger, but the gun did not fire. 5 wilson tried to calm defendant down, but was unsuccessful. defendant stated that he was going to kill westby. panting arrived, and defendant devised a plan to murder westby. f the westby was on his way back to the back of the apartment complex. they walked towards a tree in the middle of dorset village. at some point, the two men separated, but wilson heard panting call westby down.3 wilson then borrowed another dorset where westby was, and wilson told him. five to seven seconds after defendant hung up the phone, wilson heard six to seven -4 los angeles police department officer jose bonilla arrived at the scene; westby was visibly injured and taken to the hospital. he later died from his injuries. a gang expert opined that a hypothetical crime based on the facts of the murder of westby was committed for the benefit because defendant felt disrespected when westby pulled a gun on ritory. everyone who participated in the 3 brenda dobbins (dobbins), a neighbor in dorset village, testified that she heard panting call out to westby. 4 dobbins also testified that she heard the gunshots and then saw westby laying on the ground. 6 murder had their gang status elevated. the gang benefitted by instilling fear and intimidation in the community. subsequent events shortly after the murders, defendant visited queron (battey) apartment in dorset village. defendant asked battey for a drink, and battey invited him inside. battey gave bedroom. five minutes later, battey went to the bedroom. defendant was praying. battey and defendant then had a conversation during which defendant told battey that he had murdered westby, and detailed how he had committed the murder.5 meanwhile, on october 16, 2013, pellecer was detained by police and placed in a jail cell with a confidential informant (ci). pellecer explained to the ci how he and defendant had murdered campbell and watson. he also admitted to getting rid of the gun used by defendant to murder westby. (see people v. pellecer (sept. 18, 2018, b280333) [nonpub. opn.], at pp. 68.) on february 9, 2017, wilson reached a plea agreement. he spoke to the police and provided the details of the westby murder. at trial, he also testified that defendant admitted to killing campbell and watson and detailed the events surrounding westby 5 frances campbresidence on june 2, 2013, when defendant showed up, approximately 15 minutes after she heard gunshots. defendant walked few minutes, battey went into the bedroom. battey told frances westby was 23 years old when he was murdered. 7 defense evidence defendant rested without testifying or providing an affirmative defense. discussion i. the trial court properly omitted jury instructions on accomplice -of-court statements were not defendant contends that the trial court erred by failing to instruct the jury (calcrim nos. 301 & 335) that pellecer was an accomplice and thus his statements had to be viewed with caution and required corroboration. a. on october 16, 2013, pellecer was placed in a jail cell with a ci, during which time pellecer made a host of admissions regarding his involvement with the crimes at issue. (people v. pellecer, supra, b280333, at pp. 68.) alled as a witness. he refused to take the oath or make any statement. the trial court found him in contempt of court. a transcript of his statements to the ci was given to the jury. the statements were admitted as declarations against penal interest. b. other evidence tying defendant to the murders multiple persons testified at trial. although they could not identify defendant as the shooter, two witnesses provided zamora (zamora) described the shooter as a black man; he was tall, slim, and his hair was braided or in a ponytail. dumoris preuitt (preuitt) likewise testified that the passenger in the car that pulled up next to the parked mercedes was a black man with braided hair. at the time of the murders, defendant had 8 long hair that he wore in a ponytail. when defendant was arrested, the police listed his height as 6 feet 2 inches, and his weight as 180 pounds. in around 2011 or 2012, wilson had a conversation with defendant. defendant told wilson that he suffered a black eye as []he then told wilson that he c. -of-court statements to the ci were not subject to the corroboration requirement for accomplice statements because they were properly admitted as statements against penal interest testimony of an accomplice unless it be corroborated by such other evidence as shall tend to connect the defendant with the commission of the offense; and the corroboration is not sufficient if it merely shows the commission of the offense or the ludes out-of-court statements (people v. williams hand, when the out-of-court statements are not given under suspect circumstances, those statements do not qualify as . . . section people v. williams, supra, at p. 245.) the trial court properly admitted peevidence under the hearsay exception for statements against penal interest. (evid. code,  1230.) unquestionably, pellecer 9 was unavailable (he refused to testify), and his statements to the ci were against his penal interest.6 moreover, his statements to the ci were sufficiently reliable to warrant admission despite their hearsay character. (people v. duarte (2000) 24 cal.4th 603, 610whether the declaration passes the required threshold of trustworthiness, a words but the circumstances under which they were uttered, the people v. cudjo (1993) 6 cal.4th 585, 607.) here, pellecer made his confession in a noncoercive setting to an individual he thought was a fellow inmate. (people v. greenberger (1997) 58 cal.app.4th 298, 3circumstance is one in which the conversation occurs between friends in a noncoercive setting that fosters uninhibited he took responsibility for his role as the driver in the murders of campbell and watson. he never denied his involvement in the killings. and his statements to the ci contained specific details of the crimes. under these and reliable. (people v. arauz (2012) 210 cal.app.4th 1394, 1399, 1401; people v. arceo (2011) 195 cal.app.4th 556, 575577.) 6 defendant of the murder weapon for defendant was not against his penal interest. we disagree. that statement was made against ( 32; people v. nguyen (1993) 21 cal.app.4th 518, 536.) 10 because the trial court properly admitwas necessary, and the [trial] court was not required to instruct people v. brown (2003) 31 cal.4th 518, 556.) d. any alleged instructional error was harmless even if the trial court had erred by failing to instruct on people v. brown, supra, 31 cal.4th at p. 556.) there is ample corroborating evidence in the record. (ibid.) zamora and preuitt each provided a description of the shooter that matched defendant. and defendant admitted to wilson that he had committed the murders. ii. the trial court properly exercised its discretion when it denied and 3 defendant argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion to sever trial of the murder of westby (count 1) from the murders of campbell and watson (counts 2 & 3). a. relevant proceedings defendant moved to sever count 1 from counts 2 and 3. he argued that a trial on all three counts would likely confuse the jury; the evidence on count 1 was strong, but the evidence on counts 2 and 3 was weak; the double murder charged in counts 2 confession and gang testimony, there was no other cross-admissible evidence. the prosecution opposed the motion. o sever. 11 b. applicable law charge two or more different offenses connected together in their commission, . . . or two or more different offenses of the same class of crimes or offenses, under separate counts, . . . provided, that the court in which a case is triable, in the interests of justice and for good cause shown, may in its discretion order that the different offenses or counts set forth in the accusatory pleading favors the joinder of counts because such a course people v. scott (2015) 61 cal.4th 363, 395 (scott); see also people v. thomas (2011) 52 cal.4th 336, 349350; alcala v. superior court (2008) 43 cal.4th 1205, 1220 ause consolidation or joinder of charged offenses ordinarily promotes efficiency, that is the course of action preferred by the when the threshold statutory requirements for joinder to establish that the trial court abused its discretion in denying defendant must demonstrate the denial of his motion exceeded people v. capistrano (2014) 59 cal.4th 830, 848, overruled in part on other grounds in people v. hardy (2018) 5 cal.5th 56, 104.) abuse of discretion where: (1) evidence on the crimes to be jointly tried would not be cross-admissible in separate trials; (2) certain of the charges are unusually likely to inflame the jury against the defendant; (3) a several charges might well alter the outcome of some or all of the 12 charges; and (4) any one of the charges carries the death penalty determining whether denial of the severance motion was an abuse of discretion, we examine the record before the trial court scott, supra, 61 cal.4th at pp. 395396.) c. analysis applying these legal principles, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying defento sever count 1 from counts 2 and 3. joinder of the three murders was proper under section 954 because the offenses are  954; see also people v. thomas (2012) 53 cal.4th 771, 798.) and, even if there was error defendant has not shown prejudice. (alcala v. superior court, supra, 43 cal.4th at p. 1220.) some of the evidence would have been cross-admissible in separate trials. (id. at p. (or so-called two-way) cross-admissibility is not requi as defendant agrees, trials. furthermore, been admissible7 in both trials because he provided details of the murders of campbell and watson and stated that he disposed of the murder weapon used to kill westby. (people v. armstrong (2016) 1 cal.5th 432, 456 [if there is evidence that is cross-admissible, that factor alone is normally sufficient to dispel any allegation of prejudice].) 7 statements were cross-admissible. 13 if the evidence underlying these charges would not be cross-admissible in hypothetical separate trials, that determination would not itself establish prejudice or an abuse of discretion by the trial court in declining to sever properly joined people v. soper (2009) 45 cal.4th 759, 775; see also alcala v. superior court, supra, 43 cal.4th at p. 1221.) a reviewing court must then consider whether: (1) some charges are likely to unusually inflame the jury against the defendant, (2) a weak case has been joined with a strong case or another weak case so that the total evidence may alter the outcome of some or all of the charges, and (3) one charge is a capital offense or the joinder converts the prosecution into a capital offense. (people v. soper, supra, 45 cal.4th at p. 775.) here, the crimes were not unusually likely to inflame the jury against defendant.8 the murder of westby and the murders of campbell and watson were similar in nature and equally egregious. they all involved defendant shooting unsuspecting victims after defendant felt slighted. neither case was likely to unduly inflame the jury against him. (people v. soper, supra, 45 cal.4th at p. 780.) relying upon williams v. superior court (1984) 36 cal.3d 441 (williams), superseded in part by statute as stated in people v. jones (2013) 57 cal.4th 899, 927, and people v. ybarra (2016) 245 cal.app.4th 1420, 1435, defendant argues that the combination of multiple gang-related murders resulted in extreme prejudice. williams is readily distinguishable. in that case, the defendant was charged in two separate murders, and 8 we note that defendant agrees that each of the murders 14 his participation in the killings was unclear. (id. at pp. 444445.) participation in all three murders. he was the shooter and ringleader in all three murders. moreover, nothing in the appellate record indicates that a weak case was joined with a strong case (or two weak cases were put together). in fact, both cases here were strong. on count 1 (murder of westby), wilson testified as to the events surrounding the murder. battey testified that defendant confessed to the and, pellecer told the ci that he got rid of the murder weapon for defendant. (people v. pellecer, supra, b280333, at p. 8.) on counts 2 and 3, pellecer provided the details of the murders to the ci. (people v. pellecer, supra, b280333, at pp. 68.) those details were corroborated by wilson, who testified that defendant admitted killing campbell and watson. all of this evidence confirms that neither case was weak. finally, the joinder did not convert the matter into a capital case. iii. defendant argues that inadmissible. we disagree. a. confrontation clause is concerned solely with hearsay statements that are testimonial, in that they are out-of-court analogs, in (people v. cage for purposes of the confrontation clause, a statement 15 been given and taken primarily for the purpose ascribed to testimonyto establish or prove some past fact for possible use in ibid.) of the people v. arauz, supra, 210 cal.app.4th at p. 1402.) b. bruton rule bruton9 rule. (see people v. aranda (1965) 63 cal.2d 518.) the bruton rule provides that the confrontation clause generally prohibits people v. fletcher (1996) 13 cal.4th 451, 455.) but bruton was decided nearly four decades before crawford v. washington (2004) 541 u.s. 36 (crawford), which set forth a fundamentally new framework for determining when hearsay statements violate the confrontation clause, a paramount. (see whorton v. bockting (2007) 549 u.s. 406, 420 [finding that crawford confrontation clause protection against the admission of unreliable out-of-court nontestimonial and that the confrontation clause an out-of-court even if the statement lacks reliability].) defendant contends that the bruton rule applies even when al. however, as defendant notes, the california supreme court and various courts of appeal have concluded otherwise. (see, e.g., people v. 9 bruton v. united states (1968) 391 u.s. 123 (bruton). 16 cortez (2016) 63 cal.4th 101, 129; people v. gutierrez (2009) 45 nial hearsay people v. gallardo (2017) 18 cal.app.5th 51, 6668; people v. arceo, supra, 195 cal.app.4th at p. 575; people v. arauz, supra, 210 cal.app.4th at pp. 14011402.) not only are we bound by our supholding (auto equity sales, inc. v. superior court (1962) 57 cal.2d 450, 455), we opt to agree with our colleagues in the courts of appeal. c. defennot violate his right to confrontation, he was denied due process because he did not have the opportunity to cross-examine pellecer. it is well-provisions of the state evidence code law does not implicate a people v. jones (2013) 57 cal.4th 899, 957.) d. the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting 1230 for the reasons set forth above, the trial court did not evidence code section 1230 as statements against penal interest. e. harmless error in any event, any alleged error in admitting pellstatements to the ci was harmless under any standard as to the murder of westby (count 1). (people v. watson (1956) 46 cal.2d 818, 836; chapman v. california (1967) 386 u.s. 18, 24.) aside in the 17 westby murder, there was overwhelming evidence that defendant committed the murder. dobbinsstatement to the westby before the shooting. battey testified that defendant confessed to testimony that defendant confessed to the murder. cell phone of the murder when it occurred. given all of this evidence, any alleged error was harmless as to count 1. iv. the matter is not remanded to allow the trial court to exercise its discretion to strike the firearm enhancements -year enhancements that were imposed under section 12022.53, subdivision (d), on counts 1 through 3 for personally and intentionally discharging a firearm, causing death. defendant contends that the matter should be remanded to allow the trial court to exercise its discretion to strike the firearm enhancements. the people agree. although defendant correctly points out that the newly amended section 12022.53, subdivision (h), which allows a trial court discretion to strike or dismiss an enhancement at sentencing, applies to him and this case, we decline to remand this case for resentencing; the appellate record shows that there is no reasonable possibility that the trial court would exercise its discretion to lessen the sentence. (people v. gutierrez (1996) 48 cal.app.4th 1894, 1896.) prior to sentencing defendant, the trial court noted that s were overlook. i mean, when you kill three people, there are serious 18 -abiding people. [] . . . [] shooting people, gunning people down as they are sleeping in a carand the young woman, the 16 year-old and then setting up mr. westby so that you come upon him, and he hin wait to kill him, what is that? [] most people go through life, they have fights with people, are slighted by others. [] if every time somebody offended me i would resort to violence or get a gun and kill them, and everybody acted that way, the slaughter oneverywhere would be immeasurable. there would be piles of bodies everywhere. because wbeing offended from time to time by others. [] but it does not justify killing people. [] . . . [] and the court finds that these crimes involve great violence, bodily harm or threat of great bodily harm. [] the victims were defenseless and unsuspecting. [] the defendant used a firearm at the time of the offenses. as in the westby murder, the defendant induced others to participate in the crime. andincluding a minor. [] and the carrying out of the crime, especially in the westby murder, indicated planning, sophistication and professionalism. [] the defendant has served a prior prison term. [] all of these things are circumstances in aggravation; there are no circumstances in mitigation. 19 express consideration of factors in aggravation and mitigation, its pointed comments on the record [and its imposition of lwop], there appears no possibility that, if the case were remanded, the trial court would exercise its discretion to strike the enhancement altogether. we therefore conclude that remand in these circumstances would serve no people v. mcvey (2018) 24 cal.app.5th 405, 419.) disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. _________________________, acting p. j. ashmann-gerst we concur: _________________________, j. chavez _________________________, j. hoffstadt
