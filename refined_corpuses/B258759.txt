(pen. code,  664/187, subd. (a).)1 the jury found true the allegation that the attempted murder was willful, deliberate and premeditated, and that defendant personally used a deadly and dangerous weapon, a shank, in the commission of the offense. ( 12022, subd. (b)(1).) the jury also convicted defendant in count 3 of assault on a peace officer ( 245, subd. (c)), and found that defendant personally used a deadly and dangerous weapon, a shank, in the commission of the offense ( 667 & 1192.7).2 as to both counts, the jury found true that defendant committed the offenses for the benefit of, at the direction of, and in association with a criminal street gang. ( 186.22, subd. (b).) in a bifurcated proceeding, the trial court found defendant had suffered two prior convictions under the three strikes law ( 667, subds. (b)-(i) & 1170.12, subds. (a)-(d)), and two prior serious or violent felony convictions ( 667, subd. (a)(1)). defendant was sentenced to a total of 61 years to life in state prison. in count 2, the court imposed a sentence of 25 years to life, plus two five-year enhancements pursuant to section 667, subdivision (a)(1), and a one-year enhancement pursuant to section 12022, subdivision (b)(1). in count 3, the court imposed a sentence of 25 years to life.3 various fines and fees were imposed, including a $300 restitution fine ( 1202.4, subd. (b)) and a stayed $300 parole revocation fine ( 1202.45). defendant contends the trial court violated his due process rights by failing to remove two jurors and that there is insufficient evidence to support his conviction in count 3 of assault on a peace officer with a deadly weapon. defendant further contends 1 all statutory references are to the penal code, unless otherwise indicated. 2 defendant was found not guilty in count 1 of murder. ( 187, subd. (a).) 3 the prosecutor requested that the trial court not impose the one-year 3 the restitution fine and parole revocation fine must be amended to reflect the minimum amount as intended by the trial court. we conclude the trial court acted within its discretion in maintaining the two jurors on the trial and substantial evidence supports the assault on a peace officer conviction. we agree, and the attorney general concedes, that the restitution fine and parole revocation fine must be modified to reflect a minimum restitution fine pursuant to sections 1202.4 and 1202.45 in accordance with the trial statement of facts4 central jail at the 1700 module. the inmates housed in that module were placed in single-inmate cells. deputy felix was escorting inmate cleamon johnson from cell 15 to the shower in cell 1. defendant was housed in cell 13 and inmate jose renteria was in cell 12. as deputy felix walked by cell 13, defendant thrust a makeshift spear tipped with a razor blade at inmate johnson. defendant thrust his spear more than five times. inmate renteria also repeatedly thrust another makeshift spear tipped with a razor from his cell. neither of the spears struck deputy felix or inmate johnson, but they did come within 10 inches of deputy felix near his abdomen and head. the spears came within a johnson, pushed past the cells, and put him into cell 1. deputy felix testified that if he had not moved, he would have been struck by a spear.5 4 we only recount the statement of facts as to the assault on a peace officer charge in count 3, as the other charges are not relevant to the issues raised on appeal. 5 a video of the incident was played at trial. we have reviewed the video in connection with the appeal. 4 discussion jurors defendant contends the trial court should have removed juror no. 4 because he feared for his safety and also expressed removed alternative juror no. 1 based on her intent to secure an immediate flight to china after her grandmother passed away the day before. we hold the trial court not abuse its discretion by leaving them on the jury for deliberations and verdict. relevant facts the jury began deliberating on friday, august 1, 2012, at 3:13 p.m., and recessed at 3:45 p.m. on the following monday morning, the court held a sidebar discussion was in the hospital and the court intended to excuse him. the court further stated juror juror no. 4 was brought before the court and addressed outside the presence of the balance of the jury. the court stated that juror no. 4 expressed some concern for his safety in serving as a juror on this case. the court reassured juror no. 4 that juror identifying information is sealed and no one can get that information without a court order. tover 272 murder trials -- [] -- ation. 5 the court explained to juror no. 4 that he would not be excused from the case. to 12 jurors. what me, the law goes out of its way to protect jurors decide the case. your job as a juror, and you took an oath, is to judge the case fairly on juror no. 4 inquired what a good reason was to be excused. the court stated, had a stroke yesterday and went into good reason. consider their opinions, to give your own opinions, and to hopefully come to a verdict. if l even started deliberating. you got the case friday at 3:30 or somethinthe law expects that jurors will fairly evaluate the evidence in light of their reason and required that you come to a verdict. it is required that you deliberate openly and fully 6 and completely and in good faith with other jurors. [] and so give it a chance. i think ing -- can reach a verdict, fine. if you c in the presence of the jury, the court excused juror no. 12 and replaced him with the only remaining alternate, alternative juror no. 1. alternate juror no. 1 immediately stated that her grandmother passed away the day before and she needed to travel to china as soon as possible, however, she has not booked a ticket yet. she further stated that if the travel agency does not contact her later that evening, she will take the 12:40 p.m. flight the next day. a situation where there would be a rush to judgment based on she wants to get out of here jurors to make an appropriate assessment of the evidence. nate juror no. 1 was now seated as juror no. 12.6 the court instructed the jury to begin deliberations anew. the reconstituted jury reached verdicts later that day, including finding defendant not guilty of murder in count 1. 6 all further references to alternate juror no. 1 will now be juror no. 12. 7 analysis 108if at any time, whether before or after the final submission of the case to the jury, a juror dies or becomes ill, or upon other good cause shown to the court is found to be unable to perform his or her duty, or if a juror requests a discharge and good cause appears therefor, the court may order the juror to be discharged . . . the . . . ultimate decision whether to retain or discharge a juror[ ] rests within the sound discretion of the trial court. [citation.] if any substantial evidence exs exercise of its discretion pursuant to section 1089, the s a (people v. bradford (1997) 15 cal.4th 1229, 1351.) s inability to perform must appear ademonstr (people v. lucas [(1995)] 12 cal.4th [415,] 489.)people v. sattiewhite (2014) 59 cal.4th 446, 485-486.) other ground for discharge fails. in people v. navarette (2003) 30 cal.4th 458, 500, our supreme court held that the trial court had not abused its discretion in declining to his property, he was therefore biased against defendant, requiring his removal. the record belies this assumption. the court specifically asked the jurors to report if they could no longer be fair and unbiased, and [the juror in question] did not pursue the matter een affected in some way likely to be influenced. (id. at p. 500; see in re hamilton (1999) 20 cal.4th 273, 306.) hereclosely, and admonished him at some length. juror no. 4 did not indicate any further problem with his ability to perform his duties as a juror and asserted his impartiality. no 8 contention that juror no. 4 expressed an inability to deliberate with fellow jurors is unsupported by the record. the trial court instructed juror no. 4 that it was his job to evaluate the evidence in light of reason and common sense, and to collaborate with the nability to deliberate is inadequate to establish his disqualification as a matter of law. t abused its discretion by failing to excuse the juror under section 1089. in people v. beeler (1995) 9 cal.4th 953, 986-991, our supreme court concluded there was no abuse of discretion where, after two days of deliberation, the jury returned a verdict less than an hour after being told that the court would recess proceedings for nearly a week to been interpreted by the jury as suggesting that the court would limit the duration of the deliberations or we emphasize, again, that the record belies any suggestion of juror bias. to the contrary, the jury acquitted defendant of the most serious charge in the casemurder, as alleged in count 1 of the information. the trial court acted within its discretion in deciding not to remove juror nos. 4 and 12 from the jury. sufficiency of the evidence defendant contends the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction in count 3 for assault on a peace officer with a deadly weapon.7 he challenges the 7 scommits an assault with a deadly weapon or instrument . . . or by any means likely to produce great bodily injury upon the person of a peace officer . . . and who knows or reasonably should know that the victim is a peace officer . . . engaged in the performance 9 sufficiency of evidence to support the requisite intent. hen considering a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence to support a conviction, we review the entire record in the light most favorable to the judgment to determine whether it contains substantial evidencethat is, evidence that is reasonable, credible, and of solid valuefrom which a reasonable trier of fact could find the people v. avila (2009) 46 cal.4th 680, 701.) (people v. medina (2009) 46 cal.4th 913, 919.) unwarranted substantial evidence people v. zamudio (2008) 43 cal.4th 327, 357 (zamudiosubstantial evidence includes circumstantial evidence and the reasonable inferences flowing therefrom. [citation.]people v. ugalino (zamudio, supra, same when the prosecution relies mainly on circumstantial evidence. (people v. valdez (2004) 32 cal.4th 73, 104.) the crime of assault with a deadly weapon on a peace officer ( 245, subd. (c)) (see people v. colantuono (1994) 7 cal.4th 206, 213-214 (colantuono).) thus, we begin our analysis with the applicable legal standard for assault. awful attempt, ( 240.) not require proof of injury. (colantuono, at p. 216.) of his or her duties, when the peace officer . . . is engaged in the performance of his or her duties, shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for three, four, or five 10 regarding the mental state required for an assault or assault with a deadly weapon, the defendant had the specific intent to injure the victim. (colantuono, supra, 7 cal.4th at pp. 215-216; people v. williams (2001) 26 cal.4th 779, 784 (williams).) a defendant sufficient to establish that his act by its nature will probably and directly result in physical force being applied to another, i.e., a battery. [citation.] in other words, a defendant guilty of assault must be aware of the facts that would lead a reasonable person to realize that a battery would directly, naturally, and probably result from his or her (williams, supra, at p. 788.) t]he test of natural and probable cons and s subjective state of mind. (id. at p. 790.) was no reasonable likelihood that a battery of [deputy] felix would directly, naturally substmental state for assault on a peace officer with a deadly weapon. defendant committed intentional acts (thrusting a makeshift spear tipped with a razor), and a reasonable person would know that such acts would probably and directly result in a battery upon deputy nson would have been stabbed by the spear. based on these facts, the record contains amply evidence actions, and therefore to support a finding of assault on a peace officer with a deadly weapon. 11 fines the trial court imposed a $300 restitution fine pursuant to section 1202.4, and imposed and stayed the same amount pursuant to section 1202.45. the attorney general concedes, and we agree, that the abstract of judgment be modified from $300 to $280 for both the restitution fine and parole revocation fine. it is clear that the trial court intended to impose the minimum possible restitution fines. the court stated as $300. minimum. the parole revocation fine is $300, but stayed until such time, if ever, the 2013 crimes was $280, not $300, which was in effect at the time of his 2014 sentencing. ( 1202.4, subd. (b)(1) [the restitution fine shall be no less than $280 starting on january 1, 2013, and $300 starting on january 1, 2014]; see  1202.45, subd. (a) [the court shall assess an additional parole revocation fine in the same amount as imposed pursuant to section 1202.4, subdivision (b)].) we therefore direct the court to modify the abstract of judgment accordingly. (see, e.g., people v. souza (2012) 54 cal.4th 90, 143 [restitution order applying law in effect at the time o, rather than applicable at the time of the crimes in 1993 violated ex post facto clause].) 12 disposition the trial court is directed to prepare a corrected abstract of judgment to reflect a restitution fine of $280 pursuant to section 1202.4, and the imposition and suspension of a parole revocation fine in the same amount pursuant to section 1202.45. the court shall forward a certified copy of the amended abstract of judgment to the department of corrections and rehabilitation. in all other respects, the judgment is affirmed. kriegler, j. we concur: turner, p. j. mosk, j.
