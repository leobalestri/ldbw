(people _______________________________________________________ 1 all further statutory references are to the penal code unless indicated otherwise. 2 defendant served in the united states navy in 1972 and 1973, during which time he experienced combat and witnessed defense service medal, the vietnam service medal with one bronze star, and a combat action ribbon. 3 see people v. superior court (romero) (1996) 13 cal.4th 497 and section 1385. 3 v. johnson (mar. 22, 2001, b141948) [nonpub. opn.]; see people v. johnson (nov. 16, 1999, b123526) [nonpub. opn.].) in 2014, defendant filed a motion to dismiss his prior strikes and to be placed on probation in an appropriate treatment program, pursuant to section 1170.9.4 the motion was denied on the ground that defendant had failed to establish prima facie grounds for relief. (people v. johnson (aug.17, 2016, b261443) [nonpub. opn.].) in january 2019, defendant filed a petition in pro. per. to recall his sentence and for resentencing pursuant to section 1170.91. on january 29, 2019, the matter was before the court for consideration of the petition. no court reporter, attorneys or parties were present at the hearing. the trial court denied the hearing. the mitigating factors contemplated by ab 865 were 1998.barred from making a motion for resentencing under section 5 defendant filed a timely notice of appeal from the order. _______________________________________________________ 4 section 1170.9 applies only to military veterans who otherwise qualify for probation. (see  1170.9, subd. (b).) two prior felony convictions render a defendant ineligible for probation. ( 1203, subd. (e)(4).) 5 section pertains to juvenile sentencing, and there is no subdivision (a)(1)(a) in section 1170.19. it is probable that the court meant to refer to section 1170.91, subdivision (b)(1)(a), which we discuss within. 4 discussion defendant contends that t failure to comply with the hearing procedure mandated by section 1170.91, subdivision (b)(3), requires reversal and remand for hearing. respondent agrees. section 1170.91 was enacted in 2014. (see stats. 2014, ch. 163,  2.) as amended in 2018, subdivision (b) of the statute provides in relevant part, as follows: (b)(1) a person currently serving a sentence for a felony conviction, . . . who is, or was, a member of the united states military and who may be suffering from . . . traumatic brain injury, post-traumatic stress disorder, substance abuse, or mental health problems as a result of his or her military service may petition for a recall of sentence, before the trial court that entered the judgment of conviction in his or her case, to request resentencing pursuant to subdivision (a) if the person meets both of the following conditions: (a) the circumstance of suffering from . . . traumatic brain injury, post-traumatic stress disorder, substance abuse, or mental health problems as a result of the persons military service was not considered as a factor in mitigation at the time of sentencing. (b) the person was sentenced prior to january 1, 2015. this subdivision shall apply retroactively, whether or not the case was final as of january 1, 2015. 5 (3) upon receiving a petition under this subdivision, the court shall determine, at a public hearing held after not less than 15 days notice to the prosecution, the defense, and any victim of the offense, whether the person satisfies the criteria in this subdivision. at that hearing, the prosecution shall have an opportunity to be heard on the petitioners eligibility and suitability for resentencing. if the person satisfies the criteria, the court may, in its discretion, resentence the person following a resentencing hearing. (see people v. ledesma (1997) 16 cal.4th 90, 94-95.) he concludes that the resentencing in a noticed public hearing. he asks that he be afforded the opportunity, as required by the statute, to be heard regarding his eligibility and suitability for resentencing, based upon emerging research into traumatic brain injury, and to present evidence of the condition. directory, depending upon the intent of the legislature. (people v. ledesma, supra, 16 cal.accused is entitled to the benefit of every reasonable doubt in questions of statutory constructionpeople v. casillas (2001) 92 cal.app.4th 171, 178.) the 1170.91 and has not been judicially construed. however, tatutes are not to be read in isolation, but must be construed with related statutes. [citation.] when legislation has been judicially construed and a subsequent statute on a similar subject uses identical or substantially similar language, the usual 6 presumption is that the legislature intended the same construction, unless a contrary intent clearly appears. in re jerry r. (1994) 29 cal.app.4th 1432, 1437.) here, section 1170.9 is related to section 1170.91, as it involves a similar subject, providing for probation and treatment for current members or veterans of the united states military when the defendant is suffering from traumatic brain injury, post-traumatic stress disorder, substance abuse, or mental health problems . . . as a result of his or her service. 1170.9, subd. (a).) the former section 1170.9 have been construed as mandatory rather than permissive. (see, e.g., people v. abdullah (1992) 6 cal.app.4th 1728, 1735; people v. bruhn (1989) 210 cal.app.3d 1195, 1199.) the words appear in the present version of section 1170.9, which was last amended in the same legislation which first enacted section 1170.91. (stats. 2014, ch. 163,  1 & 2.) we may infer from these both statutes to be mandatory. (see people v. ledesma, supra, 16 cal.4th at pp. 100-101.) we thus agree with court shall determine, at a public hearing notice . . . whether [defendant] as the trial court was not aeligibility for resentencing without a noticed hearing, we reverse the order and remand for a hearing in compliance with section 1170.91, subdivision (b)(1)(3). disposition january 29, 2019, is reversed, the matter is remanded, and the superior court is directed to comply 7 with the procedural mandates of section 1170.91, including a with not less than 15 days notice to the prosecution, the defense, and any victim of the offense. not to be published in the official reports. ____________________________, j. chavez we concur: __________________________, p. j. lui __________________________, j. hoffstadt
