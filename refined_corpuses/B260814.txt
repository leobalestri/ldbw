(see people v. superior court (henkel) (2002) 98 cal.app.4th 78, 84; people v. jackson [(1983)] 143 cal.app.3d 627, 631.)(italics omitted.) in the trial court, it is every element of an alleged sentence enhancement. (people v. delgado (2008) 43 cal.4th 1059, 1065; people v. tenner, supra, 6 cal.4th at p. 566.) this includes the section 667.5, subdivision (b) prior prison term enhancement and the absence of a . (people v. fielder, supra, 114 cal.app.4th at p. 1232; people v. elmore (1990) 225 cal.app.3d 953, 959-960.) on appeal we considerhether a reasonable trier of fact could have found that the prosecution sustained its burden of proving the enhancement beyond a reasonable doubt. in that regard, in conformity with the traditional rule governing appellate review, we must review the record in the light ([people v. elmore, supra, 225 cal.app.3d] at pp. 959-people v. fielder, supra, 114 cal.app.4th at p. 1232; accord, people v. rodriguez (2004) 122 cal.app.4th 121, 129.) here, the information alleges a single prior prison term enhancement based on case no. va098455. a bench trial was held on the prior prison term allegation. the prosecution presented evidence defendant was sentenced on september 18, 2007, for being a felon in possession of a firearm in case no. va098455. (former  12021, subd. (a)(1), now  29800, subd. (a)(1).) the only evidence on the subject shows defendant was paroled on november 19, 2008. the five- commenced when defendant was released from prison and placed on parole. ( 667.5, subd. (d); people v. 4 fielder, supra, 114 cal.app.4th at pp. 1232-1233; people v. nobleton (1995) 38 cal.app.4th 76, 85-85.) defendant committed the present offenses on january 27, 2014, five years, two months after he was paroled in case no. va098455. thus, defendant remained free of prison custody and the commission of an offense resulting in a felony conviction for more than five years. the evidence was insufficient to support the section 667.5, subdivision (b) prior prison term enhancement. on appeal, the attorney general relies for the first time on a felony conviction in case no. ga091723 to prove defendant did not remain free for five years of both prison custody and the commission of a new offense resulting in a felony conviction. the preconviction report. however, the prosecution offered no evidence with respect to case no. ga091723 in the trial court in support of a prior prison term enhancement. and, defendant made no admission concerning case no. ga091723. thus the prosecution new offense in case no. ga091723.
