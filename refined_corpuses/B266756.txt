filed 7/28/16 p. v. elliott ca2/2 not to be published in the official reports california rules of court, rule 8.1115(a), prohibits courts and parties from citing or relying on opinions not certified for publication or ordered published, except as specified by rule 8.1115(b). this opinion has not been certified for publication or ordered published for purposes of rule 8.1115. in the court of appeal of the state of california second appellate district division two the people, plaintiff and respondent, v. forriss lawrence elliott, defendant and appellant. b266756 (los angeles county super. ct. no. ma064792) appeal from a judgment of the superior court of los angeles county. kathleen blanchard, judge. affirmed. rachel varnell, under appointment by the court of appeal, for defendant and appellant. kamala d. harris, attorney general, gerald a. engler, chief assistant attorney general, lance e. winters, senior assistant attorney general, susan sullivan pithey, supervising deputy attorney general, andrew s. pruitt, deputy attorney general, for plaintiff and respondent. * * * * * * 2 forriss l. elliott (defendant) appeals his felony convictions of driving under the influence of alcohol and driving with a blood-alcohol content of 0.08 percent or higher. he argues that his trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective for not objecting when the us to review the transcript of the in camera hearing reviewing law enforcement personnel records. we conclude that any ineffectiveness did not prejudice defendant, and that the trial court complied with the procedures set forth in pitchess v. superior court (1974) 11 cal.3d 531 (pitchess). accordingly, we affirm. facts and procedural background on august 23, 2013, defendant was pulled over driving a u-haul truck. he smelled of alcohol, and a preliminary alcohol screening device indicated that his blood-alcohol content was 0.203 percent and 0.208 percent, more than twice the 0.08 percent legal limit. under the influence in a month and his fourth in the past six years. in the operative, first amended information, the people charged defendant with (1) driving under the influence of alcohol, as a felony because he had three prior convictions for the same crime in the last 10 years (veh. code,  23152, subd. (a) & 23550), and (2) driving with a blood-alcohol content of 0.08 percent or higher, as a felony because he had three prior convictions for the same crime in the last 10 years (veh. code,  23152, subd. (b) & 23550).1 2008 conviction for making criminal threats (pen. code,  422) was a strike within the meaning of our three strikes law (pen. code,  667, subds. (b)-(j) & 1170.12, subds. (a)-(d)). prior to trial, defendant filed a motion asking the trial court to review the puties who pulled him over. the 1 the people also charged defendant with misdemeanor assault and battery (pen. code,  242), but dismissed that count prior to trial. 3 of one of the deputies for incidents involving dishonesty, but c the court conducted an in camera hearing, reviewed the be disclosed to the defense. on the day before trial, defendant made an oral motion asking the trial court to strike the three strikes law allegation pursuant to people v. superior court (romero) (1996) 13 cal.4th 497. he argued that the charged crimes were a product of his alcoholism, -medicacancer. the court denied the motion. outside of the statutory scheme of the [three strikes law]fter conviction and [probation] violation after [probation] the court nevertheless denied the motion without prejudice, acknowledging [] due to -alcohol content, the court would consider whether the facts adduced at trial painted a different picture. before the jury returned its verdict, defendant waived his right to have the jury decide the truth of the strike allegation. the jury then found defendant guilty of both charged crimes and found the allegations of his prior driving under the influence offenses to be true. the court then discharged the jury. thereafter, the people filed a second amended information alleging that ion for assault with a deadly weapon (pen. code,  245, subd. (a)(1)) also constituted a strike under the three strikes law. on the second amended information. defendant did not object to the filing of the second amended information. the court found both prior strike allegations to be true. defendant again asked the court to strike the two three strikes allegations under romero on chiefly the same grounds as his pretrial, oral motion. the court denied this second romero 4 law in terms of the revolving door of the criminal justic the court further noted that it would have, at most, stricken the allegation with respect to the 1990 conviction but that doing so would not affect the sentence dictated by the three strikes law. the trial court then sentenced defendant to four years in state prison. as to the driving under the influence count, the court selected the mid-term sentence of two years and doubled it to four years under the three strikes law. the court imposed the same sentence on the driving with a blood-alcohol content of 0.08 percent or greater count, but stayed that sentence pursuant to penal code section 654. defendant timely appeals. discussion i. ineffective assistance of counsel defendant argues that his trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective for not second amended information, which alleged a second strike offense under the three strikes law, because the amended pleading was filed after his jury was discharged. a criminal defendant makes out a claim that his s performance was deficient [because it] fell below an objective standard of reasonableness unprofessional errors, the result would have been more favorable to [the] (richardson v. superior court (2008) 43 cal.4th 1040, 1050, quoting in re ross (1995) 10 cal.4th 184, 201.) as explained below, defendant has arguably established that his him. in people v. tindall (2000) 24 cal.4th 767, our supreme court reconciled the ging subdivision (b), osecution may amend an 5 information to add alleged prior convictions . . . tindall, at p. 776.) however, tindall repeatedly emphasized the prosecution could add new prior conviction allegations at any time prior to sentencing if the defendant did not object. (id. at pp. 774, second amended information in this case thus precludes defendant from challenging the new strike allegation in that pleading, but ostensibly constitutes deficient performance because a tindall-based objectionhad it been madewould have been well taken.2 because she may have had a tactical reason for not objecting (e.g., people v. mai (2013) 57 cal.4th 986, 1009), but we need not definitively resolve that issue because defense coutactical or notdid not prejudice defendant. defendant concedes that did not affect his sentence under the three strikes law. since the three strikes reform act of 2012 became effective, a court mamany prior strikes he may have. (pen. code,  667, subds. (e)(1), (e)(2)(c) & 1170.12, subds. (c)(1), (c)(2)(c).) the prescribed by law. (ibid.) because the two driving under the influence offenses defendant law required the court to double the sentence for these offenses whether he had one prior strike or two. defendant nevertheless argues that the trial court might have granted his romero motion had there been only one prior 2 tindall objection, the error was not prejudicial because, as explained below, there is no reasonable probability that the error affected his sentence. (people v. watson (1956) 46 cal.2d 818, 836-837.) 6 the court would have granted his motion (people v. howard (1987) 190 cal.app.3d 41, 47-48, citing strickland v. washington (1984) 466 u.s. 668, 693-694), but must prove people v. almanza (2015) 233 cal.app.4th 990, 1006-1007). here, we know whether the court would have granted a romero motion when defendant was charged with only one strike because the court denied that very motion prior to twithout prejudice and that it would consider the evidence presented at trial, defendant does not argue that the facts established at trial were any less egregious than the court anticipated them to be before trial. deadly weapon conviction was part of the criminal history the court referenced, whether or not it was later alleged to be a strike. the fact that the court had no compunction in denying trial romero motion also soundly refutes assertion that it is romero motion when only one strike was at [] in sum, we conclude that there is no possibility, let sentence would have been different had his 1990 conviction not been alleged as a strike.3 ii. pitchess motion we conducted a review of the in camera proceedings in the manner contemplated by the decision in people v. mooc (2001) 26 cal.4th 1216, 1228-1230, and found the record to be adequate to permit meaningful appellate review. (see people v. prince (2007) 40 cal.4th 1179, 1285-1286.) we have independently determined from the entire record including the sealed in camera proceedings that the trial court properly exercised 3 indeed, because the abstract of judgment does not reference the 1990 conviction as a strike, there is no basis for ordering any correction of that document either. 7 its discretion in determining which items to disclose and did not err in refusing to disclose further materials. disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. _______________________, j. hoffstadt we concur: _______________________, p.j. boren _______________________, j. chavez
