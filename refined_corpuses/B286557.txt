(pen. code,  182, subd. (a)(1), stats. 1989, ch. 897,  15.) he admitted the offense involved more than four kilograms of cocaine. (health & saf. code,  11370.4, subd. (a)(2), stats. 1992, ch. 680,  1.) the trial court sentenced defendant to eight years in state prison. 1 further statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise noted. 3 the trial court that heard the present motion. the court 15, 1996, there was a seizure of 543 kilograms of cocaine in this los angeles county. [] five defendants were arrested. all ended up pleading to various charges. a codefendant, filaberto rodriguez, agreed to cooperate. he took a ten-year sentence. aljach, . . . one of the lead defendants, was sentenced to 18 years and agreed to cooperate. a defendant named ruiz took an eight-year sentence . . . [a]nd [defendant] entered a plea and took an eight- after serving his sentence, defendant, according to his general contends defendant was deportable and therefore ineligible for voluntary departure after serving his sentence. when defendant filed the present motion, he was residing in las vegas, nevada.2 more than 20 years after defendant entered his plea, on august 15, 2017, defendant filed this motion to vacate the judgment and allow him to withdraw his plea. there is no evidence deportation or other federal immigration proceedings have been initiated against defendant. defendant did not appear at the hearing on his motion citing a fear of arrest by federal immigration authorities. defendant did not attend the hearing 2 it appears defendant entered the country illegally in 1980, and again after his conviction and sentence. the trial court 4 even though the prosecution, in its written opposition to -examine him.3 iii. discussion a. section 1016.5 effective january 1, 1978, section 1016.5, subdivision (a), requires that, prior to accepting a guilty or no contest plea, the trial court must advise the defendant on the record about the 3 it is well established that a defendant in a criminal case may not testify by way of a hearsay declaration while refusing to be cross-examined as to the same matter. (people v. gurule (2002) 28 cal.4th 557, 605; people v. edwards (1991) 54 cal.3d 787, 820; people v. harris (1984) 36 cal.3d 36, 69; people v. williams (1973) 30 cal.app.3d 502, 509-known rule that no witness, even a defendant in a criminal case, will be permitted to testify concerning a matter while refusing cross-people v. williams, supra, 30 cal.app.3d at p. 510.) this is because by testifying in his own defense a defendant waives his federal and state constitutional privilege against self-incrimination to the extent of the permissible scope of cross-examination. (people v. saddler (1979) 24 cal.3d 671, 679; people v. perez (1967) 65 cal.2d 615, gives him not only this choice [of testifying to his own version of the facts] but, if he elects to testify, an immunity from cross-examination on the matters he h(people v. williams, supra, 30 cal.app.3d at p. 510.) 5 potential immigration consequences of the plea.4 here, the trial court concluded defendant was not adequately advised before he entered his plea to a deportable offense.5 because defendant was not adequately advised, the trial to vacate the judgment and permit defendant to withdraw his plea unless, after considering relevant evidence offered by the parties, the court concluded it was not reasonably probable defendant would have rejected the plea if properly advised. (people v. martinez (2013) 57 cal.4th 555, 559.) the burden is on the moving 4 conviction of the offense for which you have been charged may have the consequences of deportation, exclusion from admission to the united states, or denial of naturalization pursuant to the 5 possible effects of plea on any alien/citizenship/probation/parole deportation, exclusion from the united states, or denial of on the same date, november 19, 1996, the trial court on the understand that if you are not a citizen[] of the united statesthese are felony pleasyou could subject yourself to being deported as a result of enter-the-record advisement did not comply with section 1016.5. at the the trial courtwhich had presided over the criminal proceedings against defendant in 1996 and accepted acknowledged that defendant was not properly advised. 6 defendant to establish prejudice. (people v. arriaga (2014) 58 cal.4th 950, 963; people v. martinez, supra, 57 cal.4th at p. 559.) relief will be granted under section 1016.5 only if the defendant meets that burden. (people v. martinez, supra, 57 cal.4th at pp. 558-was reasonably probable he or she would not have pleaded guilty if properly advised. [citation.] [] . . . [t]he question is what the defendant would have done ibid.) relief is also available if the defendant establishes he or she would have rejected the existing bargain to attempt to negotiate a bargain that would not result in deportation. (id. at p. 559.) [moving party] must provide a declaration or testimony stating that he or she (people v. martinez, supra, trial court to determine whether the defecredible, and the court may reject an assertion that is not supported by an explanation or other corroborating ibid., accord, people v. arendtsz (2016) 247 cal.app.4th 613, 617.) a presented to it by the parties, such as the presence or absence of other plea offers, the seriousness of the charges in relation to the immigration consequences, and whether the defendant had reason to believe that the charges would allow an immigration-people v. martinez, supra, 57 cal.4th at p. 568.) our review is for an abuse of 7 discretion. (people v. superior court (zamudio) (2000) 23 cal.4th 183, 192; people v. arendtsz, supra, 247 cal.app.4th at p. 617.) in his declaration in support of his motion, defendant stated he had recently consulted an immigration attorney and learned for the first time his conviction prevented him from achieving lawful status in this country. moreover, he further averred that if properly advised he would not have pled guilty. he had been living in this country for 16 years, was married to a united states citizen, and had four young children born here. defendant stated that at a minimum he would have requested time to consult an immigration attorney and confer with the prosecution. the trial court concat if properly advised he would not have pled guilty was not credible. the court had presided over this case in 1996 and accepted he circumstances for defendant to accept the plea deal and there was no likelihood immigration concerns would have prevented defendant from entering his plea. the court observeddeal, and the deal was he took 8 years instead of getting the 20 that the court believes he probably would have been convicted of and been sentenced to, which was a very reasonable decision by him, i felt, at the time. [] . . . [] i think, while the advisement attered. i not have entered his plea if properly advised. i think he 8 understood that he was looking at between 8 years and the 20 years being offered, and i think he made the rational choice and took the 8 years. the court further observed that potential the court concluded it was not reasonably probable defendant would have rejected the plea if advised he would be deported and excluded from admission to the united states. there was no abuse of discretion. the credibility determination was for the trial court to make. moreover, the actual amount of cocaine defendant conspired to possess, transport, and sell. the parties agree it was a large amount, . the trial court recalled that 543 kilograms of cocaine were seized. defendant faced at least 20 years in prison. he declined an initial offer of 18-20 years. he subsequently accepted an eight-year deal. his ccepted similar deals. there was no evidence the prosecution would have offered defendant a plea deal that avoided the immigration consequences. there is no evidence that any codefendant pled to a non-deportable offense. defendant had entered this country in 1980. there was no evidence that he had sought legal status during the 16 years prior to his conviction in 1996. defendant took no action to remedy his immigration status until 2017, more than 37 years after he first entered the country and more than 20 years after he entered his plea. these facts support the trial when defendant entered his plea, given how serious the charges were, and the fact that he could receive a long prison sentence if he went to trial (and still 9 potentially be deported), he would not have been swayed by an advisement about the immigration consequences he potentially faced. in his briefs on appeal, defendant does not address the trial , defendant would have accepted the plea deal. instead, defendant argues the trial turned on whether defendant would have obtained a more favorable outcome had he chosen not to plead guilty. in martinez, our supreme court held this was not a proper basis for denying a section 1016.5 motion. (people v. martinez, supra, 57 cal.4th at pp. 559, 564.) question is whether the defendant would have rejected the plea (id. at p. 568.) he trial court reasoning was properly focused on what, if properly advised, defendant would have done. b. section 1473.7 effective january 1, 2017, section 1473.7 extends a right to relief from a guilty or no contest plea to a person no longer incarcerated, including one who is subject to removal proceedings by federal immigration authorities due to a conviction or longer imprisoned or restrained may prosecute a motion to vacate a conviction or sentence for either of the following reasons: [] (1) the conviction or sentence is legally invalid due to a prejudicial error meaningfully understand, defend against, or knowingly accept the actual or potential adverse immigration consequences of a 10 italics added.) the burden to establish prejudicial error and a right to relief rests with the defendant. ( 1473.7, subds. (a), (e)(1); people v. perez (2018) 19 cal.app.5th 818, 829.) pursuant to conviction or sentence if the moving party establishes, by a preponderance of the evidence, the existence of any of the grounds here, defendant claimed his trial attorney was ineffective, which prevented him from understanding and defending against potential adverse immigration consequences. ineffective to meaningfully understand, defend against, or knowingly accept the actual or potential adverse immigration consequences of a plea of guilty or 73.7, subd. (a)) is error that if proven entitles a defendant to relief under section 1473.7. (people v. olvera (2018) 24 cal.app.5th 1112; people v. ogunmowo ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant must demonstrate objective standard of reasonableness under prevailing professional norms and that he (people v. ogunmowo, supra, 23 cal.app.5th at p. 75; accord, people v. olvera, supra, 24 cal.app.5th at p. 1116.) our review is de novo. (people v. olvera, supra, 24 cal.app.5th at p. 1116; people v. ogunmowo, supra, 23 mixed question of fact and law. [citations.] we defer to the trial 11 . . . but exercise our independent judgment to decide whether the facts demonstrate deficient people v. olvera, supra, 24 cal.app.5th at p. 1116.) however, we need not resolve [i]f it is easier to dispose of an ineffectiveness claim on the ground of lack of sufficient prejudice . . . that course should bstrickland v. washington (1984) 466 u.s. 668, 697.) we turn to the question of prejudice. defendant has not established prejudice. there was no evidence had he been properly advised about immigration consequences, he would have declined the plea offer. the trial court, based on its experience with the case, disbelieved defendant. defendant faced at least 20 years in prison and agreed to accept an eight-year offer. there is no evidence that any of d-deportable offense. defendant had taken no action to remedy his immigration status during the 16 years prior to his plea, or 20 years after his conviction. we conclude defendant has failed to establish that he would have rejected the plea offer had his counsel properly advised him about the immigration consequences of his plea. c. subdivision (d) of section 1473.7 statesbe entitled to a hearing. at the request of the moving party, the court may hold the hearing without the personal presence of the moving party if counsel for the moving party is present and the 12 court finds good cause as to why the moving party cannot be added.) good cause is a question that rests in see people v. sakarias (2000) 22 cal.4th 596, 646 [continuance motion].) our review is for an abuse of that discretion. (ibid.) defendant was not present at the hearing on his motion but by federal immigration authorities. the trial court disagreed.6 we need not consider whether the trial court abused its discretion because defendant was not prejudiced by the trial 6 counsel]: due to recent media information that the immigration has been a problem being in county courthouses, including los see any agents here, do you?

[] 13 absence, the trial court, with defense counsproceeded to hear the matter on the merits. the court conducted a hearing at which it considered the briefs and evidence and heard argument from counsel. this, in our view, is the very nature of the hearing afforded by section 1473.7. (cf. people v. duvall (1995) 9 cal.4th 464, 485 [evidentiary hearings required where rose v. superior court (2000) 81 opportunity to present live testimony, examine former defense counsel, orally argue the case, and respond to any concerns by the d. continuance coun[y]our honor, would the court reserve its decision and give me a moment to speak to the family to see if we could get him to come the trial court responded: defendant asserts it was an abuse of discretion to not continue the hearing. pursuant to section 1050, subdivision (e), tion. (people v. fuiava (2012) 53 cal.4th 622, 650.) our review is for an abuse of that discretion. (ibid.) defendant bears the burden of establishing an abuse of discretion. (ibid.14 abused only when the court exceeds the bounds of reason, all ibid.) dered the briefs, the evidence, and heard argument from counsel. the trial court issued an extensive oral ruling. it was only after the first requested a continuance. counsel did not explain what purpose would be served by having defendant appear and testify at that point. the trial court could reasonably conclude the request came too late.7 7 would have testified the contbold omitted.) there was no evidence to that effect. defendant was on notice the prosecution sought to cross-examine him and nevertheless stated he would not attend the hearing. 15 iv. disposition penal code sections 1473.7 and 1016.5. not to be published in the official reports kim, j. we concur: baker, acting p.j. moor, j.
