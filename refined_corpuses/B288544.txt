(a), 664),1 inflicting corporal injury on a spouse ( 273.5, subd. (a)), assault with a deadly weapon ( 245, subd. (a)(1)), assault by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury ( 245, subd. (a)(4)), possession of a firearm by a felon ( 29800, subd. (a)(1)), aggravated mayhem ( 205), and torture ( 206). the people alleged hill personally inflicted great bodily injury under circumstances involving domestic violence ( 12022.7, subd. (e)) and personally used a deadly or dangerous weapon (alcohol and fire) ( 12022, subd. (b)(1)). the people also alleged hill had served a separate prison term for a felony within the meaning of section 667.5, subdivision (b). b. the people introduce evidence of a prior act of domestic violence by hill at trial the prosecutiact of domestic violence in 2009 against ashley hassan. in that incident police responded to a 911 call regarding an unresponsive person and arrived to find hill kneeling over hassan and 1 undesignated statutory references are to the penal code. 4 performing cpr. hassan was taken to the hospital, but she did not survive. when investigators initially questioned hill, hill said he was smoking marijuana with his friends outside his apartment and saw hassan on the floor inside the apartment. she had urinated on herself, and he asked her if she was okay. when she nodded yes, hill went back outside to finish smoking marijuana. when he returned minutes later, hassan was unresponsive. he called 911. hill, however, changed his story about the 2009 incident ltimately admitted he fought with hassan because she had spilled milk on his shirt. after hassan locked him out of the apartment and hit him several times with an umbrella, hill punched her, and she fell to the floor. when hill asked hassan if she was all right and she said she was, hill went back outside. hill assumed hassan was fine because a year and a half earlier, after an argument, hill hit hassan, hassan fell down woke returned this time, however, hassan was unresponsive. hill pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter as a result of the 2009 incident. c. the jury convicts hill, and the trial court sentences him the jury found hill guilty of inflicting corporal injury on ebony, aggravated mayhem, and torture and acquitted him of attempted murder. the jury also found true the allegations he inflicted great bodily injury and used a deadly and dangerous weapon. the court dismissed the other charges (assault with a deadly weapon, assault by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury, and possession of a firearm by a felon) in furtherance of justice under section 1385. 5 the trial court sentenced hill on his conviction for aggravated mayhem to a prison term of life with the possibility of parole, plus one year for the use of a deadly or dangerous weapon. under section 654 the court stayed execution of the sentences im discussion a. aggravated mayhem hill contends substantial evidence did not support the that, as required for aggravated mayhem, he specifically intended to maim ebony. there was substantial evidence, however, to support that finding. 1. standard of review the evidence on appeal, we review the whole record in the light most favorable to the judgment below to determine whether it discloses substantial evidenceevidence that is reasonable, credible, and of solid valuesuch that a reasonable trier of fact [citations.] a reviewing court must reverse a conviction where the record provides no discernible support for the verdict even when viewed in the light most favorable to the judgment below. [citation.] nonetheless, it is the jury, not the reviewing court, that must weigh the evidence, resolve conflicting inferences, and determine whether the prosecution established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. [citation.] and if the circumstances view that the circumstances might also reasonably be reconciled with a contrary finding does not warrant reversal of the 6 people v. hubbard (2016) 63 cal.4th 378, 392; see people v. cravens t upon no hypothesis whatever is there sufficient substantial evidence to support [the 2. there was substantial evidence hill had the specific intent to commit aggravated mayhem when he or she unlawfully, under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the physical or psychological well-being of another person, intentionally causes permanent disability or disfigurement of another human being or deprives a human being of a limb, organ, or membe . . .

(see people v. ferrell (1990) 218 cal.app.3d 828, inferred that [the defendant] intended both to kill [the victim], the attack people v. szadziewicz, supra, 161 (people v. quintero, supra, 135 cal.app.4th at p. 1162) because, after his argument with ebony, hill took several steps to set her on fire. he found the rubbing alcohol, obtained a lighter, poured the alcohol on head and upper body, threw a flame at her, and left without pausing to check on the consequences of his actions. and an because ebony suffered burns not only to her face, but also to her upper back, neck, and abdomen, which hill asserts shows the the attack, however, was d 8 though hill also injured other parts of her body. when someone douses another person with flammable liquid, it may be difficult to control precisely and what parts focused enough, even though the alcohol hill threw at ebony also hit other parts of her body. b. hill forfeited his argument the trial court erred in admitting certain details of his prior act of domestic violence, and any error was harmless evidence code section 1109, subdivision (a), provides that, offense involving domestic violence, evidence of the defendants commission of other domestic violence is not made inadmissible by section 1101 if the evidence is not inadmissible pursuant to permits the s other acts of domestic violence for the purpose of showing a propensity to commit such crimes, subject s discretion to exclude the evidence under evidence code section 352.

(see people v. 10 dykes to claimed evidentiary error on the same ground asserted on appeal results in a forfeiture of people v. coffman and marlow (2004) 34 cal.4th 1, 81-82 [failure to object or move to strike testimony forfeits the argument the testimony was inadmissible].) similarly, when the investigator described what hill told him had happened with hassan, the investigator stated hill objection. and when the investigator stated hill had explained he thought hassan would be okay because she was unharmed when he previously hit her, counsel for hill again did not object. in fact, the trial court had ruled before trial that evidence of the pre-2009 incident of domestic violence between hill and hassan -in-chief and would only be admissible in rebuttal if hill contended the attack on ebony was accidental. yet, hill did not object or move to strike the (also brief) mention of the prior incident. hill forfeited these arguments as well. (see people v. alexander (2010) 49 cal.4th 846, 912 [failure to object to the admission of evidence under evid. code,  1101 forfeited the issue on appeal]; people v. bradley (2012) 208 cal.app.4th 64, 89 [same]; people v. crabtree (2009) 169 cal.app.4th 1293, 1314 [defendant forfeited the argument the trial court erred in admitting evidence under evid. code,  moreover, aprior act of domestic violence was harmless. error in admitting s prior acts of domestic violence under [evidence code] section[] 1109 . . . is subject to the standard of prejudice set forth in people v. watson (1956) 46 cal.2d 818 (watsonpeople v. megown (2018) 28 cal.app.5th 157, 167; see people v. ogle (2010) 185 cal.app.4th 1138, 1145.) under 11 watsonit is reasonably probable that a result more favorable to the [defendant] would have been reached in the absence of the error. (megown, at p. 167.) here, even if the investigator had not used the words -2009 incident probability hill would have obtained a more favorable result. undisputed, and overwhelming: he poured rubbing alcohol on his wife and lit her on fire. (see people v. lee (2011) 51 cal.4th 620, 646 [any error people v. curl (2009) 46 cal.4th 339, 362 [any error in admitting statement to establish consciousness of guilt given the s guiltpeople v. ogle, supra, 185 cal.app.4th at p. 1145 [error in admitting uncharged act of domestic violence was harmless [t]he other evidence against appellant was compelling].) and hill does not dispute that most of the testimony about the 2009 incident was admissible. he challenges phrases; their exclusion would not have made any difference. (see people v. penunuri (2018) 5 cal.5th 126, 166 rroneously admitted testimony was harmless beyond people v. brown (2003) 31 cal.4th 518, 548therefore, any error was harmless under watson. 12 c. the trial court did not commit reversible error in failing to instruct on battery and battery with serious bodily injury as lesser included offenses hill contends that, because simple battery and battery with serious bodily injury are lesser included offenses of torture and aggravated mayhem, the trial court had a sua sponte duty to instruct the jury on those crimes. simple battery and battery with serious bodily injury, however, are not lesser included offenses of torture, and battery with serious bodily injury is not a lesser included offense of aggravated mayhem. and although simple battery is a lesser included offense of aggravated mayhem, 1. applicable law battery is the willful and unlawful use of force or violence on the person of another. ( 242.) battery with serious bodily injury is battery condition, including, but not limited to, the following: loss of consciousness; concussion; bone fracture; protracted loss or impairment of function of any bodily member or organ; a wound ( 243, subd. (f)(4).) on a lesser but not the lesser (people v. licas (2007) 41 cal.4th 362, 366 (licas); see people v. cole (2004) 33 a greater offense if either the statutory elements of the greater offense, or the facts actually alleged in the accusatory pleading, include all the elements of the lesser offense, such that the 13 (licas, at p. 366; see people v. hicks (2017) 4 cal.5th 203, 208-the greater offense, or if it arises out of the same criminal course of conduct as the greater offense, but it has one or more elements that are not elements of the greater offense as alleged, then it is a hicks, at p. 209; see people v. hall defendant has no right to instructions on lesser related review to the failure by the trial court to instruct on an assertedly lesser included offlicas, at p. 366; see people v. souza (2012) 54 cal.4th 90, 113.) 2. simple battery and battery with serious bodily injury are not lesser included offenses of torture section 206 defines torture as intending to cause cruel or extreme pain and suffering for the purpose of revenge, extortion, persuasion, or for any sadistic purpose, inflict[ing] great bodily ( 12022.7, subd. (f).) hill concedes battery and battery with serious bodily injury are not lesser included offenses of torture under the elements test. and rightfully so: while battery offenses require a direct or indirect touching, a defendant can commit torture deprivation, such as withholding food and water, causing people v. lewis (2004) 120 cal.app.4th 882, 887.) hill does not argue battery and battery with serious bodily injury are lesser included offenses of torture under the accusatory pleadings test. and with good reason: the pleading here 14 precisely tracked the statutory language and did not include any language describing simple battery or battery with serious bodily injury. (see people v. robinson (2016) 63 cal.4th 200, 207 [where he accusatory pleading incorporates the statutory definition of the charged offense without referring to the particular facts, a reviewing court must rely on the statutory elements to determine if there is a ]; people v. munoz (2019) 31 cal.app.5th 143, 156 [same].) the people alleged in the information: los angeles, the crime of torture, in violation of penal code section 206, a felony, was committed by derrick dwayne hill, who did unlawfully and with the intent to cause cruel and extreme pain and suffering for the purpose of revenge, extortion, persuasion and for a sadistic purpose, inflict great bodily injury, as defined in penal code section 12022.7, upon is language is nearly identical to the statutory language and does not refer to any particular facts that hill unlawfully used force against ebony, as required for a battery. hill battery with serious bodily injury are lesser included offenses under the include consideration of evidence at the preliminary hearing. in people v. ortega (2015) 240 cal.app.4th 956 (ortega), which hill urges us to follow, the court preliminary hearing must be considered in applying the accusatory pleading test when the specific conduct supporting a holding order establishes that the charged offense necessarily id. at p. 967.) s decision in ortega, however, is incos decision in people v. 15 montoya (2004) 33 cal.4th 1031 (montoya), which requires courts only whether a charged offense includes a lesser included offense under the accusatory pleading test. (id. at p. 1036.) indeed, the supreme court in montoya disapproved people v. rush (1993) 16 cal.app.4th 20, which considered evidence at the preliminary hearing in applying the accusatory pleading test. (montoya, at p. 1036, fn. 4; see people v. rush, at p. 27.) significantly, the court of appeal in ortega did not discuss or distinguish montoya. courts since montoya have continued to apply the rule excluding evidence at the preliminary hearing in applying the accusatory pleading test and have declined to follow ortega. (see, e.g., people v. alvarez (2019) 32 cal.app.5th 781, 787-790; people v. munoz, supra, 31 cal.app.5th at pp. 157-158; people v. macias (2018) 26 cal.app.5th 957, 963-965.) as the court in munoz the supreme court has indicated repeatedly . . . that when applying the accusatory pleading test to determine whether one offense is necessarily included in another, courts do not look to evidence beyond the actual pleading and its allegations (munoz, at p. 156; see people v. smith (2013) 57 cal.4th 232, 244 people v. chaney (2005) 131 cal.app.4th 253, 257 entitled to instruction on a lesser uncharged offensewe consider only the plead].) s decision in montoya and join the growing list of post-montoya cases that have refused to apply the expanded accusatory pleading test. therefore, the trial court did not have a sua sponte duty to instruct on simple battery and battery with serious bodily injury as lesser included offenses of torture. 16 3. battery with serious bodily injury is not a lesser included offense of aggravated mayhem maliciously deprives a human being of a member of his body, or disables, disfigures, or renders it useless, or cuts or disables the tongue, or puts out an eye, or slits the nose, ear, or lip, is guilty of although great bodily injury is an element of mayhem (people v. brown (2001) 91 cal.app.4th 256, 272; people v. hill (1994) 23 cal.app.4th 1566, 1575; people v. keenan (1991) 227 cal.app.3d 26, 36, fn. 7; people v. pitts (1990) 223 cal.app.3d 1547, 1559), serious bodily injury is not. (people v. santana (2013) 56 cal.4th 999, 1007; people v. turner (2019) ___ cal.app.5th ___, ___ [2019 wl 3296951, at p. 4].) and although courts have described the terms serious bodily injury and great bodily injury as equivalent in certain contexts, [citation.] this distinction may make a difference when evaluating jury instructions that provide different definitions for the two terms.(santana, at pp. 1008-1009; see people v. poisson (2016) 246 cal.app.4th 121, 125 [citing santana and rejecting the proposition that the terms great bodily injury and serious bodily people v. johnson in section 243, s used in section 12022.7, outside the context of jury instructions].) therefore, for purposes of whether the court has a sua sponte duty to instruct on a lesser included offense, battery with serious bodily injury is not a lesser included offense of simple mayhem. nor is it a lesser included offense of aggravated mayhem. the only differences between simple mayhem and aggravated 17 (people v. park (2003) 112 cal.app.4th 61, 64; see people v. assad (2010) 189 cal.app.4th 187, 195.) aggravated mayhem does not require an injury greater than the injury required for simple mayhem. (see people v. newby (2008) 167 cal.app.4th 1341, that, in addition to the specific intent required for aggravated mayhem, the disfiguring injury must also be more permanent than the thus, battery with serious bodily injury is not a lesser included offense of aggravated mayhem, and the trial court did not have a sua sponte duty to instruct on battery with serious bodily injury. 4. simple battery is a lesser included offense of aggravated mayhem, but any error in failing to instruct on simple battery was harmless hill argues that simple battery is a lesser included offense of aggravated mayhem and that substantial evidence supported a simple battery instruction. the people do not dispute simple battery is a lesser included offense of aggravated mayhem under the elements test. the statutory elements of aggravated mayhem include the elements of battery, such that a defendant cannot commit aggravated mayhem without also committing a battery. (see licas, supra, 41 cal.4th at p. 366.) any error in the trial instruct on simple battery, however, was harmless. to justify a lesser included offense instruction, the evidence supporting the instruction must be substantialthat is, it must be evidence from which a jury composed of reasonable persons could conclude that the facts underlying the particular people v. enraca (2012) 53 cal.4th 735, 759.) any 18 evi but rather by evidence from which a jury cpeople v. avila (2009) 46 cal.4th 680, 705.) instructions on all lesser necessarily included offenses supported [citation.] sponte to instruct, or to instruct fully, on all lesser included offenses and theories thereof which are supported by the evidence must be reviewed for prejudice exclusively under watson . . . . (people v. beltran (2013) 56 cal.4th 935, 955; see people v. hicks, supra, 4 cal.5th at p. 215 failure to instruct on necessarily included offenses is reviewed for prejudice under the watson standard.people v. rogers (2006) 39 cal.4th 826, 867-868 struct on a lesser included offense generally is subject to harmless error review under the standard of people v. watson watson, a defendant must show it is reasonably probable a more (beltran, at p. 955; accord, people v. thomas (2012) 53 cal.4th 771, 814; see people v. prince (2007) 40 cal.4th 1179, 1267 l is required only if it is reasonably probable the jury would have returned a different verdict absent the error or errors thus, even if substantial evidence supported an instruction on a lesser included offense, the relative weight of the evidence may compel the conclusion there is no reasonable probability the failure to instruct affected the result. (beltran, at p. 956; people v. breverman (1998) 19 cal.4th 142, 177-178; see people v. banks (2014) 59 cal.4th 1113, 1161 [evidence sufficient to warrant an instruction on a lesser included offense does not necessarily amount to evidence sufficient to create a reasonable 19 probability of a different outcome had the instruction been ], disapproved on another ground in people v. scott (2015) 61 cal.4th 363, 391, fn. 3.) here, to convict hill of simple battery but not aggravated mayhem, the jury would have to find that hill willfully and unlawfully used force or violence against ebony, but not circumstances manifesting extreme indifferencephysical or psychological well-beingpermanent disability or disfigurementof a limb, organ, or member of . . . ( 205, 242.) there is no reasonable probability of that. hill poured alcohol on ebony and set her on fire, leaving her with second degree burns. hill did not merely use force or violence, he attacked with flammable liquid and fire with the intent to permanently disfigure. no reasonable jury could have found hill was guilty of battery and not aggravated mayhem. therefore, any error in failing to instruct on simple battery was harmless. disposition the judgment is affirmed. segal, j. we concur: perluss, p. j. stone, j. judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
