(cal. const., art. i,  17; people v. regalado (apr. 14, 2015, b255074) [nonpub. opn.].) we remanded the matter to the trial court for resentencing. (people v. regalado, supra, b255074, at p. 2.) on august 19, 2015, the trial court resentenced appellant to 39 years to life on count 3; a concurrent term of 39 years to life on count 2; and 25 years to life on count 9, for a total of 64 years to life. appellant was awarded presentence custody and conduct credits of 1,663 days. appellant appeals, again arguing that his sentence amounts to cruel and unusual punishment. procedural background at the resentencing hearing, the prosecutor recommended a sentence of 50 years to life, while defense counsel asked the trial court to revisit the romero2 motion and impose four to 24 years to life. the trial court noted that this court, in remanding the case, did not suggest that the trial court erred in denying the romero motion and so would not reevaluate with re-sentencing to something that is not the legal equivalent of life without the possibility of 1 all further statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise indicated. 2 people v. superior court (romero) (1996) 13 cal.4th 497 (romero). 3 eligible to earn 20 percent off of his credit in terms of the good time/work time that he will receive as a third case where [appellant] repeatedly victimized this victim in very serious ways. and it continued as he awaited trial with him attempting to dissuade her not only directing her not to come to court, but doing it in tagalog so that it could evade the listeners on the phone. i see a very sophisticated pattern in how he carried this out. and given his criminal history, none of my original feelings or findings or discretion on this case has r of i believe that i am going to have to rework the sentencing sthe functional equivalent of life without the pos with that in mind, the trial court resentenced3 appellant as follows: as to count 3 ( 245, subd.

(in re cervera (2001) 24 cal.4th 1073, 1080.) yet the trial court imposed a sentence under the erroneous belief that appellant was eligible for 20 percent conduct credits for its indeterminate life sentence.4 it follows that the trial court did not understand its discretion and we must reverse the matter and remand the case for resentencing.5 (people v. bruce g. (2002) 97 cal.app.4th 1233, 12471248.) moreover, pursuant to code of civil procedure section 170.1, subdivision (c),6 on our own motion and in the interest of justice, we direct that further proceedings be heard by a judge other than the one whose sentencing orders have been reviewed by this appellate court. 4 the parties dispute whether appellant is entitled to receive any good time/work time credits. that issue may be presented to the trial court at resentencing. 5 be directed to resentence him to a term of no more than 10 years in prison. 6 code of civil procedurof a party or on its own motion an appellate court shall consider whether in the interests of justice it should direct that further proceedings be heard before a trial judge other than the judge 5 disposition the judgment is reversed and the matter is remanded for resentencing. on remand, the case shall be assigned to a different judge. not to be published in the official reports. _____________________________, j. ashmann-gerst we concur: ______________________________, p. j. boren ______________________________, j. hoffstadt
