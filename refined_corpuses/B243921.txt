(1979) 25 cal.3d 436 requesting that this court conduct an independent review of the record to reversal or modification of the judgment. on march 22, 2013, we gave notice to defendant that his counsel had failed to find any arguable issues and that defendant had 30 days within which to submit by brief or letter any grounds of appeal, contentions, or arguments he wished this court to consider. we granted defendant an extension of time through and including may 11, 2013, within which to file his brief. defendant filed a found to be in violation of his probation by a different trial judge than the trial judge who originally placed him on probation, and because he did not receive a timely preliminary hearing in a prior dismissed case, his constitutional and statutory rights were violated. we have reviewed the record and affirm the judgment. background on may 26, 2009, defendant plead no contest to two counts of battery by a prisoner on a non-confined person in violation of section 4501.5. the trial court sentenced defendant to state prison for a term of 4 years, execution of the sentence was suspended, and defendant was placed on formal probation for a period of three years. defendant was ordered to pay certain fines and fees, including the cost of his probation services. dant failed to appear at a hearing pursuant to the 1 all statutory citations are to the penal code unless otherwise noted. 3 submitted a report stating that defendant violated the terms of his probation by failing to report to probation as directed and to make certain required payments. on september 28,

after a violation of probation hearing, the trial courta different trial judge than the trial judge who originally placed defendant on probation on may 26, 2009found that defendant violated the terms of his probation. the trial court ordered that the sentence previously imposed and suspended on may 26, prison for a term of four years, and awarded defendant 73 days of custody credit consisting of 37 days of actual custody credit and 36 days of conduct credit. on september 10, 2012, defendant filed a notice of appeal of the august 24, 2012, judgment. discussion a. violation of probation 4 originally placed him on probation instead of the trial judge who, on august 24, 2012, found defendant to be in violation of his probation and ordered that his original may 26, 2009, sentence be placed in full force and effect. we disagree. court to dismiss the action is not appropriate because defendant filed an appeal, not a petition for writ of mandate. moreover, defendant does not establish that he is entitled to are going to be on probation to me since i am responsible for this and can monitor you . . . probation, defendant argues that he relied on that statement when he pleaded no contest on may 26, 2009 to two counts for violation of section 4501.5. in people v. arbuckle (1978) 22 cal.3d 749 (arbucklegeneral principle . . . whenever a judge accepts a plea bargain and retains sentencing discretion under the agreement, an implied term of the bargain is that sentence will be imposed by that judge. because of the range of dispositions available to a sentencing judge, the propensity in sentencing demonstrated by a particular judge is an inherently id. at pp. 756-757.) the court in arbuckle his plea bargain, the sentence imposed by another judge cannot be alid. at p. 757.) after the trial court ruled on august 24, 2012, that defendant had violated the terms of his probation, defendant objected on the ground that his rights under arbuckle, supra, 22 cal.3d 749, had not been waived. arbuckle, however, is inapplicable. the trial on defendant, and then suspended that sentence and placed defendant on formal probation for a period of three years. arbuckle does not require that the trial judge who accepts the plea bargain and imposes sentence must also preside over any subsequent probation revocation hearing. 5 moreover, even if arbuckle, supra, 22 cal.3d 749 were applicable, defendant waived or forfeited any such right under that case because he did not timely object at the when it occurs in the trial court ordinarily waives the objection on appeal. (jensen v. bmw of north america, inc(padilla v. greater el monte community hospital (2005) 129 cal.app.4th 667, 670.) the failure to object when faced with a different sentencing judge constitutes a waiver of the right trecord demonstrate[s] the arbuckle rights . . . people v. rosaia (1984) 157 cal.app.3d 832, 840, overruled on other grounds as stated in people v. horn (1989) 213 cal.app.3d 701, 708.) defendant failed to object on the ground that his rights under arbuckle, supra, 22 cal.3d 749 would be violated before the trial court ruled on august 24, 2012, but he objected after the trial court ruled. defendant, therefore, knew of his arbuckle rights but nonetheless waived or forfeited those rights by failing to timely object. in addition, even if arbuckle, supra, 22 cal.3d 749 were applicable and defendant n implied term of a plea bargain that the judge who accepts the plea will impose the sentence; rather, the record must affirmatively demonstrate some basis upon which a defendant may reasonably expect that the judge who accepts the plea will retain sentencing discretion. people v. horn, supra, 213 cal.app.3d at pp. 707-708.) we defendant on probation would sentence defendant if he violated probation is probation, it does not reasonably mean that this would occur for a period extending to when defendant completed his probation requirements, or that she would preside over any subsequent probation revocation hearing. furthermore, the lack of a timely objection at the august 24, 2012, hearing suggests that defendant did not enter his may 26, 2009, 6 plea in reliance on or with the understanding that the judge accepting his plea would also preside over any subsequent probation revocation hearing. (people v. horn, supra, 213 cal.app.3d at p. 709.) b. prior case defendant contends that because he was not provided with a timely preliminary hearing in one of his prior casescase number ma 036195his constitutional rights of due process, of equal protection, and to a speedy trial were violated. defendant, however, appealed his august 24, 2012, judgmentin case number ma 043795finding him in violation of his probation. he did not appeal any judgment or appealable order regarding case number ma 036195. case number ma 036195 was dismissed in january 2007. c. review in addition brief, we have made an independent examination of the entire record to determine if there are any other arguable issues on appeal. based on that review, we have determined that there are people v. wende, supra, 25 cal.3d 436. 7 disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. mosk, j. we concur: armstrong, acting p. j. kriegler, j.
