(people v. villa (2009) 45 cal.4th 1063, 10681069; people v. kim (2009) 45 cal.4th 1078, 1108.) escobedo appears to argue in his habeas petition that he was deported in 2001 (two years before his 2003 conviction) as a result of his state conviction or convictions, and therefore his service at lompoc of his federal sentence for illegal reentry is constructive custody by the state. criminal convictioneven those that can later form the basis of a new criminal convictiondo people v. villa, supra, 45 cal.4th at 4 p. 1070.) deportation proceedings are a collateral consequence of a state conviction, and subsequent detention by federal immigration authorities pending deportation does not constitute constructive custody by california. (id. at p. 1072.) imprisonment in 2014 following a conviction for illegal reentry is a further step removed from his state convictions in 1994, 2000, and 2003. his deportation was a collateral consequence that formed the basis of a new criminal conviction, and his federal imprisonment is not constructive custody. the trial court did not err in denying habeas petition and did not abuse its discretion in denying his motion for reconsideration. writ of coram nobis. (people v. kim, supra, 45 cal.4th at p. 1095.) a constitutional coram nobisibid.) further, a petitioner for the writ must show due diligence, and the burden falls on escobedo to explain and justify delay in filing the petition, as well as to allege with specificity the time and circumstance under which the facts were discovered. (id. at pp. 10961097, 10981099.) escobedo did not address why he filed his petition in 2014, almost 11 years after his latest conviction and more than 20 years after his earliest conviction. finally, the trial court stated that his claims had been raised and rejected in , denied before he filed his petition for the writ of coram nobis, rextraordinary relief from a final judgment is not entitled to bring his legal claims to court seriatim. . . . [citations.] as with petitions for writs of habeas corpus, one seeking relief via coram nobis may not attack a final judgment in piecemeal fashion, in proceedings id. at p. 1101.) the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the petition. penal code section 1203.4 relief is not available to a defendant who has pleaded guilty to felony charges and served prison terms, as escobedo did in each case. (people v. borja (1980) 110 cal.app.3d 378, 380.) 5 a motion to seal and expunge records under penal code section 851.8 is available only to a person who has been arrested and no accusatory pleading is filed. (pen. code,  851.8, subd. (a).) escobedo was charged and convicted in each case. we have examined the entire record and are satisfied that escobedofully complied with his responsibilities and that no arguable issues exist.
