(pen. code,  1170.18.)1 we affirm because appellant has not met his burden of showing that he is eligible for resentencing under the voter initiative. factual and procedural summary the preliminary hearing record establishes that, in november 2012, appellant went into a long beach bmw dealership, pretending to pick up a motorcycle for a friend. he handed the manager a key for a bmw f800 motorcycle. attached to the key was vehicle stock tag, . . . identifying the year, make, been missing from the dealership for some time. unbeknownst to appellant, the motorcycle already had been sold. the manager grew suspicious, invited appellant to sit down at the desk, and asked him the name of the person for whom he was picking up the motorcycle. appellant gave a name, but became increasingly nervous. eventually, he grabbed a key for a demonstration motorcycle from the desk and left. the key was recovered after he was apprehended. appellant was charged with felony second degree commercial burglary. ( 459.) two prior convictions were alleged under section 667.5, subdivision (b), one of which qualified as a prior strike conviction under the three strikes law. ( 667, subds. (b)-(i); 1170.12, subds. (a)-(d).) based on a negotiated settlement, appellant pled no contest to the second degree commercial burglary charge, the prior strike was stricken, and the court imposed a three-year prison term. in 2015, appellant filed a form petition for resentencing under proposition 47, on which he checked a box, stating that the amount in question was not more than $950. the court summarily denied the petition because the amount exceeded $950. appellant filed a timely notice of appeal and a request for a certificate of probable cause, in which 1 statutory references are to the penal code. 3 discussion a person is guilty of burglary if he or she enters any building (or other listed structure) with the intent to commit larceny or any felony. ( 459; people v. davis (1998) 18 cal.4th 712, 715.) burglary of an uninhabited building is of the second degree and a felony-misdemeanor (wobbler). ( 460, 461.) proposition 47 added new section 459.5 defining the cwhich reduces some second degree burglaries to misdemeanors. it provides, in relevant part: shoplifting is defined as entering a commercial establishment with intent to commit larceny while that establishment is open during regular business hours, where the value of the property that is taken or intended to be taken does not exceed nine hundred fifty dollars ($950). any other entry into a commercial establishment with intent to commit larceny is burglary. shoplifting shall be punished as a misdemeanor . . . [] (b) any act of shoplifting as defined in subdivision (a) shall be charged as shoplifting. no person who is charged with shoplifting may also be charged with burglary or theft of the same (see people v. contreras (2015) 237 cal.app.4th 868, 890891.) proposition 47 also added section 1170.18, which allows persons previously convicted of felonies that would be misdemeanors under the voter initiative to petition for resentencing. (people v. sherow (2015) 239 cal.app.4th 875, 878879 (sherow ).) into the dealership to commit theft by trick cannot be construed free access to goods offered for sale,and appellant did not have free access to the demonstrator motorcycle, which presumably was not for sale. we do not agree. the same principles that govern statutory construction. [citation.](people v. rizo (2000) 22 cal.4th 681, 685.) we give words their ordinary meanings unless special definitions are provided. (people v. love (2008) 166 cal.app.4th 1292, 1297.) we construe the language in the context of the overall statutory scheme. (rizo, at p. 685.) section 459.5, subdivision (a) defines entering a commercial establishment with intent to commit larceny while that establishment is open during regular business hours.4 definition requires free access to merchandise for sale. broad interpretation since section 490a provides that [w]herever any law or statute of this state refers to or mentions larceny, embezzlement, or stealing, said law or statute shall . . . (see also people v. sanders (1998) 67 cal.app.4th 1403, 1416 larceny, larceny by trick, obtaining money by false pretenses, embezzlement, and related theft offensesconsolidated in  484 heft the voters are presumed to have been aware of existing law. (see john l. v. superior court (2004) 33 cal.4th 158, 171.)2 both parties concommercial burglary with facts that may support a separate unchanged crime of larceny. burglary requires a felonious intent at the time of entry, but not the completion of the intended felony. (people v. allen (1999) 21 cal.4th 846, 863as a practical matter, if the defendant commits, or gives some indication of intending to commit, theft or a felony in a building shortly after entering it, no great inferential leap is necessary to conclude that the intent to commit the supporting offense existed at the time of entry.(people v. kwok (1998) 63 cal.app.4th 1236, 1246.) here, immediately upon entry, appellant attempted to obtain possession of a bmw f800 motorcycle, by presenting the key to the vehicle and claiming that he needed to pick up the motorcycle for a friend. from these facts, it may be inferred that he entered the dealership with the intent to commit a crime of deception, most probably theft, or larceny, by trick. (see people v. traster (2003) 111 cal.app.4th 1377, 1387 [in larceny by trick, only possession of property is acquired, whereas obtaining property by false pretenses requires fraudulent acquisition of both possession and ownership].) empted larceny by trick was unsuccessful, or factually impossible because the bmw f800 motorcycle had been sold, is irrelevant. factual 2 the issue of whether the definition of shoplifting in section 459.5 requires an intent to commit larceny or theft of any kind is currently pending before the california supreme court. (see people v. gonzales (2015) 242 cal.app.4th 35, review granted feb. 17, 2016, s231171.) 5 impossibility, or the defense of mistake of fact, negates criminal intent only when he defendant holds a mistaken belief in a fact or set of circumstances which, if existent or ts otherwise criminal conduct lawful. (see people v. lawson (2013) 215 cal.app.4th 108, 111.) nothing in the record in this case suggests that defendant had a mistaken belief in his right to possess the bmw f800 motorcycle. nor is his subsequent theft of the key to a demonstration motorcycle relevant to the intent with which he entered the dealership. appellant contends the record of conviction shows the amount at issue is less than $950. a number of courts have concluded that a defendant bears the initial burden of showing eligibility for resentencing under proposition 47, including the value of the property at issue. (see people v. perkins (2016) 244 cal.app.4th 129, 136137; people v. rivas-colon (2015) 241 cal.app.4th 444, 449450; sherow, supra, 239 cal.app.4th at pp. 878880.) that is because existence or nonexistence of which is essential to the claim for relief or defense he is id. at p. 879; see evid.code,  500.) the court in sherow suggested that a proper petition could certainly contain at least [the defendant testimony about the nature of the items taken. if he made the initial showing the court can take such action as appropriate to grant the petition or permit further factual determination. (people v. bradford (2014) 227 cal.app.4th 1322, 1341.)sherow, supra, 239 cal.app.4th at p. 880.) that does not mean that a defendant can meet his or her initial burden by checking off a box on the petition regarding the value of the property at issue, especially where, as here, the defendant either is mistaken about, or misrepresents, the property whose value is at issue. e are not required to presume that his conviction was for the least punishable offense. his reliance on people v. guerrero (1988) 44 cal.3d 343 is misplaced because the issue in that case was whether a prior conviction could be used for enhancement purposes. (id. at p. 354.) in that situation, the prosecution has the burden of proof. (see people v. towers (2007) 150 cal.app.4th asonable doubt that 6 in contrast, here, appellant is seeking more favorable treatment, which is why he has the burden of showing eligibility. if the record of conviction is silent as to the amount at issue, appellant fails to show eligibility for resentencing. appellant acknowledges that the record of conviction includes the transcript of the or while the manager did not testify to the precise value of the bmw f800 motorcycle, he did say that the key appellant presented at the dealership had it is reasonable to infer that appellant entered the dealership with the intent to obtain a new bmw motorcycle by trick, and that the value of a new brand-name motorcycle in 2012 exceeded $950. (see people v. zamudio (2008) 43 cal.4th 327, 357358 [circumstantial evidence and reasonable inferences may be substantial evidence supporting conviction]; see also people v. giordano (2007) 42 cal.4th 644, 666 [trial court order presumed correct on appeal; [a]ll intendments and presumptions are indulged to support it on matters as to which the record is silent, and erro].) we find no error. disposition the order is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports epstein, p. j. we concur: manella, j. collins, j.
