(a)(1) [count 8]). he also admitted one personal weapon use allegation and three principal armed allegations. ( 12022.53, subd. (b), 12022, subd. (a)(1).) pursuant to the plea agreement, he received a 19-year sentence.2 according to both the reporters transcript and the abstract of judgment, the terms were to run consecutively, but according to the minute order, the terms were to run concurrently. in 2013, defendant moved to amend the abstract of judgment to conform to the minute order, which stated that the terms were to run concurrently. after reviewing the oral and written transcripts for the 2003 sentencing hearing, the trial court denied the motion, stating in its november 2013 order: pursuant to the plea and sentencing transcript, the terms were to run consecutively. . . . [] the clerks minutes were subsequently corrected nunc pro tunc to correct the concurrent entry. 1 all further statutory references are to the penal code. 2 on count 12 (robbery), defendant received a five-year base term for the robbery conviction and a 10-year term for the weapon enhancement, for a total of 15 years. on count 1 (robbery), defendant received a one-year term for the robbery conviction (one-third the middle term of three years) plus a four-month term for the weapon enhancement, for a total of one year and four months. defendant received the identical sentence on count 5 (robbery). on count 8 (assault with a deadly weapon), defendant received a one-year term for the assault conviction (one-third the middle term of three years) plus a four-month term for the weapon enhancement, for a total of one year and four months. 3 defendant appealed from the november 2013 order and we appointed counsel to represent him in the appeal. after reviewing the record, counsel filed an opening brief that requested our independent review of the record pursuant to people v. wende (1979) 25 cal.3d 436, 441. we directed counsel to send the record and a copy of the opening brief to defendant, and we notified defendant that he had 30 days within which to submit any contentions or issues that he wished us to consider. we received no response from him. we note that the appeal is necessarily limited to noncertificate issues, namely the denial of the postjudgment motion to correct the abstract of judgment. (see  1237.5; people v. johnson (2009) 47 cal.4th 668, 677-678 [no certificate of probable cause is required where the defendant is challenging errors that occurred after his plea was entered as to the penalty to be imposed].) according to the november 2013 order, the discrepancy between the oral pronouncement of sentence (which stated that the terms are to run consecutively) and the clerks minutes (which stated that the terms are to run concurrently) has been corrected. because the clerks minutes now state that the terms are to run consecutively, the written record conforms with the courts oral pronouncement that the terms are to run consecutively. (people v. jones (2012) 54 cal.4th 1, 89 [where there is a conflict between the oral and written pronouncement of sentence, the oral pronouncement of sentence shall control].) because the discrepancy was corrected, the motion to amend the abstract of judgment was properly denied. having examined the relevant portion of the record, we are satisfied that defendants attorneys have fully complied with their responsibilities and that no arguable appellate issue exists.
