(see, e.g., people v. johnson (2016) 1 cal.app.5th 953, 969-970; people v. perkins (2016) 244 cal.app.4th 129, 136-137 (perkins); people v. rivas-colon (2015) 241 cal.app.4th 444, 449-450; people v. sherow (2015) 239 cal.app.4th 875, 879-880; see also couzens and bigelow, proposition 47may 2016) p. 42.) we agree with the rationale of these authorities. upon which to determine his eligibility for relief under section 1170.18, exce according to a march 17, 2005 minute order, monetary restitution was ordered as part of the plea agreement. pursuant to a stipulation of the parties, 12 of the victims received monetary compensation, with the smallest amount specified as $1,215. the minute order further noted that the agreed-upon restitution was the reasonable inference is that the items taken from the other victims were recovered, and monetary compensation was thus not warranted. it does not, as defendant argues, demonstrate that the value of the items stolen from the 5 other victims necessarily was less than $950. the petition was properly denied. defendant moved this court to take judicial notice of his probation report and a two-page document from the trial court e to defendant demonstrating that the probation report was before the trial court. defendant has not established that the report was before event, nothing in the documents presented for judicial notice contains any additional relevant evidence, and the request is denied. defendant also requested leave to augment the record with cand november 13, 2015 hearings on his petition. we granted s request. the corrected transcripts clarify that defendant was not present, nor represented by counsel, at either hearing. the august 21 hearing was merely a continuance to petition was denied at the november 13 hearing. the fact defendant was not present or represented by improper. like the defendant in perkins, defendant failed to present a petition that demonstrated his eligibility for resentencing. a case for eligibility, stating and in some cases showing the offense of conviction has been reclassified as a misdemeanor and, where the offense of conviction is a theft crime reclassified based on the value of stolen property, showing the value of the property did not exceed $950. [citation.] the defendant must attach 6 information or evidence necessary to enable the court to determine eligibi (perkins, supra, 244 cal.app.4th at pp. 136-137.) normal case the superior court will rule on the basis of the perkins, supra, 244 cal.app.4th at p. 137; see also couzens and bigelow, proposition 472016) p. 38 moreover, there is no right to appointed counsel at the eligibility phase of review. (couzens and bigelow, p. 73 defendant is entitled to counsel for the initial preparation of the defendant failed to meet his burden of proof and the trial court was well within its authority to summarily deny his petition for failing to make a prima facie showing he was entitled to relief. disposition the , denying esentencing pursuant to penal code section 1170.18 is affirmed. grimes, j. we concur: rubin, acting p. j. flier, j.
