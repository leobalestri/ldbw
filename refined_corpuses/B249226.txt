(a)), making a criminal threat ( 422, subd. (a)), and assault with a firearm ( 245, subd. (a)(2)). the information specially alleged that ortiz had used a handgun to commit the offenses ( 12022.5, subd. (a)) and had suffered one prior serious or violent felony conviction within the meaning of section 667, subdivision (a)(1), and the three strikes law ( 667, subds. (b)-(i), 1170.12). 1 undesignated statutory references are to the penal code. 2 pinto gave conflicting accounts of the altercation in her police interview, in her preliminary hearing testimony, and in her trial testimony. 3 a jury convicted ortiz of willfully inflicting corporal injury on a former cohabitant and of simple assault as a lesser included offense of assault with a firearm, and acquitted him of making a criminal threat. the jury found not true the firearm-use allegation. in a bifurcated proceeding, the trial court found true the prior conviction allegations. prior to sentencing, counsel for ortiz moved pursuant to romero to dismiss ortizs prior strike conviction in 1996 for willfully inflicting corporal injury on a cohabitant (not pinto) and causing great bodily injury ( 273.5, 12022.7). counsel for ortiz argued that the 1996 strike conviction was remote, ortizs only convictions in the ensuing 16 years were for misdemeanor offenses, and pintos injuries were minor. the prosecutor argued in response that ortiz was on misdemeanor probation at the time of the current offense and that his criminal record reflected a history of violence, particularly against women. the probation officers report, which the trial court read and considered, stated that ortiz was 35 years old at the time of the current offense. his criminal activities began in 1993 with a juvenile adjudication for receiving stolen property. as an adult, apart from his 1996 strike conviction, ortiz was convicted of the following misdemeanor offenses: vandalism in 1996, driving on a suspended license in 2000, making a criminal threat in 2001, possession of a controlled substance in 2007, giving false identification to a police officer and driving without a valid license in 2005 and in 2006, driving on a suspended license in 2008, disturbing the peace in 2008, driving under the influence in 2011, and domestic violence involving pinto in 2011. ortiz also had a number of probation violations and was a documented gang member. in denying the romero motion, the trial court considered counsel for ortizs arguments in the context of ortizs entire criminal history. the court observed that, although the 1996 strike conviction was relatively remote, ortiz had engaged in a pattern of criminal conduct since 1996, including violent offenses against women, and he had performed poorly on probation. the court then sentenced ortiz to an aggregate state prison term of eight years consisting of the middle term of four years for violating 4 section 273.5, subdivision (a), doubled under the three strikes law. the court stayed a six-month term for simple assault pursuant to section 654. discussion section 1385, subdivision (a), gives the court discretion to dismiss a prior conviction, including a qualifying strike conviction, in furtherance of justice. (people v. superior court (romero), supra, 13 cal.4th at p. 530; see people v. clancey (2013) 56 cal.4th 562, 582 [three strikes law does not restrict the power of a trial court acting on its own motion to dismiss a prior felony conviction allegation in the furtherance of justice]; in re large (2007) 41 cal.4th 538, 543 [trial courts in cases charged under the three strikes law may, in the exercise of their sound discretion, dismiss prior felony conviction allegations in furtherance of justice under section 1385, subdivision (a)].) [t]he sentence that is actually imposed under the three strikes law is frequently dependent upon the trial courts exercise of discretion in determining whether, in furtherance of justice, to strike any of the serious or violent prior convictions that have been charged by the prosecutor and, if so, how many prior convictions to strike. (in re coley (2012) 55 cal.4th 524, 559-560.) [w]hen facing a motion to dismiss a strike allegation, the trial court must consider whether, in light of the nature and circumstances of [the defendants] present felonies and prior serious and/or violent felony convictions, and the particulars of [the defendants] background, character, and prospects, the defendant may be deemed outside the schemes spirit, in whole or in part, and hence should be treated as though he had not previously been convicted of one or more serious and/or violent felonies. (people v. vargas (2014) 59 cal.4th 635, 641, quoting people v. williams (1998) 17 cal.4th 148, 161.) [a] trial courts refusal or failure to dismiss or strike a prior conviction allegation under section 1385 is subject to review for abuse of discretion. (people v. carmony (2004) 33 cal.4th 367, 375.) [t]he three strikes law not only establishes a sentencing norm, it carefully circumscribes the trial courts power to depart from this norm and 5 requires the court to explicitly justify its decision to do so. in doing so, the law creates a strong presumption that any sentence that conforms to these sentencing norms is both rational and proper. [citation.] (in re large, supra, 41 cal.4th at pp. 550-551.) [i]t is not enough to show that reasonable people might disagree about whether to strike one or more prior conviction allegations. [citation.](carmony, supra, at p. 378.) [b]ecause the circumstances must be extraordinary . . . by which a career criminal can be deemed to fall outside the spirit of the very scheme within which he squarely falls once he commits a strike as part of a long and continuous criminal record, the continuation of which the law was meant to attack [citation], the circumstances where no reasonable people could disagree that the criminal falls outside the spirit of the three strikes scheme must be even more extraordinary. [citation.] (people v. vargas, supra, 59 cal.4th at p. 641.) ortiz argues that the trial court abused its discretion in denying his romero motion because of the remoteness of the 1996 strike conviction, the nonviolent nature of his misdemeanor criminal history, and the evidence pinto had initiated the physical contact and had suffered only minor injuries in the altercation. the court examined ortizs 1996 strike conviction along with his criminal history and the nature and circumstances of his current offense. the court noted that while ortizs prior strike conviction was relatively remote and that his criminal history consisted of misdemeanor offenses, the record nevertheless established ortiz was a recidivist offender with a history of violence against women, had violated probation, and had poor prospects for the future. under these circumstances, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in dismiss his prior strike conviction, even though the conviction was 16 years old. (see people v. williams, supra, 17 cal.4th at pp. 162-164 [trial court abused its discretion by striking 13-year-old prior strike where there was little or nothing favorable in the , or prospects]; people v. pearson (2008) 165 argument that [prior] convictions are remote in time is without merit where, as here, the defendant has led a continuous life of crimepeople v. strong the overwhelming majority of california appellate 6 courts have reversed the dismissal of, or affirmed the refusal to dismiss, a strike of those defendants with a long and continuous criminal careerpeople v. gaston (1999) 74 cal.app.4th 310, 320 [trial court abused its discretion in striking 17-year-old prior strike unrelenting record of recidivism, even while on parole or probation from previous felony convictionspeople v. barrera (1999) 70 cal.app.4th 541, 554 [trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to strike 14-year-old prior trial court here fully considered background, the nature of his current offense, and the individualized considerations of his long-standing drug addiction and the pattern and nature of his criminal history ortiz also cites an evidentiary ruling during the trial to support his argument that the trial court abused its discretion in denying his romero motion after trial. the trial court ruled that was inadmissible under evidence code sections 352 and 1109, subdivision (a)(1), because the conviction was on appeal ortiz argues that the [evidence code] section 1109 evidence showed it considered the strike to be so remote as ] prison the standards for the admissibility of a prior conviction under evidence code sections 352 and 1109 and for striking a prior strike conviction under romero for purposes of sentencing, however, are markedly different. under evidence code section 352, the court considers whether the probative value of the evidence is substantially outweighed by either an undue consumption or time or a substantial danger of undue prejudice, confusion of the issue, or misleading the jury. under romero the court considers the circumstances of the dthe three strikes law. (people v. vargas, supra, 59 cal.4th at p. 641.) the concerns about consumption of time, undue prejudice, confusing the issues, and misleading the 7 jury, do not arise, or at least do not arise in the same way. moreover, as the people correctly argue, the applicable presumptions are different. under evidence code section 1109, subdivision (e), evide . . . unless the (see people v. johnson domestic violence is presumptively admissible under [evidence code section 1109,] ubdivision (e) establishes a presumption that conduct more than 10 years prior to the current offense is inadmissibleunder romerostrong presumptionsentencing norm,justice not to do so. (in re large, supra, 41 cal.4th at p. 550; see people v. carmony, supra, 33 cal.4th at p. 378.) finally, although ortiz does not raise the issue, we note that he is entitled to an additional 18 days of presentence conduct credit. ortiz was sentenced under the three section 667.5, his presentence custody credits are not limited under section 2933.1. (people v. philpot (2004) 122 cal.app.4th 893, 908; accord, people v. thomas (1999) 21 cal.4th 1122, 1130.) see people v. rajanayagam (2012) 211 cal.app.4th 42, 49, 53 [under section 4019, for crimes . . at the rate of earned under this section, a term of four days will be deemed to have been served for ; accord, people v. garcia (2012) 209 cal.app.4th 530, 540.) ortiz spent 22 days in custody. therefore, ortiz was entitled to 22 days of conduct credit. the trial court gave him only four days. he is entitled to an additional 18 days of conduct credit, for a total of 44 days of presentence custody credit. we modify the judgment accordingly. 8 disposition the judgment is modified to provide 18 days of conduct credit, for a total of 44 days of presentence custody credit. the judgment is affirmed as modified. the trial court is directed to prepare a modified abstract of judgment and forward a copy to the department of corrections and rehabilitation. segal, j.* we concur: perluss, p. j. zelon, j. * judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
