(b)(1)(b) & (c)). appellant pled not guilty to all counts and denied the allegations. on january 23, 2013, the date set for the preliminary hearing, the trial court -plea offer. the court stated that if appellant were willing to say did the crimes, and . . . did it with all the allegathe court would put the matter over to a sentencing hearing, to determine any aggravating or mitigating factors and the particular sentence that would be imposed. the court noted that the people had made an offer of 15 years, four 1 all further statutory citations are to the penal code. 3 months, but that appellant faced a maximum of 23 years, 8 months. the court other factors that are aggravating and that one should very much consider upon accordingly, the court explained that pursuant to its offer, the maximum[] . . . . athere will be no withdrawal of [the] plea[] saying you had no idea what you were getting yoursel[representations as to the actual sentence, other than that it would fall between the minimum and the maximum. and waiving his constitutional rights, appellant pled no contest to all the charges and admitted the gang allegations. defense counsel stipulated to a factual basis for the plea. on march 14, 2013, appellant moved to withdraw his plea because he had case was weak. the motion to withdraw his plea was denied. that afternoon, the trial court held the sentencing hearing. during the hearing, the prosecution requested a 15-year, four month sentence be imposed based on several aggravating factors: (1) the crimes involved a high degree of callousness; (2) the victims were particularly vulnerable; potential sentence included concurrent sentences for which he could have received consecutive sentences; (4) the manner in which the crimes were carried out indicated planning, sophistication, and professionalism; (5) appellant engaged in 4 violent conduct indicating a serious danger history showed escalating seriousness from prior arrests to the current felony charges. the trial court then hea and his younger brother. the mother stated that appellant was not a gang member, and that he received disability benefits, as he suffers from insomnia, obesity, and other medical conditions. the brother stated that appellant was not a gang member, that up and that he would have his family as support to pursue his goals. appellants counsel indicated he wanted to present a rap music video appellant had made to show that the appellant was not a gang member, but merely an aspiring rap artist who used gang iconography for theatrical effect. the court stated, are pressed for time. 30 seconds. the court questioned the relevance of the evidence, as appellant had admitted the gang allegation, but thereafter allowed appellant to play 30 seconds of the video. appellant then made a statement, apologizing for his actions and asking for leniency. defense counsel argued that the court should impose a six-year sentence, as no evidence showed the victims were specifically targeted or that appellant was a gang member. he began arguing that appellant had cooperated with the investigating officers by assisting them in locating some of the stolen items when appellant interrupted, stating subsequently, the court stated that it had heard enough. defense counsel indicated he had additional argument, but the court stated: to cut you off. your client managed to do that for you. 5 the court sentenced appellant to state prison for a total of 12 years, consisting of the low term of two years on all counts, to be served concurrently, and a 10-year gang enhancement on the base count pursuant to section 186.22, subdivision (b)(1)(c). it struck the gang allegations as to the other counts. appellant timely noticed an appeal, but did not seek a certificate of probable cause. discussion appellant seeks a new sentencing hearing. he contends the trial court had promised that it would impose a six-year sentence, unless there were aggravating or mitigating factors that would cause the court to deviate from its initial assessment . appellant further contends the court breached the plea agreement by (1) imposing the 10-year gang enhancement pursuant to section 186.22, subdivision (b)(1)(c) despite the lack of evidence supporting that enhancement, and (2) denying him a full and complete opportunity to present his mitigating evidence and to challenge adverse evidence. we disagree. the court did not breach the plea agreement by imposing the 10-year gang enhancement and sentencing appellant to a total of 12 years in prison. no promise was made that absent aggravating circumstances shown at the sentencing hearing, the default sentence would be six years. rather, the trial court offered appellant a sentence of between six years and 15 years, four months, if he pled to all of the charges and allegations. the court expressly stated that it was making no representation about the final sentence to be imposed. it did not represent that it would strike the 10-be construed to acknowledge n to strike the gang enhancement if it determined that doing so would be in the interests of justice. (see  186.22, additional punishment for the enhancements 6 provided in this section . . . in an unusual case where the interests of justice would best be served, if the court specifies on the record and enters into the minutes the circumstances indicating that the interests of justice would best be served by that the sentence imposed -- 12 years -- was within the range given appellant at the time of his plea and admission. the court neither promised -- nor was obliged -- to strike the gang enhancement, and by imposing the 10-year enhancement, impliedly found the interests of justice would not be served by striking it. sentencing hearing to support the gang enhancement must be rejectedadmission of the gang allegation constituted substantial evidence to support imposition of the 10-cannot challenge the factual basis for the gang enhancement without first obtaining a certificate of probable cause. (people v. zuniga (2014) 225 cal.app.4th 1178, 1187.) this he has not done. we further reject appellantagreement and denied him due process by failing to afford him a full and complete sentencing hearing. a defendant has a right to present mitigating evidence and to respond to adverse sentencing information at the sentencing hearing. (people v. arbuckle (1978) 22 cal.3d 749, 753.) however, a defendant is entitled to relief on due process grounds only if the hearing procedures are fundamentally unfair.(id. at p. 754, italics omitted.) s ability to present a mitigating case to the trier of fact, no due process violation occurspeople v. thornton (2007) 41 cal.4th 391, 452-453.) here, the court heard statements from appellant, his mother and his younger brother. at defense court also viewed a portion of a video, and heard argument 7 from defense counsel. the limitation on further argument did not rise to the level of a due process violation. (see id. at p. 453 [limitation of defense witness that he was not a gang member. while the trial court might have -- but was not required to -- consider this a factor in mitigation, it did not undermine the factual requirement for the imposition of the gang enhancement. (see, e.g., people v. villalobos (2006) 145 cal.app.4th 310, 321-322 [affirming imposition of gang enhancement as to nongang member, as she assisted gang member in committing burglary for benefit of gang].) in short, the court did not breach the plea agreement by refusing to afford appellant a full and complete hearing. accordingly, appellant is not entitled to a new sentencing hearing. disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. manella, j. we concur: willhite, acting p. j. edmon, j.* ________________________________________________________________________ * judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
