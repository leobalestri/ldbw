(people v. totari (2002) 28 cal.4th 876, 879, 887; people v. arriaga (2014) 58 cal.4th 950, 960.) section 1237, subdivision (b) provides that a defendant may here, in his notice of appeal and in his opening brief, guzman represents that he appealed february 2, 2015 order denying his motion to withdraw his plea. however, there is no such order. guzman cites to the february 2, 2015 minute order, but the minute order only documents the trial court ruling sentence reduction motion. the record contains no indication that the trial court ruled on ; in fact, the february 2, 2015 hearing transcript confirms guzmanunsel concurrence with the trial court take off . there is no order on the motion to for this court to review; thus, the required statutory prerequisite for appellate review is absent. we do not have jurisdiction to consider this appeal and must dismiss it. a certificate of probable cause on the question of advisement on immigration consequences pursuant to section 1016.5. but, a certificate of probable cause is not a substitute for a ruling on a motionand therefore is ineffective to confer appellate jurisdiction. (see, e.g., people v. devaughn (1977) 18 cal.3d 889, 896.) guzman has failed to take the necessary procedural steps to perfect an appeal. we must dismiss his appeal. 5 disposition the appeal is dismissed. not to be published. johnson, j. we concur: rothschild, p. j. chaney, j.
