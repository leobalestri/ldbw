(d))1 for damage to the gazebo. at trial the prosecutor emphasized the arson charge related to damage to the 1 statutory references are to this code unless otherwise stated. 3 gazebo and not to damage to the second the jury found nava guilty of the charged offense. at sentencing, bnava had also violated his probation in los angeles superior court case no. ba447788 for aggravated assault and revoked his probation in that case. and other aggravating factors, the court sentenced nava to an aggregate state prison term of four years, the upper term of three years for arson plus a consecutive term of one year (one-third the in case no. ba447788. the court also imposed a $300 restitution fine ( 1202.4), a $30 court facilities assessment (gov. code,  70373) and a $40 court operations assessment ( 1465.8).2 discussion 1. the court had no sua sponte duty to instruct the jury on the lesser included offense of unlawfully causing a fire under section 452 the trial court has a sua sponte duty to instruct a jury on all lesubstantial evidence supports the conclusion that the defendant committed 2 the minute order and abstract of judgment reflect imposition of a $300 restitution fine under section 1202.4, while the 00 restitution fine. conflicts between presumed clerical and generally oral pronouncements unless the record plainly reflects a contrary intent. (people v. smith (1983) 33 cal.3d 596, 599; in re p.a. (2012) 211 cal.app.4th 23, 30, fn. 4.) here, the circumstances in the record suggest, and the people concede, the court intended to impose the minimum restitution fine of $300, as properly reflected in the minute order and abstract of judgment. 4 the lesser included offen (people v. gonzalez (2018) 5 cal.5th 186, 196; accord, people v. shockley (2013) 58 cal.4th party, whether by design or inadvertence, from forcing an all-or-nothing choice between conviction of the stated offense on the one hand, or cogonzalez, at pp. 196-197; accord, people v. smith (2013) 57 cal.4th 232, 239-240.) included offense de novo (see people v. licas (2007) 41 cal.4th 362, 367; people v. manriquez (2005) 37 cal.4th 547, 581), considering the evidence in the light most favorable to the defendant (people v. brothers (2015) 236 cal.app.4th 24, 30; people v. millbrook (2014) 222 cal.app.4th 1122, 1137). or she willfully and maliciously sets fire to or burns or causes to subdivision (dparagraph, arson of property does not include one burning or causing to be burned his or her own personal property unless the setting of the fire must be a deliberate and intentional act, as distinguished from an accidental or unintentional ignition or act in re v.v. (2011) 51 cal.4th 1020, 1029.) arson is a general intent crime. (ibid.; people v. atkins (2001) 25 cal.4th 76, 85.) there is no requirement that a person commit the act with the specific intent to cause damage. rather, it is sufficient if the defendant a general intent to willfully commit the act of setting 5 on fire under such circumstances that the direct, natural, and highly probable consequences would be the burning of the in re v.v., at p. 1029.) causing a fire when he [or she] recklessly sets fire to or burns or causes to be burned, any structure, forest land or property. [] . . . [] (d) unlawfully causing a fire of property is a misdemeanor. for purposes of this paragraph, unlawfully causing a fire of property does not include one burning or causing to be burned his [or her] own personal property unless there is lesser included offense of arson as defined by section 451. (see in re v.v., supra, 51 cal.4th at p. 1025; people v. schwartz (1992) 2 cal.app.4th 1319, 1324 (schwartz).) it applies when the fire was not deliberately set, but was accidental or reckless. (in re v.v., at p. unlawfully causing a fire covers relying on schwartz, supra, 2 cal.app.4th 1322, nava contends the court had a sua sponte duty to instruct the jury on the lesser included offense of unlawfully (that is, recklessly) causing a fire of property under section 452, subdivision (d). in schwartz the defendant had poured gasoline on car frames and parts stored in a garage, lit a piece of paper on fire, and threw it to the ground in the garage. the garage and several cars were damaged from the blaze. the jury convicted the defendant of arson of a structure under section 451, subdivision (c). on appeal the defendant argued the trial court had a sua sponte duty to instruct the jury with the lesser included offense of unlawfully (recklessly) causing a fire to a structure ( 452, subd. (c)), citing 6 evidence, if believed, that would have supported a finding that the defendant intended to set fire to the cars, not the structure. (schwartz, at p. 1325.) the court of appeal agreed, concluding the trial court had erred in failing to instruct the jury sua sponte on the lesser included offense of unlawfully causing a fire to a structure. (ibid.) nava contends he intended to burn his own blanket and perhaps other items belonging to the other man, not the gazebo, and the court erred in failing to instruct the jury sua sponte with unlawfully causing a fire resulting in damage to property, a misdemeanor. ( 452, subd. (d).) his argument fails. even if there were substantial evidence to support a finding nava did not intend to burn city property, the absence of specific intent is immaterial. as the supreme court explained nearly two decades after schwartz was decided, a defendant need only intend to ignite the fire ch circumstances that the direct, natural, and highly probable consequences would be the burning of the a defendant need not intend to damage the property at issue. (in re v.v., supra, 51 cal.4th at p. 1029.) nava identifies no evidence the fire was accidentally or recklessly ignited, which would support a lesser included offense instruction. the court did not err in failing to give one. 2. remand is necessary to permit nava to challenge his ability to pay the imposed fines, fees and assessments nava contends remand is required in accordance with our decision in people v. dueas (2019) 30 cal.app.5th 1157 (dueas) to allow him the opportunity to present evidence as to his inability to pay the fines, fees and assessments imposed at sentencing. in dueas this court provisions of government code section 70373 and penal code 7 section 1465.8, if imposed without a determination that the defendant is able to pay, are . . . fundamentally unfair; imposing these assessments upon indigent defendants without a determination that they have the present ability to pay violates due process under both the united states constitution and the as this court noted, the court assessments, which must be imposed on every criminal conviction, were enacted as part of legislation to raise funds for california courts, not to impose punishment on the defendant. (dueas, at pp. 1164-1165.) in contrast to the assessments, a restitution fine under section recognized as, dueas, supra, 30 cal.app.5th at pp. 1165, 1169.) section 1202.4, subdivision (c), provides the restitution fine; rather, inability to pay may be considered only when increasing the amount of the restitution fine above the minimum required by statute. to avoid the serious constitutional question raised by imposition of the restitution fines on an indigent defendant, we held that, court is required by . . . section 1202.4 to impose a restitution fine, the court must stay the execution of the fine until and unless the people demonstrate that the defendant has the ability dueas, at p. 1172.) otherwise, unpaid restitution fines would later be enforceable as a civil judgment, which could be collected by the state as an offset against any amount a state agency owes a defendant, including tax refunds. (id. at pp. 1169-1170.) further, a defendant granted probation who does not have the ability to pay the restitution fine would be 8 unable to fulfill the conditions of probation, and as a result, his or her own he or she [would be] categorically barred from earning the right to have his or her charges dropped and to relief from the penalties and disabilities of the offense for which he or she has been on probation, no matter how completely he or she complies with every other id. at pp. 1170-1171, citing  1203.4, subd. (a)(1).) the people argue nava, who was sentenced prior to our decision in dueas, has forfeited this issue because he failed to raise it in the trial court. we have rejected the application of forfeiture in these circumstances. (see people v. castellano (2019) 33 cal.app.5th 485, 489 (castellano) court prior to dueas had held it was unconstitutional to impose fines, fees or assessments without a determination of the . . . challenge on direct appeal is based on a newly announced constitutional principle that could not reasonably have been anticipated at the time of trial, reviewing courts have declined to 3 alternatively, relying on decisions by our sister courts of appeal that have disagreed with our substantive analysis in 3 the intermediate appellate courts are currently divided as raise it in the trial court prior to issuance of our decision in dueas. (compare, e.g., castellano, supra, 33 cal.app.5th at pp. 488-489 [issue not forfeited]; people v. johnson (2019) 35 cal.app.5th 134, 138 [same] with people v. frandsen (2019) 33 cal.app.5th 1126, 1153-1155 [forfeited]; people v. bipialaka (2019) 34 cal.app.5th 455, 464 [forfeited].) 9 dueas,4 the people argue the issue of the restitution fine is properly addressed under the excessive fines clause of the eighth amendment to the united states constitution, and neither that constitutional provision nor due process requires remand to permit a defendant to contest his or her ability to pay a restitution fine that is not grossly disproportional to the gravity of the offense.5 in people v. belloso (nov. 26, 2019, b290968) __ cal.app.5th ___ [2019 cal.app. lexis 1181]), we addressed these arguments and reaffirmed our holdings in dueas and castellano. accordingly, as the judgment in case is not yet final, we remand the matter to the trial court so that nava may request a hearing and present evidence demonstrating his inability to pay the fines, fees and assessments imposed by the trial court. 4 several intermediate appellate courts have taken issue with our substantive holding in dueas. (see, e.g., people v. hicks (2019) 40 cal.app.5th 320, 327, review granted nov. 26, 2019, s258946; people v. aviles (2019) 39 cal.app.5th 1055, 1068; people v. caceres (2019) 39 cal.app.5th 917, 926-928.) the supreme court recently granted review of the decision in people v. kopp (2019) 38 cal.app.5th 47, 96-99, review granted november 13, 2019, s257844, to decide the following issues: imposing or executing fines, fees, and assessments? if so, which pay? 5 conceding the court facilities assessment (gov. code,  70373) and court operations assessment (pen. code,  1465.8) are not punishment, the people expressly limit their substantive challenge to the imposition of the restitution fine, stating they do[] not seek to uphold the imposition of these [court] 10 disposition the judgment is affirmed, and the matter remanded to permit nava to request a hearing and present evidence demonstrating his inability to pay the court facilities and court operations assessments and the restitution fine. if nava demonstrates his inability to pay the assessments, the court must strike them. if the trial court determines nava does not have the ability to pay the restitution fine, it must stay execution of that fine. if nava fails to demonstrate his inability to pay these amounts, the fines, fees and assessments imposed may be enforced. perluss, p. j. we concur: zelon, j. segal, j.
