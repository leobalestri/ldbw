(people v. adams (feb. 28, 2008, b193174) [nonpub. opn.].) he did not challenge the fines or victim restitution in his appeal. on february 28, 2014, adams filed a motion for modification of sentence, contending that the trial court imposed the $10,000 restitution fine and the $3,300 in victim restitution based on the erroneous assumption that [he] could pay [them] out of his earnings while incarcerated in state prison. he also filed a supplemental motion for modification. the trial court denied the motions. adams appealed. we appointed counsel to represent adams in the matter. after examining the record, counsel filed a wende brief raising no issues on appeal and requesting that we independently review the record. (people v. wende (1979) 25 cal.3d 436.) on september 16, 2014, we directed appointed counsel to immediately send the record on this appeal and a copy of the opening brief to adams and notified adams that within 30 days from the date of the notice he could submit by letter or brief any ground of appeal, contention or argument he wished us to consider. on september 29, 2014, adams filed a letter with this court attaching a copy of what he says is the supplemental motion he filed in the trial court in which he argues on several grounds that the fines and victim restitution are improper. we have examined the entire record, and reviewed adamss submission to this court, and see no basis to modify the imposed fines or victim restitution. the fines are within the statutory parameters, and although adams argues improprieties in the 3imposition of the fines and victim restitution, he does not support his arguments with evidence demonstrating error. we are satisfied that adamss attorneys have fully complied with their responsibilities and that no arguable appellate issue exists.
