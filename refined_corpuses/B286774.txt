(people v. manibusan (2013) 58 cal.4th 40, 87.) the record must contain substantial evidence to support the verdict, i.e., evidence that is reasonable, credible, and of solid value. (people v. maury (2003) 30 cal.4th 342, 403.) we draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the judgment and do not resolve credibility issues or evidentiary conflicts. (manibusan, at p. 87.) section 667.61, subdivisions (j)(1) and (l), provide that a defendant who commits, among other enumerated sex offenses, forcible sodomy under section 286, subdivision (c)(2)(b)3 against a child under the age of 14 is subject to a term of life in prison without the possibility of parole if one or more circumstances listed in subdivision (d) are found true, or if two or more circumstances listed in subdivision (e) are found true. personal infliction of bodily harm on a child under the age of 14 is one of the circumstances listed in subdivision (d).

(see  667.61, subd. (k).) according to from the very force necessary to commit the act of sodomy conduct consisting of contact between the penis of one person and the anus of another person. any sexual penetration, however slightst the buttocks and into the perianal area but does not require penetration beyond the perianal folds or anal people v. paz (2017) 10 cal.app.5th 1023, 1038.) section 286 does not require a defendant to inflict any physical injury on the victim for the crime of sodomy by force to be complete. (see  286, subds. (a), (c)(2)(b); calcrim no. 1030.) and defendant does not cite any cases that hold physical injury is an element of the crime of forcible sodomy. defendant to stop and tried to push him away. j.b. also testified after defendant penetrated him. when asked whhat he inflicted severe 7 defendant used more force than was necessary to complete the accordingly, sufficient evidence supports the jurydefendant personally inflicted bodily harm on a child under the age of 14 when he committed the forcible sodomy charged in count 10. disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports lavin, j. we concur: edmon, p.j. dhanidina, j.
