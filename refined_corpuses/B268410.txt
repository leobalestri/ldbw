ecs prison ministry of northern california program. in october 2012, defendant completed a 10-week violence prevention class. defendant also had some documentation of participating in a 12-step

his therapy and work towards rehabilitation. of an expert to conduct a psychological evaluation of defendant. the trial court granted the motion an. dr. defendant, and administered various predictive risk assessment tests. because defendant was classified as being developmentally disabled, dr. macomber administered two intelligence tests. defendant tested consistently at the level of iq 75, which is in the borderline intellectual functioning range. dr. macomber believed that defendant had a good relapse prevention plan. while impulsivity and behavioral control had been a age and maturity. defendant expressed repentance and remorse for his past criminal actions. dr. macomber administered various risk assessments, which revealed a low to moderate risk for potential future criminal behavior. dr. macomber concluded that defendant does not currently pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. defendant was accepted for post-release assistance by the amity foundation. he was eager to continue his 12-step program participation, and his sister was committed to providing him with a stable home upon his release. 7 dr. macomber also testified at the june 9, 2015 proposition 36 hearing.3 dr. macomber stated that defendant had completed more self-help groups than the average for third-strikers. while the majority of positive programming defendant had completed

noted that the higher the score, the greater the security risk. at the time of the hearing, the defendant was 52 years old, which statistically reduced his probability of recidivism. he also had various health problems. the prosecutor argued that defendant had a violent history. in addition, defendant had done little over the course of his prison commitment to work or obtain skills. defendant did not participate in any narcotics anonymous programs until after proposition 36 passed. the prosecution wa history of criminal activity, lack of job skills, prior record of drug abuse and lack of impulse control would lead to an unreasonable risk to the community. defense counsel argued that defendant worked when it was available to him and had not had a confrontation with another inmate since 2002. with the exception of one conversation in 1999, defendant had not had any gang involvement in 17 years. defense counsel emphasized that the defendant had been in therapy, sought help for his

regarding his robbery and manslaughter convictions showed that displaying little, if any impulse in particular, the 1988 manslaughter conviction raised serious concerns. it was a violent crime which resulted in the death of the victim. in addition, the evidence him. despite serving nine years in prison after his voluntary manslaughter conviction, -shortly after his release. 9 w, thereby rendering him an the trial court also reviewed term of incarceration and that he is simply unable to comply with prison rules, which tends to show he will be while the court considered the positive institutional programming in which [t] discussion of unreasonable risk of danger to public safety does not apply to proposition 36 proposition 36 petition, rproposition 47. a. background--propositions 36 and 47 the voters passed proposition 36 in 2012. proposition 36 modifies the three strikes law so that the minimum 25-year-to-life sentence may in most cases only be imposed in cases where the third or subsequent felony conviction is also a serious or violent felony.4 the proposition also grants defendants previously sentenced on a nonserious and nonviolent felony to a 25-year-to-life sentence under the three strikes law the right to petition for resentencing on that offense. ( 1170.126, subd. (b).) whether a defendant is entitled to resentencing under proposition 36 turns on (1) whether he is eligible for relief, and if so, (2) whether he is suitable for relief -- that is, 4 until 2012, the three strikes law required a trial court to impose a minimum sentence of 25 years to life for a defendant convicted of a felony if he or she had been  1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(a) & 667, subd. (e)(2)(a).) 10 in this case, the prosecution stipulated to the first criteria; thus, the remaining question was whether defendant posed an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. proposition 36 directs a trial court to consider: record of rehabilitation while incarcerated; and (3) any other evidence the court deems relevant in deciding whether a new sentence would result in an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. ( 1170.126, subd. (g).) two years after enacting proposition 36, the voters enacted proposition 47. ( 1170.126, effective nov. 7, 2012;  1170.18, effective nov. 5, 2014.) proposition 47 re-rug -- and theft-ble as a felony until a court reduces them to a misdemeanor) and ultimately sentenced as felonies. (people v. lynall (2015) 233 cal.app.4th 1102, 1108.) proposition 47 also allows individuals currently serving a sentence for a conviction to petition for a recall of that sentence. (1170.18, subd. (a).) similar to proposition 36, proposition 47 requires proposition 47, and (2) whether resentencing would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. ( 1170.18, subd. (b).) however, ps criteria for a finding that a defendant poses an specifies: this cthe petitioner will commit a new violent felony within the meaning of [subdivision (e)(2)(c)(iv)] of section 667. ( 1170.18, subd. (c).) in other words, rather than focus generally, a court evaluating a proposition 47 petition is to assess only whether there is an  1170.18, subd. (c).) 11 b. analysis the question of whether pproposition 36 petition is currently pending before our supreme court. (see ante, fn. 1.) we conclude that py to an evaluation under proposition 36. (see people v. esparza (2015) 242 cal.app.4th 726, 736-737 (esparza), abrogated by people v. cordova (2016) 248 cal.app.4th 543, 552, fn. 8, review granted aug. 31, 2016, s236179.)5 although the plain language of proposition 47 points to the conclusion that it applies to proposition 36, we find that there are compelling reasons to conclude that the voters did not intend punder proposition 36. first, subdivision (n) states: is intended to diminish or abrogate the finality of judgments in any case not falling within proposition 36 petition must grant that petition unless it finds an unreasonable risk that a ption. along similar lines, pn)pesparza, supra, 242 cal.app.4th at p. 737.) further, nothing in the legislative history of proposition 47 suggests that it was intended to alter the scope of proposition 36. neither the ballot materials nor the text of 5 most of the previously published decisions on this issue cannot be cited, either because they were unpublished to begin with or because the supreme court has granted review. (see cal. rules of court, rules 8.1115(a), 8.1105(e)(1).) esparza is an exception. in cordova, the sixth appellate district reversed its position on the issue. 12 proposition 47 mention an intent to use pproposition 36 or any other resentencing schemes. in addition, propositions 47 and 36 have different overarching goals. proposition 47 is designed to give lower-2014 cal. general election official voter information guide, p. 35), while proposition 36 is designed to give hardened criminals with at least two prior serious or violent convictions a reduced sentence on their third felony (from 25-to-life down to the usual sentence) ( 1170.126). these are different purposes. finally, the timing of papply it to penactment to file their petitions for resentencing. ( 1170.126, subd. (b).) proposition 47 was enacted two days shy of the closing of that window. ( 1170.18.) it seems unlikely that any rational voter would have intended to change the rules for proposition 36 petitions at the last moment, when nearly all petitions would already have been filed and most of them had already been adjudicated. for all these reasons, we decline to find that the trial court should have applied pproposition 36 case. ii. the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that defendant poses an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety under proposition 36 defendant argues that the trial court abused its discretion in determining that he would present an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety under the criteria set forth in section 1170.126, subdivisions (f) and (g). defendant asserts that the reasons for denying him resentencing did not rise to a level which should result in a finding of an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. defendant concedes that section 1170.26, subdivisions (f) and (g), confers on the trial court a discretionary power to make the resentencing determination. here, a discretionary power is statutorily vested in the trial court, its exercise of that 13 except on a showing that the court exercised its discretion in an arbitrary, capricious or patently absurd manner that resulted in a manifest miscarriage of justice. [citations. [citation.people v. rodrigues (1994) 8 cal.4th 1060, 1124-1125.) a. the trial court properly exercised its discretion after careful consideration of all relevant evidence the trial court issued a 12-on for resentencing. in its analysis, the trial court discussed the evidence relating to each statutory factor set forth in section 1170.126, subdivision (b). first, the court reviewed while the court noted that the facts violent and involved [defendant] displaying little, if the court discussed in detail the facts leading up to the 1988 manslaughter conviction, pointing out that defendant was able to leave the home of the victim after the first altercation, but upon reflection, returned with a gun and killed the victim. the court concluded that fendant had 14 cdcr rule violation reports documenting serious misconduct. the court observed that comply with prison rules, which tends to show he will be unable to fo programming, including narcotics anonymous meetings; mental health activities; and anger management. released from prison, thereby making him an unreasonable risk of danger to public 14 assessments by dr. walker and dr. macomber. reaction to stress and his lack of impulse control. a recent comment made by one of concern. in addition, the lack of a specific reentry and treatment plan raised serious concern regarding the risk of future violent behavior. the court also felt that the lack of regional center programming limited the likelihood that defendant would be able to transition back into society. cdcr classification score of 48 provided further evidence of his unsuitability for resentencing. the court considered d, and acknowledged that these factors may reduce the likelihood of defendant committing a violent offense. in addition, the court noted that defendant had been accepted into the amity foundation in conjunction with the los angeles county probatisubmitted a letter indicating that defendant was welcome to stay in her home, and that she would help defendant secure a job and attend any necessary programming. however, the court expressed its concern that defendant has no marketable skills that can be put to use the record demonstrates that, if resentenced, [defendant] would pose an unreasonable risk category of offender for which proposition relevant to each statutory factor. ( 1170.126, subd. (g).) the court also considered velopmental disability, his age, and his post-release plans. the trial court properly weighed all of the evidence and came to a rational conclusion. no abuse of discretion is apparent. 15 b. defendant has failed to show an abuse of discretion defendant argues that the trial court abused its discretion for several reasons. first, he contends that the crimes he committed were remote in time and that the court made no connection, or nexus, between the time the crimes were committed and the person defendant is today. defendant cites in re lawrence (2008) 44 cal.4th 1181, 1226, offense had no predictive value regarding her current threat to public safety, and thus provides no support for the . . . conclusion that petitioner is unsuitable for parole at the present we disagree. the sole basis for a finding of reveals that while it considered the seriousness of the crimes that defendant committed in the court found tduring the course of his prison term showed that defendant remains unable to follow rules and laws. next, defendant positive programming was too little too late. defendant does not cite to the specific we find that such an inference is not appropriate. the court acknowledged that e positive institutional activities, which indicate an enhactively engaged in mental health activities, group meetings, and was keeping up with his medical and mental health appointments. def certificates of completion for anger management and positive other programming between 2011 and 6 6 itation to in re lee (2006) 143 cal.app.4th 1400, 1414, for the proposition that a genuine acceptance of responsibility ought not to be rejected because it comes too late, is irrelevant. 16 defendant cites in re lee, supra, 143 cal.app.4th at page 1409, footnote 4, for the -year-old inmate, might . . it would not necessarily be some evidence of an unreasonable danger to at the tge the trial court properly considered this factor along with that the trial court gave insufficient weight to the evidence of defendant also argues that the court did not carefully consider the evidence acceptance into the amity foundation. defendant states, foundat again we find that there is no basis to assume that the court missed the letter. the court quoted verbatim from the letter when it noted that the letter does not expressly confirm acceptance, but indicates it has received information on the potential release of [defendant]. defendant had been accepted into the amity foundation program. the court properly foundation. however, the court in its discretion determined that the risk of danger to public safety was still too great. again, we disagree. the court explained that defendant had told dr. macomber that his triggers were feelings of frustration, anger, and disappointment. the court noted that this was concerning because defendant is likely to experience all of these triggers outside of prison. defendant states that the the trial court found no such thing. instead, the trial court acknowledged that dr. macomber ultimately concluded that defendant does not pose a risk of danger to society. the trial 17 court properly considered this in its careful evaluation of the factors under section 1170.126, subd. (g). pena. dr. pena described an event where defendant demonstrated good judgment by walking away from actions of another inmate that, in the past, would have triggered a violent response. defendant argues that this comment showed that defendant is now able to address these impulse control issues appropriately, and without violence. however, the trial court noted that this very recent comment indicates that these issues are still of concern. the trial court was entitled to infer dant does not always demonstrate such appropriate behavior, and that such restraint is a even n in determining that defendant still poses an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. evidence before it. no abuse of discretion occurred. c. remand for further information is not warranted certain respects. specifically, the report did not provide information regarding treatment and services that might be available to defendant after his release. the court stated: as indicated above, dr. walker was appoint[ed] to specifically address the general information provided by other witness[es] with regard to the fact that the [defendant] may be developmentally disabled and to provide information regarding treatment and services that are available ports proved [sic] the court with little specific information in these areas. provide the court with the information that it wanted. defendant asks this court to remand the matter so that the trial court can consider other possible services or appoint another expert to provide sufficient information to the court. defendant provides no 18 authority that such action is appropriate under the circumstances of this case, nor does defendant allege any specific error on the part of the trial court.7 unreasonable risk of danger to public safety, a remand for the purpose of exploring potential services available upon release is not warranted. as set forth in detail above, the trial court considered availability of treathat defendant continued to pose too great a risk of danger to society. no error occurred. disposition the order is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. ____________________________, j. chavez we concur: __________________________, p. j. boren __________________________, j. ashmann-gerst 7 if there were additional treatments or services that defendant wanted the court to be aware of, defendant could have presented such information to the trial court through additional evidence.
