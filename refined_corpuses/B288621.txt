(people v. inzunza (feb. 24, 1997, b102291) [nonpub. opn.] (inzunza i).) b. jury verdict and sentencing a jury convicted inzunza of possession of a firearm by a felon (former  12021, subd. (a)(1), now  29800, subd. (a)(1)) and being under the influence of a controlled substance (health & saf. code,  11550, subd. (a)). (inzunza i, supra, b102291.) in a bifurcated 1 all further statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise noted. 3 trial the jury found true the allegation inzunza suffered three prior robbery convictions, which were serious or violent felony convictions within the meaning of the three strikes law ( 667, subds. (b)-(i), 1170.12), and served six prior prison terms within the meaning of section 667.5, subdivision (b). (inzunza i, supra, b102291.) the trial court sentenced inzunza to 31 years to life, including 25 years to life for possession of a firearm by a felon, calculated as a third strike under the three strikes law, plus six consecutive one-year sentences for each of the prior prison terms pursuant to section 667.5, subdivision (b). (inzunza i, supra, b102291.) c. inzunza on november 30, 2012 inzunza filed a petition for recall of sentence under proposition 36. he argued possession of a firearm by a felon was an offense eligible for resentencing under proposition 36 ( 1170.126, subd. (e)(2); see  667, subd. (e)(2)(c)(i)-(iii), 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(c)(i)-(iii)), and none of his prior serious or violent felony convictions disqualified him from having his sentence recalled ( 1170.126, subd. (e)(3); see  667, subd. (e)(2)(c)(iv), 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(c)(iv)). the superior court issued an order to show cause why his sentence should not be recalled. the people filed an opposition, a supplemental opposition, and an amended supplemental opposition to the petition. the people contended inzunza was ineligible for resentencing under section 1170.126, commission of the current offense, the defendant . . . was armed with a firearm or deadly weapon . . .  667, subd. (e)(2)(c)(iii), 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(c)(iii).) the people also argued inzunza was unsuitable for resentencing given his criminal record and disciplinary history while in prison. in his reply brief, inzunza 4 asserted his possession of a firearm, absent a facilitative nexus to a separate offense, did not render him ineligible for resentencing. on february 26, 2018 the superior court held a hearing on inzunza2 at the beginning of the hearing the police, he had a loaded .25 caliber semi-automatic handgun in his pants. so i would find him ineligible. the firearm was readily available for offensive and defensive use and i would make that argument presented in his reply brief that inzunza was eligible for resentencing because his possession of a firearm was not tethered to a reasonable doubt [inzunza is] statutorily ineligible for recall[] and resentencing pursuant to penal code section 1170.126 because during the commission of the current offense, he was armed with a the court denied the petition. inzunza timely appealed. discussion a. the three strikes reform act of 2012 (proposition 36) prior to approval of proposition 36, the three strikes law provided that defendants who committed a felony and had two or more prior convictions for serious or violent felonies were to be sentenced to an indeterminate term of life imprisonment with a minimum term of at least 25 years. (former  1170.12, subds. (b), (c)(2)(a); people v. perez (2018) 4 cal.5th 1055, 1061-1062 (perez); people v. estrada (2017) 3 cal.5th 661, 666-667 (estrada).) 2 there were numerous extensions of the briefing schedule, and inzunza filed his reply brief on december 15, 2017. 5 following enactment of proposition 36, defendants are now subject to a lesser sentence when they have two or more prior strikes and are convicted of a felony that is neither serious nor violent, unless an exception applies.estrada, supra, 3 cal.5th at p. 667.) a defendant falls within one of the exceptions to eligibility used a firearm, was armed with a firearm or deadly weapon, or intended to cause great bodily injury to another person. 667, subd. (e)(2)(c)(iii), 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(c)(iii).) proposition 36 applies both prospectively and retroactively to defendants who were previously sentenced under the three strikes law. (estrada, supra, 3 cal.5th at p. for those sentenced under the scheme previously in force, [proposition 36] establishes procedures for convicted individuals to seek resentencing in accordance with the new sentencing rules. ( 1170.126.) the procedures call for two determinations. first, an inmate must be eligible for resentencing. ( 1170.126, subd. (e)(2).) an inmate is eligible for resentencing if his or her current sentence was not imposed for a violent or serious felony and was not imposed for any of the offenses described in clauses (i) to (iv) of section 1170.12, subdivision (c)(2)(c). ( 1170.126, subd. (e)(2).) those clauses describe certain kinds of criminal conduct, including the use of a firearm during the commission of the offense. second, an inmate (estrada, at p. 667.) on a petition for resentencing under proposition 36, the prosecutor must prove the defendant is ineligible for resentencing beyond a reasonable doubt. (perez, supra, 4 cal.5th at p. 1059; accord, people v. frierson (2017) 4 cal.5th 225, 230, 236 (frierson).) whether a defendant is ineligible for resentencing on undisputed facts is a pure question of law, which we review de novo. (in re r.t. (2017) 3 cal.5th 622, 627; people v. prunty (2015) 62 cal.4th 59, 71; 6 people v. bradford (2014) 227 cal.app.4th 1322, 1332 [construction of prop. 36 reviewed de novo].) b. a defendant may be ineligible for resentencing under proposition 36 for a conviction of possession of a firearm by a felon without a facilitative nexus to another offense commission of the current offense, the defendant . . . was armed with a firearm or deadly weapon . . .  667, subd.

(see people v. white (2016) 243 cal.app.4th possessory offenses as a basis for finding a defendant was armed for purposes of determining eligibility for resentencing relief . . . . people v. burnes (2015) 242 cal.app.4th 1452, 1458 [[a] person convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm is not automatically disqualified from resentencing by virtue of that conviction; such a person is disqualified only if he or she had the firearm available for offensive or defensive use.]; people v. hicks (2014) 231 cal.app.4th 275, 283-284 [affirming denial of resentencing petition for conviction of former  12021, subd.

(people v. blakely, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1052; osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1030.) as the court in osuna is searched and a firearm is found next to his bed. the parolee is in possession of the firearm, because it is under his dominion and control. if he is not home at the time, however, he is not armed with the firearm, because it is not readily available to him for offensive or defensive use. accordingly, possessing a firearm does osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1030.) in osuna, there was evidence that the defendant was holding a handgun when apprehended by the meaning of [proposition 36]. (ibid.) as our colleagues in osuna for resentencing under proposition 36 requires . . . that a conviction firearm for osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1038.) inzunza also cites bland that for the purpose of imposition of the firearm sentence enhancement under former section 12022, subdivision (a), there must be a 9 purpose or effect with respect to the drug trafficking crime . . . (bland, supra, 10 cal.4th at p. 1002.) however, the supreme court in estrada rejected the argument that a facilitative nexus requirement applies to what is more, section 1170.12, subdivision (c)(2)(c)(iii) provides only one express nexus requirement between these general descriptive terms and the d]uring suggests temporal overlap: something that occurs throughout the duration of an event or at some point in its course. [citation.] the term implies, at a minimum, a need for a temporal connection conviction. although the need to establish such a nexus imposes certain limits on the applicability of the firearm-related exception, [proposition 36] could certainly have imposed an even stricter requirement for triggering the exception. (see [bland, supra,] 10 cal.4th [at p.] 1002 because [proposition 36] does not do so, we may infer some kind of temporal limitation on the retroactive application of section estrada, supra, 3 cal.5th at p. 670; accord, cruz, supra, 15 cal.app.5th at pp. 1111-1112 [requires a temporal nexus between the osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1032 [same].) 10 c. the trial court did not err in finding inzunza was ineligible for resentencing because he had a firearm available for his offensive or defensive use during commission of the crime inzunza does not dispute he had a loaded handgun in his pants when the officers conducted a patdown search during his detention. stopped by the police, he had a loaded .25 caliber semi-automatic thus, inzunza was armed with a firearm bland, supra, 10 cal.4th at p. 997; accord, cruz, supra, 15 cal.app.5th at pp. 1109-1110.) disposition the order is affirmed. feuer, j. we concur: perluss, p. j. segal, j.
