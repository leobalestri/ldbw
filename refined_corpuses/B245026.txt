(d); undesignated statutory references are to the penal code). the trial court sentenced defendant to a term of 40 years to life in prison, consisting of 15 years to life for the murder plus 25 years to life for the section 12022.53, subdivision (d) enhancement. defendant appealed, alleging that the trial court erred by excluding evidence and that the firearm enhancement could not be imposed because it merged with the murder, its imposition violated section 654, and true findings under subdivisions (c) and (d) of section 12022.53 constituted multiple convictions of necessarily included offenses. claims, but modified the judgment to eliminate presentence conduct credits pursuant to section 2933.2. (people v. vasquez (may 28, 2003, b158614) [nonpub. opn.].) judgment/application for the writ of error coram novis [sicmotion alleged the following claims: (1) people who should have been disqualified for bias served as jurors in his trial, including law enforcement officers, people related to law enforcement officers, people who had prior jury service, and a former district attorney who knew the prosecutor, defense counsel, and the judge; (2) jurors were prejudiced by double jeopardy, section 654, apprendi v. new jersey (2000) 530 u.s. 466 [120 s.ct. 2348], and blakely v. washington (2004) 542 u.s. 296 [124 s.ct. 2531]; (4) the trial court misinstructed the jury using caljic nos. 2.90 and 17.41.1; (5) defense counsel did not advise him of his right to testify and the trial court did not take his waiver of his right to testify until after it had instructed the jury about him not testifying; (6) the prosecutor violated a rule of professional conduct and brady v. maryland (1963) 373 u.s. 83 [83 s.ct. 1194] by withholding evidence of the absence of flight, failing to introduce some of the evidence found at th 3 trial courtpunishment and in violation of apprendi v. new [j]ersey, rule, and penal code section  654 we appointed counsel to represent vasquez on appeal. after examination of the record, counsel filed an opening brief raising no issues and asking this court to independently review the record. on february 20, 2013, vasquez filed his supplemental brief arguing some of the same claims as in his petition and adding a claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel for failing to raise on appeal the claims raised herein. to place this case in the proper procedural posture, we deem vasquezo be an original petition in this court for a writ of error coram vobis. (people v. brady ruling on petition for writ of error coram nobis properly treated as coram vobis petition in the appellate court].) a writ of coram nobis or coram vobis is a narrow remedy used to secure relief when no other remedy exists. (people v. adamson (1949) 34 cal.2d 320, 326.) in order to obtain relief the petitioner must establish the existence of some fact that, without his fault or negligence, was not presented to the court at the trial and would have prevented the rendition of the judgment; that the new evidence does not go to the merits of the issues of fact determined at trial; and that he did not know nor could he have, with due diligence, discovered the facts upon which he relies any earlier than the time he filed his petition for the writ. (people v. kim (2009) 45 cal.4th 1078, 1093 (kimerror coram nobis is not a catch-all by which those convicted may litigate and relitigate the propriety of their convictions ad infinitum. in the vast majority of cases a trial 4 followed by a motion for a new trial and an appeal affords adequate protection to those accused of crime. the writ of error coram nobis serves a limited and useful purpose. it will be used to correct errors of fact which could not be corrected in any other manner. but it is well-settled law in this and in other states that where other and adequate remedies exist the writ is not availabkim, supra, 45 cal.4th at p. 1094.) in addition, a coram nobis or coram vobis petition may raise only errors of fact, not errors of law. (id. at p. 1093.) nor may such a petition be based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. (id. at p. 1104.) a petition for writ of coram nobis or coram vobis may not determined; nor for alleged false testimony at the trial; nor on the ground that a juror swore falsin re lindley (1947) 29 cal.2d 709, 726.) the claims vasquez asserts are legal in nature, not factual, and they either were or could have been raised in his appeal. alternatively, they could have been raised in a timely petition for a writ of habeas corpus following the filing of the appellate opinion in b158614. indeed, vasquez filed a habeas corpus petition in this court in 2006, raising all of the claims raised herein, including ineffective assistance of appellate counsel. we denied that petition. (people v. vasquez (feb. 8, 2006, b188208) [nonpub. order].) because vasquez had other remedies and his claims are not based upon a newly discovered fact, his claims are not a proper basis for a petition for writ of error coram nobis or coram vobis. in addition, to demonstrate diligence, a petition for a writ of error coram nobis or coram vobis must allege the time and circumstances under which the petitioner discovered the new facts. (kim, supra, 45 cal.4th at pp. 10961097.) in his supplemental appellate brief vasquez asserts that he was diligent because inmates he due to their lack of knowledge owhen and how vasquez discovered some new fact forming the basis for his motion or 5 petition. all of the facts upon whknown to vasquez at the time of judgment in 2002. g justification, any issue that was actually raised and rejected on appeal cannot be renewed in a petition for a in re harris strong justification, issues that could be raised on appeal must initially be so presented, ibid.) we further note that all of have been raised in his appeal, vasquez previously raised his claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel in a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, and we rejected that claim. fully complied with his responsibilities and that no arguable issues exist.
