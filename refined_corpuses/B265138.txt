(e)(2)(c)(iii), 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(c)(iii)). this finding is legally sound and supported by substantial evidence. the court correctly applied the lesser preponderance of the evidence rather than the greatest beyond a reasonable doubt stanqualifies as ne to this appeal. background shoyne riggins testified that in september 1998 she lived in the same hotel as defendant, steven adams, and thomas fuller. riggins worked as a caregiver for 1 all further section references are to the penal code unless otherwise indicated. 2 the three strikes reform act of 2012 . . . . proposition 36 reduced the punishment to be imposed with respect to some third strike offenses that are neither serious nor violent, and provided for discretionary resentencing in some cases in which third strike sentences were imposed people v. johnson (2015) 61 cal.4th 674, 679.) proposition 36 was effective on november 7, 2012. (johnson, at p. 680.) 3 saundra p., an elderly handicapped woman. on september 5, 1998, riggins heard let me by.defendant, then in a wheelchair, block d purse. on september 28, 1998, riggins, threw dog out of the communal kitchen. defendant entered and yelled at riggins for doing so. riggins argued she did not want the dog present while she was cooking. fuller and adams argued on behalf of riggins. defendant pushed over the refrigerator, frightening riggins. fuller left. defendant grabbed which caused a small cut on her finger, and pointed the knife at riggins, stating you better watch it or he then pointed the knife man, you know outside the hotel. riggins described the paring knife as having a one- to two-inch blade. adams testified that after defendant grabbed the knife from riggins, he made a stabbing motion toward adams, called him him, and backed adams out of the hotel. the paring knife had a two- to four-inch blade. defendant was charged with attempted robbery ( 664, 211; count 1); sexual battery by restraint ( 243.4, subd. (a); count 2), and three counts of assault with a deadly weapon or by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury ( 245, subd. (a)(1); counts 3, 4, & 5). it was alleged that he used a knife during his commission of the attempted robbery ( 12022, subd. (b)(1)), that he had two prior convictions that were qualifying prior felony convictions (strikes) under the three strikes law ( 667, subds. (b)-(i), 1170.12, subds. (a)-(d)), that one of those prior convictions was a prior serious felony conviction within the meaning of section 667, subdivision (a)(1), and that he had served two prior prison terms ( 667.5, subd. (b)). it also was alleged saundra p. was the victim in counts 1 and 2; shoyne riggins was the victim in count 3; steven adams was the victim in count 4; and thomas fuller was the victim in count 5. a jury convicted defendant of one count of assault with a deadly weapon (knife) and by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury (count 4), a felony. on count 3, the jury acquitted him of felonious assault, but convicted him of the lesser 4 included offense of simple assault ( 240), a misdemeanor. the jury acquitted defendant of the remaining charges. the trial court found the prior conviction allegations true. defendant was sentenced to a total prison term of 25 years to life as a third striker on count 4.3 on july 15, 2013, defendant filed his proposition 36 petition to recall his sentence and for resentencing. on october 21, 2013, the proposition 36 court issued an order to show cause. the people filed opposition to the petition. defendant filed a reply, and the people filed a supplemental brief. on june 15, 2015, following a hearing, the proposition 36 court denied the commission of the current offense. discussion 1. does not preclude armed finding by proposition 36 court defendant was armed with a deadly weapon (knife) is unsupported by the record of circumstances people v. guerrero (1988) 44 cal.3d 343, 355. we find his contention to be without merit. jury did not specifically find the assault was committed solely with a deadly weapon is inconsequential. in people v. newman (2016) 2 cal.app.5th 718, this court explained a because [such factors] do not cause an increase in punishment beyond the statutory 3 the above background is taken from the earlier unpublished opinion (b139679), of which we take judicial notice. (evid. code,  452, subd. (d)(1), 459.) 5 punishment for the current would render a defendant ineligible for resentencing under proposition 36, which would lessen his punishment if he were eligible, is a determination solely within the province of the proposition 36 court to make without regard to any factual finding by the trier of newman, at. p. 724.) further, we explained that guerrero is guerrero, which was decided long before enactment of proposition 36, concerns what evidence a trial court may consider in determining the truth of a prior conviction newman, at. p. 726.) 2. armed with a deadly weapon finding is supported by substantial evidence ]iven the ambiguous state of the facts underlying [his] deadly weapon was not shown in this case, and the factual findings of the proposition 36 court are reviewed for substantial evidence. (people v. dove (2004) 124 cal.app.4th 1, 10; people v. johnson (2003) 114 cal.app.4th 284, 290.) under the applicable review standard, we examine the evidence, both direct and circumstantial, in light of the entire record and must indulge in favor of the order all presumptions as well as every logical inference that the court could have drawn from the evidence. (people v. maury (2003) 30 cal.4th 342, 396; people v. carter (2005) 36 cal.4th 1114, 1156; people v. ochoa (1993) 6 cal.4th 1199, 1206.) the factual findings of the . . . court that people v. robinson (2010) 47 cal4th 1104, 1126.) based on our review of the record, which includes pertinent portions of the e substantial evidence supports the during the commission of the current offense. the evidence at trial established that directly after wrestling the paring knife from riggins, defendant approached adams, 6 holding the knife above his head and making a stabbing motion while threatening to hurt and kill adams. adams backed away and exited the kitchen and the hotel. adams and riggins each testified defendant had come within six inches of adams. defendant does not challenge this evidence. rather, his contention that no deadly s testimony that the blade of the knife was one to two inches long. he suggests that the to be a deadly weapon and that such finding would be justified. as authority, he cites in re brandon t. (2011) 191 cal.app.4th 1491, 1496butter knife was a deadly weapon. initially, we point out the evidence before the proposition 36 court included s description of that knife as having a two- to four-inch blade. at the hearing, in discussing count 3, the misdemeanor assault on riggins, that court, who was not the trial court, stated its belief the record reflected the knife defendant used to threaten riggins - to two-alert the court that, as to the subject felony assault with a deadly weapon against adams (count 4), adams described the blade as between two to four inches. if the court had known this to be the case, the court would have credited adamsriggins, bec-inch blade further, as a general matter, a butter knife is used to separate a bar of butter into pats and spreading a pat around a slice of bread. this function is a far cry from that of a paring knife, which is used not only to peel a fruit or vegetable but also to cut those items into slices or chunks. in any event, whether a knife qualifies as a deadly weapon is not determined simply by the length of its blade and/or its functionas used in section 245, subdivision (a)(1), a deadly weapon is any object, instrument, or weapon which is used in such a manner as to be capable of producing and likely to produce, death or great bodily injury. 7 people v. aguilar (1997) 16 cal.4th 1023, 1028-1029, italics added.) this definition applies across the board unless a specific statutory definition is implicated. (people v. page (2004) 123 cal.app.4th 1466, 1472.) the act here does not define defendant approached within six inches of adams while holding the knife above his head and made a stabbing motion, accompanied by an express threat to kill adams. riggins believed defendant was trying to injure him, and adams felt sufficiently threatened to leave not only the kitchen but also the hotel itself. 3. preponderance of the evidence is the applicable standard of review defendant contends the proposition 36 court applied the incorrect standard of proof in making its factual findings, because the appropriate standard is beyond a reasonable doubt, as enunciated by the court in people v. arevalo (2016) 244 cal.app.4th 836, not preponderance of the evidence. we are not persuaded. in people v. frierson (2016) 1 cal.app.5th 788, the court disagreed with arevalo and concluded the correct standard of proof is preponderance of the evidence. (frierson, at pp. 793, 794.) in newman, this court concurred with that conclusion. we noted g guilt or innocence of a charged crime but not sentencing,issue involves a factual finding that might subject a defendant to a potential sentence greater than that authorized by the verdict of the trier of fact itself. (2 cal.app.5th at p. 731.) we held the preponderance of the evidence standard applied, because (id. at p. 732), the scenario in apprendi v. new jersey (2000) 530 u.s. 466, 490.) 4. status of current convictiis not germane felony or not, thus, the determination as to whether or not [he] was convicted under the deadly weapon theory or the gbi theory in count 4 is 8 tion in that count is not germane to this appeal. in opposition to the petition, the people alternatively argued defendant was ineligible for relief under proposition 36 in that his current offense was a serious felony, because he personally used a deadly weapon. the proposition 36 court, however, did not find defendant ineligible for this reason. rather, the court found him ineligible based on the specific, enumerated disqualifying factor that during the commission of the current offense, defendant was armed with a deadly weapon, a knife.

(c)(2)(c)(iii).) disposition the order appealed from is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. boren, p.j. we concur: ashmann-gerst, j. chavez, j.
