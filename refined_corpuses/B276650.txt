(b)(1); count 1) and second degree robbery ( 211; count 2). as to both counts, it was alleged a principal (blue) was personally armed with a handgun ( 12022.53, subds. (b), (e)(1)) and, though russell was not personally armed, he knew that blue was armed ( 12022, subd. (d)). in addition, blue was charged with possession of a firearm by a felon ( 29800, subd. (a)(1); count 3), assault with a firearm ( 245, subd. (a)(2); count 5) and making criminal threats ( 422, subd. (a); count 6).2 as to count 5, it was alleged that blue personally used a handgun. ( 12022.5, subd. (a).) it was further alleged blue had a prior serious and/or violent felony conviction (carjacking) within the meaning of sections 667, subdivision (a)(1), and was subject to the three strikes law ( 667, subds. (b)-(j), 1170.12), and served a prior prison term ( 667.5). b. the kidnapping and robbery evidence at trial on january 29, 2015, at around 2:20 a.m., kristopher giles was working as the cashier in a gas station convenience store 1 all statutory references are to the penal code. 2 counts 4 and 7 were not charged in the information. count 8 (conspiracy,  182) was dismissed on the p( 1385). 4 located in lancaster. he was speaking with a customer when he saw blue enter the store. once the customer left, blue approached the cash register, pulled out a gun and ordered giles to put the money in a bag. scared for his life, giles told blue he being a father might convince blue not to shoot him. while emptying the register, giles saw russell walk in and grab items from the store shelves.3 giles gave blue all the money from the register, which totaled around $40.4 blue ordered giles to give him the money from the safe, but giles explained it was a floor safe, drilled into the ground, and he did not have access to it. blue accused giles of lying. gun in hand, blue repeatedly demanded the money, and giles repeatedly said he could not retrieve the money. blue walked giles at gunpoint to the office in the back of the store. blue searched for more money, but did not find any. blue told giles to get on his knees. giles pleaded for his life. if giles were lying about the money, blue said he would come back ad with the gun barrel.5 3 several surveillance cameras recorded the robbery. the jury watched portions of the video surveillance tapes throughout 4 cashier was not to keep more than $40 in the register. 5 there were no surveillance cameras inside the office, so what transpired in the office was not recorded. cameras did record blue and giles (and russell) going into and out of the office/storage room. 5 blue forced giles to return to the front of the store where, (newport menthol), cigars (swishers) and scratchers (lotto tickets) into a bag. blue handed the bag to russell, and the two were about to walk out of the store when blue noticed a camera. russell left, but blue stayed behind to inquire about the surveillance cameras. giles explained the cameras were operated from the storage room next to the back office. blue ordered giles across the store and told him to turn off the cameras. when they reached the back office, giles showed blue the surveillance equipment and explained he could not deactivate the cameras or erase the footage. blue was nervous, aggressive and angry with giles. blue demanded to know the truth. he waived the gun about and pointed it directly at giles. finally, blue told giles to give him ten minutes before calling the police and left the store.6 neither russell nor blue presented any evidence at trial.7 6 giles called 911, and the defendants were arrested a short time later. 7 both defendants moved to dismiss the aggravated pursuant to section 1118.1 on the ground the prosecution failed to meet its burden of proof on the asportation element of kidnapping for robbery. the trial court denied the motions. after the jury reached its verdicts, blue moved for a new trial ( 1181) on count 1, arguing again that the evidence of asportation was insufficient. the trial court denied the motion. 6 c. the verdict and sentencing the jury found russell guilty of kidnapping to commit robbery and robbery, and found true the allegation russell knew a principal was armed within the meaning of section 12022, subdivision (d). the court sentenced russell to a term of life imprisonment with the possibility of parole, with a minimum period of confinement of seven years, on the aggravated kidnapping count ( 209, subd. (b)(1), 3046, subd. (a)(1)); an additional one-year term for the section 12022, subdivision (a)(1) enhancement, which was stayed pursuant to section 654; and the upper term of five years on the robbery count ( 211), which was also stayed pursuant to section 654. the jury found blue guilty of kidnapping for robbery, robbery, and possession of a firearm by a felon. the jury found true the allegation that he personally used a handgun within the meaning of section 12022.53, subdivision (b). blue was acquitted of assault and making criminal threats. after admitting his prior conviction, the court sentenced blue to a total effective sentence of 29 years to life, calculated as follows: on the aggravated robbery count ( 209, subd. (b)(1); count 1), life imprisonment with the possibility of parole, with a minimum period of confinement of seven years ( 3046, subd. (a)(1)), doubled under the three strikes law ( 667, subds. (b)-(j), 1170.12) to life imprisonment with the possibility of parole and a minimum period of confinement of 14 years, plus an additional 10 years for the personal use enhancement ( 12022.53, subd. (b)), plus another five years pursuant to section 667, subdivision (a)(1). on the robbery count ( 211; count 2), the trial court sentenced blue to the upper term of five years, doubled pursuant to the three strikes law to 10 years, but stayed the imposition of sentence 7 pursuant to section 654. the court sentenced blue to the upper term of three years on count 3 ( 29800), doubled pursuant to the three strikes law to six years, but stayed the imposition of sentence on this count as well ( 654). discussion a. standard of review in reviewing a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, we examine the record in the light most favorable to the judgment (people v. nelson (2011) 51 cal.4th 198, 210), and the record contains substantial evidence[meaning] evidence that is reasonable, credible, and of solid valuefrom which a reasonable jury could find the accused guilty people v. vines (2011) 51 cal.4th 830, 869 (vines . . presume in support of the judgment the existence of every fact the jury could reasonably have deduced from the evidence. . . we resolve neither credibility issues nor evidentiary conflicts. . . upon no hypothesis whatever is there sufficient substantial (people v. zamudio (2008) 43 cal.4th 327, 357; accord, people v. ochoa (1993) 6 cal.4th 1199, 1206.) applying this standard, we find the 8 asportation evidence sufficient to support the convictions for aggravated kidnapping.8 b. legal principles of kidnapping to commit robbery who kidnaps or carries away any individual to commit robbery, rape [or other specified crime] . . . shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for life with the possibility of only movement of the victim is [(1)] beyond that merely incidental to the commission of, and [(2)] increases the risk of harm to the victim over and above that necessarily present in, the intended underlying 9 (people v. simmons 8 kidnapping for robbery is commonly referred to as aggravated kidnapping.

(washington, supra, 127 cal.app.4th at pp. 295-296.) once the vault was open, the defendants took the cash inside and left.

(id. at pp. 602, 607.) after gathering the jewelry, he returned to the back, threatened the victims and pulled the office phone out of the wall and left. (id. at p. 602.) the hoard kidnapping convictions, concluding the forced movement of the victims was merely incidental to the robbery because it served only to facilitate the crime (providing free access to the jewelry 13 and concealing the robbery from the public) with no other apparent purpose.11 (id. at p. 607.) the facts in this case are readily distinguishable from the foregoing cases. unlike the defendants in washington, williams and hoard, blue forcibly moved giles after the purpose of the robbery had been achieved. with the stolen money and merchandise in hand, blue and russell were about to leave the store when blue saw the cameras. the robbery completed, russell left the store. blue, however, stayed behind and ordered giles across the store to dismantle the surveillance equipment. as blue and russell concede, the second forced movement was for . . the in excess of that necessary to commit the robbery.

(see, e.g., people v. james, supra, 148 cal.app.4th at p. 455 & fn. which was necessary to, and facilitative of, a robbery must necessary to a robbery may or may not be merely incidental to people v. aguilar (2004) 120 cal.app.4th 1044, 1047, 1051, 1052 [noting hoard .) 14 people v. james, supranecessity is a sufficient basis to conclude a movement is not movement that is unnecessary and gratuitous is not incidental to the robbery. a case on point is people v. corcoran (2006) 143 cal.app.4th 272. in corcoran, the defendants intended to rob a bingo hall where five people were working, but one employee escaped and called for help. the defendants aborted the robbery and moved the remaining four victims 10 feet into an office at the back of the bingo hall with no windows and a solid door. (id. at pp. 276, 279.) the corcoran court distinguished washington excess or gratuitous movement of the victims over and above that necessary to obtain the mid., at p. 279, quoting washington, supra, 127 cal.app.4th at p. 299.) the court also distinguished hoard because, in that case, forcing two jewelry store employees to the back of the store gave the defendant free access to the jewelry. (corcoran, at p. 280, citing hoard, supra, 103 cal.app.4th at p. 607.) in corcoran, however, taking cash from the bingo hall; [the] defendant and his accomplice had aborted that aim, and their seclusion of the victims in the back office under threat of death was clearly corcoran, at pp. 279-280.) gravailable cash and merchandise) had been achieved. accordingly, as to the first element, there was sufficient evidence from which a 15 merely incidental to the commission of the crime. turning to the second element (increased risk of harm), the the front of the store was all glass, and customers continued to enter the store during the robbery.12 by taking giles to the back room, blue moved him out of plain sight, thereby decreasing his chances of being caught. (see people v. leavel, supra, 203 cal.app.4th at p. 836 [forcing the victim back inside her house after taking her outside escape or rescue, and enhanced his opportunity to commit people v. corcoran, supra, 143 back office except to facilitdecreasing odds of detection, increasing risk of harm to the by moving giles to the back of the store and out of sight, f being harmed. indeed, in this back room, blue ordered giles to his knees, threatened to kill him and pistol whipped him. (see people v. dominguez, supra, 39 cal.4th at p. 1152 [risk factors include to people v. lara (1974) 12 cal.3d 903, 12 during the robbery, two people came into the convenience store and left without incident: a female security guard from another business and a man in a vest, who used the bathroom. 16 people v. jones (1999) 75 cal.app.4th 616, 629-630 [forcing the victim across the parking lot to her car after taking her wallet and keys increased her risk of harm].) when blue ordered giles through the store the second time, the risk of harm increased further. unlike hoardup in the back office where they could not try to thwart the robbery than had they remained at gunpoint in the front of the hoard, supra, 103 cal.app.4th at p. 607), in the present case blue continued to use the gun to threaten giles as he forced him to move to the back of the store a second time. blue had giles with a gun minutes earlier. (people v. jones, supra, 75 people v. james, supra and giles of lying about the surveillance system, and demonstrated his anger and frustration by threatening giles further with the gun. given that during his first trip to the storage room, giles was threatened and pistol whipped, this second forced movement to the back of the store carried with it not only the increased risk of physical harm, but also the increased risk of psychological injury. (see people v. nguyen, supra, 22 cal.4th at p. 886 can satisfy the asportation requirement].) . . viewing the evide 17 (people v. corcoran, supra, 143 cal.app.4th at p. 280), incidental to the robbery and i d. blue is entitled to resentencing on the gun enhancement -year firearm enhancement pursuant to section 12022.53, subdivision (b). at the time of the sentencing, the enhancement was mandatory and could not be stricken in the interest of justice. (see former  12022.53, subd. (h), stats. 2010, ch. 711,  5; people v. felix (2003) 108 cal.app.4th 994, 999.) on october 11, 2017, the governor signed senate bill no. 620, which as relevant here, amends section 12022.53 to provide the trial court with the discretion to strike, in the interest of justice, a firearm enhancement allegation found to be true under that statute.13 effective january 1, 2018, section 12022.53, submay, in the interest of justice pursuant to section 1385 and at the time of sentencing, strike or dismiss an enhancement otherwise required to be imposed by this section. the authority provided by this subdivision applies to any resentencing that may occur 14 (stats. 2017, ch. 682,  2(h).) 13 similarly, the bill also amends section 12022.5, subdivision (c), to give the trial court the authority to strike a firearm enhancement when a true finding is made under section 12022.5. 14 regular session of the legislature generally becomes effective on 18 based upon the passage of senate bill no. 620, blue seeks resentencing on the gun enhancement. blue argues, citing in re estrada (1965) 63 cal.2d 740, 746, that the amendment to section 12022.53 applies because his case will not be final when the new statutes become effective on january 1, 2018. under estrada, courts presume that absent evidence to the contrary, the legislature intends an amendment reducing punishment under a criminal statute to apply retroactively to cases not yet final on appeal. (in re estrada, at pp. 747-748; people v. brown (2012) 54 cal.4th 314, 324 [estrada is properly understood in a specific easonable presumption that a legislative act mitigating the punishment for a particular the estrada rule has been applied not only to amendments reducing the penalty for a particular offense, but also to amendments giving the court the discretion to impose a lesser penalty.

[citations.] defendants are entitled to of its discretionary authority cannot exercise its informed people v. brown (2007) 147 cal.app.4th 1213, 1228; accord, people v. gutierrez which is unaware of the scope of its discretionary powers can no more exercise that is or may have been based on misinformation regarding a matter must be remanded to allow the trial court to properly exercise its discretion unlexercised its discretion even if it believed it could do so . . . (people v. gamble (2008) 164 cal.app.4th 891, 901.) in the present case, the record does not demonstrate that court identified several aggravating factors warranting imposition of the upper end of the base term for counts 2 and 3, ion the court would have imposed the additional 10 years for the firearm 20 enhancement on count 1 if it had the discretion not to do so.15 (see people v. deloza (1998) 18 cal.4th 585, 599-600 [case remanded for resentencing where court understood its discretion to strike a prior conviction under the three strikes law and declined to do so, but did not understand it had discretion to impose concurrent rather than consecutive sentences].) accordingly, the trial court must be given the opportunity to exercise its discretion under senate bill no. 620. the amendments pursuant to senate bill no. 620 allow the court to strike not only firearm use enhancements under section 12022.5 and section 12022.53, subdivision (b), but also enhancements under section 12022.53, subdivisions (c) and (d), which involve the discharge of a firearm and the discharge of a crimes were serious, the legislature determined that even in cases involving shootings, injuries and death, striking the enhancement may be appropriate depending upon the individual circumstances of the case. according to the author of the bill, when applying a firearm sentence enhancement, at the time a person is convicted for committing a felony. this is consistent with other sentence enhancement laws and retains existing sanctions for serious crimes. [] []right now these sentences are imposed as a mandate, regardless of the circumstances of a 15 in selecting the upper term the court identified the following factors: the likelihood of great bodily injury in the behavior; and the fact that blue was on probation for a violent felony when the crime occurred. 21 crime. if for some valid reason a court wanted to impose a lesser sentence they cannot.
