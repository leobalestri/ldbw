possession of a short-barreled rifle or shotgun. leffler response to one of the jury questions was erroneous, and requires reversal of his conviction for possessing a billy. we disagree, and affirm the judgment. factual and procedural background 1. facts on october 19, 2016, at approximately 3:45 p.m., los aexecuted a search warrant at 9104 alondra boulevard in the city of bellflower, a vacant storefront located in a strip mall. when deputies entered, leffler was alone on the premises, in the vicinity of a large safe. evidence indicated leffler was living at the location and had access to the safe.1 inside the safe, detectives discovered a collapsible metal baton and an unregistered, sawed-off shotgun. the baton was comprised of three pieces. it could be telescoped out with a flick of the wrist, and collapsed by striking it on a hard surface. during cross-examination, a detective testified that he had observed leffler acting as a security guard at various events in the city of bellflower. however, he had never seen leffler 1 a room in the back of the business contained furniture, a bed, clothing, and a bathroom. a minivan registered to leffler was parked outside the business. leffler told the deputies that he had a key to the b a wallet containing a as located on a desk in the room, along with a key to the safe. the safe. 3 carrying a baton. another detective testified that he did not know whether a security guard was allowed to carry a baton. the defense presented no evidence. 2. procedure the jury convicted leffler of possession of a billy or blackjack (pen. code,  22210)2 and possession of a short-barreled rifle or shotgun ( 33210). the trial court suspended imposition of sentence and placed leffler on formal probation for a period of three years, on condition he serve 180 days in county jail. it imposed a restitution fine, a suspended probation revocation restitution fine, a court operations assessment, and a criminal conviction assessment. leffler appeals. discussion the trial court did not commit prejudicial instructional error 1. additional facts the trial court instructed the jury with caljic no. 12.40, regarding illegal possession of a billy or blackjack. that possesses any weapon of the kind commonly known as a blackjack, leaded club or billy club is guilty of a violation of penal 3 2 all further undesignated statutory references are to the penal code. 3 the instruction also defined actual and constructive possession, and the court additionally gave caljic no. 1.24, to the same effect. leffler does not dispute that he possessed the collapsible baton and the short-barreled shotgun. 4 the verdict form provided to the jury for count 1, possession of a billy, u, the jury in the above-entitled action, find the defendant, cody william leffler, guilty of the crime of possession of a billy[,] blackjack, etc[.], in violation of penal code section 22210, a felony as (some capitalization omitted.) during deliberations, the jury sent a note to the trial court, apparently referencing the verdict form language. the consulting with the parties, the trial court proposed that it would answer yes to the first question, and no to the second. defense counsel opined that security guards, as well as peace officers, were legally permitted to carry batons. the prosecutor [t]here are certain kinds of security guards and theunfamiliar with the specifics of the law. because proceedings were about to conclude for the day, the trial court took the matter under consideration. the following day, the court observed that under section 22295, subdivision (b), a uniformed security guard was not prohibited from carrying a wooden club or baton under certain circumstances. the court indicated it would so inform the jury. in , the court indicated it would inform the jury that a metal collapsible baton included in or request any additional instruction or clarification. afternoon you submi5 to that statutean anyone legally carry a collapindicate this to you; that section 22295(b) of the california penal code provides that uniformed security guards regularly employed may carry wooden 2. discussion leffler contends the trial court prejudicially erred by on was a billy or blackjack answer relieved the prosecution of proving an element of the offense, and the court should have further instructed the jury to consider the totality of the circumstances regarding his possession of the baton. we discern no error and no prejudice. a trial court has a sua sponte duty to instruct the jury on the general principles of law relevant to the issues raised by the evidence, including the elements of a charged offense. (people v. townsel (2016) 63 cal.4th 25, 58; people v. mil (2012) 53 cal.4th 400, 409; people v. baugh (2018) 20 cal.app.5th 438, 442 (baugh).) when a jury asks a question after retiring for deliberations, section 1138 requires that the court provide information the jury desires on points of law. (people v. boyce (2014) 59 cal.4th 672, 699700; people v. hodges (2013) 213 cal.app.4th 531, 539.) we independently determine whether the instructions given correctly stated the law, and whether an instruction effectively directed a finding adverse to a defendant (people v. baugh, at p. 442; people v. ramos (2008) 163 cal.app.4th 1082, 1088.) 6 section 222104 e, or any instrument or weapon of the kind commonly known as a 5 a a bludgeon, as one for carrying in the pocket; a .

(ibid.) 7 necessary, and which may also be known as a baton or truncheon (vocabulary.com, 2018 (<http://www.vocabulary.com.html> [as of august 208 (<http://www.oed.com.html> [as of august 20, 2018].) . language, it has long been held that the statute encompasses a variety of bludgeoning instruments.

(id. at p. 213.) rejecting this argument, the court reasoned that, although the item was more precisely defined as a slungshot, it nonetheless qualified as a kind of blackjack. (id. at p. 214.) the court explaindefinite. it is significant that the legislature did not prohibit possession of a black-jack as such, a slung-shot, as such, a billy, as such, or of a sand-club, a sand-bag, or even metal knuckles, as it might have done, but instead, and very likely with appreciation of the difficulties of nomenclature, forbade ownership of any instrument undoubtedly was to outlaw instruments which are ordinarily 8 id. at p. 215; see people v. fannin (2001) 91 cal.app.4th 1399, 1402; people v. canales (1936) 12 cal.app.2d 215, 217.) people v. mercer (1995) 42 cal.app.4th supp. 1, concluded that a collapsible baton of the type at issue here was a billy for purposes of the statute. the collapsible baton was id. at p. 5.) with a flick of the wrist, it could be extended and used as a club. (ibid.) the dictionary definitions of billy included, among other things, a club or heavy stick; a any staff or baton of authority.(ibid.) the collapsible baton, mercer ibid.) moreover, former section 12020 provided that law enforcement officers were not prohibited from carrying wooden clubs or batons, nor was it unlawful to supply such batons to officers or certain uniformed security guards. use of d the court that possession of the collapsible baton was proscribed by former section 12020. (people v. mercer, at p. supp. 6.; see  22215, 22295.) likewise qualified as a billy or blackjack for purposes of section 22210. like the baton in mercer, it could be extended with a flick of the wrist into a striking instrument. its only apparent purpose was to serve as a bludgeon or cudgel. leffler does not dispute that his collapsible baton could qualify as a billy within the meaning of the statute, although he argues that most dictionary definitions describe the item as made of wood. however, he complains that the trial court should have left that determination to the jury. not so. where there is no 9 used for an innocent purpose, the question of whether an item is for the court, rather than a question of fact for the jury. (people v. mayberry, supra, 160 cal.app.4th at p. 169 & fn. 5.) in mayberry, the defendant was convicted of violating former section 12020 based on his possession of a standard weighted workout glove that contained sand in the palm. the appellate court concluded that such a glove was not a sandclub or sandbag within the meaning of the statute. (id. at p. 167.) the court explained: an item subject to [former] section 12020, subdivision (a)(1), are to be measured. this may be resolved as a matter of lawe id. at p. 169 & fn. 5, italics added; see in re david v. (2010) 48 cal.4th 23, 2425 [bicycle footrest did not, as a matter of law, fall within the statutory definition of metal knuckles]; people v. mercer, supra, 42 cal.app.4th at p. supp. 46.) people v. canales concluded the trial court in that case did . in canales, the defendant was charged with possession of a blackjack or billy based on his possession of two items: a straight, smooth piece of wood, and a club with nails driven into the large end and covered with tape. (people v. canales, supra, 12 cal.app.2d at p. 217.) the trial court instpurview of the instruments announced id. at p. ccanales reasoned that the trial 10 field or scope of the act, leaving it for the jury to declare whether these particular clubs actually were illegal weapons. it was, however, within the province of the court to determine in the first instance whether they were such weapons as fell within the ibid.) the same was true here. there was no factual dispute stics. (cf. people v. mayberry, supra, as one of the items proscribed by [former] section 12020, subdivision (a)(1), turns on whether the issue may be resolved as a matter of law. definitional issues may turn on the facts. that may arise if the factual characteristics of the item are in dispute].) there was no evidence suggesting the baton was anything other than a bludgeon. the record does not reveal any basis upon which a reasonable jury could have found the baton fe. (see people v. grubb, supra, 63 cal.2d at p. 620, fn. 7 [observing that a 14-inch billy club was the nal use clearly appears from the ].) the trial court therefore did not commit instructional error by telling the jury that a leffler further urges that the trial court prejudicially erred by failing to inform the jury it had to consider the totality of the an assaultive type bludgeoning instrument within the meaning of again, we disagree. in enacting the predecessor to section 22210, the legislature sought to outlaw not only the classic instruments of 11 violence and their homemade equivalentspossession of the sometimes-useful object when the attendant circumstances, including the time, place, destination of the possessor, the alteration of the object from standard form, and other relevant facts indicated that the possessor would use the object for a people v. grubb, supra, 63 cal.2d at pp. 620621, fn. omitted.) circumstances, an ordinary object may constitute a weapon if the baugh, supra, 20 cal.app.5th at p. 445.) possession of an instrument found under suspicious circumstances by proof of his intent to use it in accordance with id. at p. 444, quoting people v. grubb, supra, 63 cal.2d at p. 621, fn. 9.) thus, if the object in question is not a weapon per se, but an instrument with ordinary innocent uses [e.g., a bat or a table leg], the prosecution must prove that the object was possessed as a weaponpeople v. fannin, supra, 91 cal.app.4th at p. 1404; baugh, supra, 20 cal.app.5th at p. 444.) on the other hand, when a defendant is charged with possessing an item with no conceivable innocent people v. fannin, at p. 1405.) in either case, intent to immediately use the item as a weapon is not an element of the offense. (baugh, at pp. 444446; people v. fannin, at p. 1404.) applying these principles here, we discern no basis for reversal. first, leffler did not object to the instructions given or her request any additional instruction informing the jury it should consider the surrounding circumstances. when the trial court 12 responds to a question from a deliberating jury with a generally correct and pertinent statement of the law, a party who believes s response should be modified or clarified must make a contemporaneous request to that effect; failure to object to the s wording or to request clarification results in forfeiture of the claim on appeal. (people v. boyce, supra, 59 cal.4th at p. 699; people v. dykes (2009) 46 cal.4th 731, 802; see generally people v. mora and rangel (2018) 5 cal.5th 442, 471 [failure to object to modification of instruction forfeits claim on appeal]; people v. elder (2017) 11 cal.app.5th 123, 136 [a party may not complain on appeal that an instruction correct in law and responsive to the evidence was too general or incomplete unless the party requested appropriate clarifying or amplifying language].) leffler argues that the trial court precluded defense counsel from objecting, but this is incorrect. when the trial court counsel opined that persons other than peace officers could possess a billy, and the trial court cut sh. however, defense counsel did not discuss or give any indication first question, regarding whether the baton was included within and, choice not to request an additional instruction informing the jury it should consider the surrounding circumstances readily appears. prior to trial, the defense successfully moved to exclude evidence of other items found with the sawed-off shotgun and the baton in the safe: another shotgun, a pistol, a leather gun belt, a camouflage tactical vest, a ski mask, two rubber handgun grips, a digital scale, a set of broken nunchucks, a knife, a sword, and a book 13 the trial court agreed this evidence was excludable pursuant to evidence code section 352, but cautioned that should leffler attempt to portray his possession of the sawed-off shotgun and evidence might become admissible. if leffler had attempted to prove he did not possess the baton as a weapon, this excluded evidence would have been decidedly probativeand highly damningto show otherwise. given that the trial courtexclusion of the evidence effectively prevented the prosecution from fully establishing the relevant circumstances, we decline to here was no evidence supporting an instruction to the jury to consider the surrounding circumstances in this case. the baton was a weapon per se, not an object with an innocent use. therefore the prosecution had no obligation to prove it was possessed as a weapon. (see people v. fannin, supra, 91 cal.app.4th at p. 1405.) or, if the baton had some innocent purpose that was not readily apparent, defendant failed to meet his burden to present any evidence of such an innocent use. (see people v. grubb, supra, demonstrate an innocent usage of the object but the burden falls upon him to do sothere was a dearth of evidence that the baton was useful for any purpose except its typical use as a bludgeon. finally, even assuming the trial court committed instructional error, any assumed error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. (see people v. merritt (2017) 2 cal.5th 819, 14 821822, 826, 831 [failure to instruct on elements of an offense is subject to harmless error analysis under the standard articulated in chapman v. california (1967) 386 u.s. 18]; people v. flood (1998) 18 cal.4th 470, 502503 [instruction that misdescribes or omits an element, raises an improper presumption, or directs a finding or a partial verdict upon a particular element, is generally subject to chapman harmless error review]; people v. vanegas (2004) 115 cal.app.4th 592, 602.) there is no dispute that the collapsible baton could constitute a prohibited item within the meaning of section 22210. collapsible baton as a prohibitpresented no evidence suggesting the item did not qualify as a billy, that is, that it was not a bludgeoning instrument. the baton was found in a safe, along with a sawed-off shotgun, suggesting it was possessed as a weapon. it had no readily apparent innocent use. no evidence whatsoever was introduced to prove leffler possessed the baton for some purpose other than for use as a weapon. to the contrary, his primary defense was that he used the baton during his work as a security guard. was described by [a detective] as a collapsible baton . . . that would be used by somebody who does securityin short, both covery and the nature of the defense suggested that the item was a prohibited billy, and that leffler possessed it as such. given the evidence, it is clear beyond a reasonable doubt the jury would not have rendered a verdict more favorable for leffler had it been instructed to consider the totality of the circumstances, or had the trial court 15 disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports edmon, p. j. we concur: lavin, j. egerton, j.
