(e)(2)(c)(iii), 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(c)(iii). this proposed background the evidence established that on june 29, 2000, defendant borrowed a car from an acquaintance to go out with friends that evening. he did not return it at the agreed-upon time. at about 4:00 a.m. on june 30, a uniformed police officer observed defendant driving the car towards him without any headlights on. although he flashed the high 1 all further section references are to the penal code unless otherwise indicated. 2 reform act of 2012 . . . . proposition 36 reduced the punishment to be imposed with respect to some third strike offenses that are neither serious nor violent, and provided for discretionary resentencing in some cases in which third strike sentences were imposed with respect to felonies that are neither serious people v. johnson (2015) 61 cal.4th 674, 679 (johnson).) proposition 36 was effective on november 7, 2012. (id. at p. 680.) 3 beams of his marked police vehicle several times, defendant did not turn on his lights. defendant then drove his car at 20 to 30 miles per hour through a stop sign. the officer made a u-turn, activated his full rotator lights, and began following defendant, who was then proceeding at about 50 miles per hour. although the officer turned on his siren, defendant drove through several more stop signs at about 70 miles per hour on the residential streets. defendant drove onto the 210 freeway, exited at the next off-ramp, and immediately went up the on-p of the ramp, defendant slowed down his car and jumped hillside opposite. two other men were in the car. another officer and a k-9 unit found defendant hiding under the bushes. although he had been observed wearing a hat, shirt and shoes as he exited the car and ran across the freeway, he was not wearing those items at the time of his arrest. the lender of the car told police that on recent occasions she had seen defendant carrying a revolver. shortly afterward, police officers searched the hillside where defendant had been hiding and recovered a loaded .22-caliber revolver, which had been covered by leaves. near the gun they also found a shoe, a hat, and a shirt. no defense evidence was presented. defense counsel argued the evidence did not establish either that defendant was the driver or that he possessed the gun. the jury convicted defendant of evading a peace officer with willful or wanton disregard for safety (veh. code,  2800.2, subd. (a)); possession of a firearm by a felon (former  12021, subd. (a)(1) [now  29800, subd. (a)(1), as amended by stats. 2010, ch. 711,  6]); and carrying a loaded firearm not registered to him (former  12031, subd. (a)(2(f) [now  25850, subd. (c)(6), as amended by stats. 2011, ch. 15,  544]). the trial court found he had sustained two prior serious felony convictions within the meaning of the three strikes law ( 667, subds. (b)-(i), 1170.12, subds. (a)-(d)) and had served a 4 prior prison term ( 667.5, subd. (b)). he was sentenced to prison for 25 years to life. this court affirmed the judgment from which he appealed.3 on may 17, 2013, defendant filed a petition to recall his sentence and for resentencing on each of his felony convictions in counts 1 through 3. on june 14, 2013, the proposition 36 court issued an order to show cause why the petition should not be granted. the people filed opposition and supplemental opposition. defendant filed a reply. on february 1, 2016, at the hearing on the petition, the proposition 36 court recited the evidence as showing that while defendant was in the car he was dressed but when he was found hiding in some bushes across the freeway, he was not. his hat, shirt, and a handgun, which was a revolver, were found near where he had been hiding. the friend who loaned him the car reported she had seen defendant with a gun previously. eight hours that, although his shoes were found at the time of arrest, the gun was found eight hours later on the hillside. the court asked, where he had hid , yctly where, butthe gun and the fact he exited the car with the gun would show that he was armed with defense counsel objected that ]he s 3 the above background is taken from the earlier unpublished opinion (b146467), of which we take judicial notice. (evid. code,  452, subd. (d)(1), 459.) 5 for recall and resentencing because he was armed with a firearm during the commission discussion 1. was legally sound and supported by substantial evidence defendant contends the trial court erred in finding he was armed with a firearm during the commission of the current three offenses. we disagree.

(people v. dove (2004) 124 cal.app.4th 1, 10; people v. johnson (2003) 114 cal.app.4th 284, 290.) under the applicable review standard, we examine the evidence, both direct and circumstantial, in light of the entire record and must indulge in favor of the order all presumptions as well as every logical inference that the court could have drawn from the evidence. (people v. maury (2003) 30 cal.4th 342, 396; people v. carter (2005) 36 cal.4th 1114, 1156; people v. ochoa (1993) 6 cal.4th 1199, 1206.) the [s] any express or implied factual findings of the court that are (people v. robinson (2010) 47 cal4th 1104, 1126.) based on our review of the record, which includes relevant portions of the reported transcript of the trial, we conclude substantial evidence supports the express and implied factual findings of the proposition 36 court in ruling defendant was armed with a firearm during the commission of the current offenses. the court expressly found that the black revolver found under covered leaves near the spot on the hillside where 6 defendant hid from the officers was the same gun the lender of the car had seen in defendantabout the day of the incident. at trial, the testimony of the lender established that on a couple of occasions she had seen defendant with a gun. the first time was a couple of weeks prior to this incident when he held the gun in his hand as they were travelling in her car. she had loaned her car to defendant in the past. the second time was on or about the same day as the incident. she described the gun as black and looking old with a cylinder that spins, i.e., a revolver. the revolver recovered from the hillside near the shoes the gun during the commission of the current offenses. this finding is supported by the reasonable inference defendant necessarily had the gun with him when the officer first flashed his high beams and throughout the incident, because after exiting his car, defendant fled across the freeway and hid in the bushes where the police found concealed nearby his discarded clothing, shoes, and gun. 2. crequirement does not necessitate facilitative nexus  667, subd.
