(people v. wende (1979) 25 cal.3d 436 (wende).) defendant filed a supplemental brief1 with this court, raising a number of issues, such as the sufficiency of the health, ineffective assistance of counsel, and the prejudicial impact of late discovery. defendant has not raised any arguable appellate issues. his claims of error are not supported by any legal analysis. requ (people v. murray (2008) 167 cal.app.4th 1133, 1143.) authority forfeits these issues on appeal. (people v. hovarter (2008) 44 cal.4th 983, 1029; people v. meyer (1963) 216 cal.app.2d 618, 635.) 1 with defendant, who is illiterate. 4 assertions in his supplemental brief, we have examined the entire record, and are satisfied that no arguable issues exist. (people v. kelly (2006) 40 cal.4th 106; wende, supra 25 cal.3d 436.) there was ample evidence in support of conviction. (people v. diaz (1992) 3 cal.4th 495, 541; people v. palma (1995) 40 cal.app.4th 1559, 1567.) moreover, we can discern no ineffective assistance of counsel on the record before us. (people v. mitchell (2008) 164 cal.app.4th 442, 467; see also people v. mendoza tello (1997) 15 cal.4th 264, 266-267.) untimely discovery, we can discern no prejudice, because defendant received an instruction about late discovery. (people v. verdugo (2010) 50 cal.4th 263, 279-280.) further, defendant never requested an instruction concerning his mental state, and there was absolutely no evidence that his mental health played any part in this crime. (people v. saille (1991) 54 cal.3d 1103, 1118-1119 [the court has no sua sponte duty to instruct on mental impairment as a defense to specific intent or mental state].) we therefore affirm the judgment below. disposition the judgment is affirmed. grimes, j. we concur: rubin, acting p. j. flier, j.
