5:30 p.m. on january 25, 2018, daxaben ahir and her nephew priyank ahir were working at a motel in los angeles. preparing to leave, daxaben started her lexus suv and left it running, with the key inside, as she re-entered the motel to get change. priyank then saw a man walk toward the car. priyank quickly exited the motel, only to see the car speeding away. the man he had seen was gone. approximately 24 hours later, torrance police department officer keith crofton stolen car, which had been identified by a license plate reader. appellant, who was driving the car, made several turns and then parked in a grocery store parking lot, where officer crofton parked behind the car, blocking it. the officer then activated the flashing overhead lights on his vehicle, which was marked as belonging to the torrance police department. 5 unbidden, appellant exited the stolen car. officer crofton, wearing his patrol uniform and partially emerging from his own vehicle, ordered appellant to re-enter the car. instead, appellant took several steps toward the officer. drawing his gun, officer crofton ordered appellant to get on the ground. appellant ran away. remaining with the stolen car, officer crofton reported the direction in which appellant had run. other officers arrested appellant nearby and found a discarded flannel shirt, which officer crofton identified as app the officers found a useable quantity of methamphetamine in b. defense case appellant presented no evidence in his defense. c. jury instructions without objection, the trial court granted the vehicle from the jury instruction on the elements of the section 10851 charge (calcrim no. 1820).2 the court instructed the jury that the prosecution was required to prove the following two elements: 2 the prosecutor explained the purpose of this request was intent (calcrim no. 252) and possession of recently stolen property as evidence of a crime (calcrim no. 376). 6 someowner of possession or ownership of the vehicle for any the court delivered several instructions on burdens of proof, includinproof beyond a reasonable doubt (calcrim no. 220), to refrain from testifying or producing evidence (calcrim no. 355). it further instructed the jury on evaluating the sufficiency of circumstantial evidence (calcrim no. 224), instructing it, you must accept only reasonable conclusions and reject any that are the court instructed the jury that it could infer hide evidence (calcrim no. 371) or if it found he had fled immediately after the crime (calcrim no. 372).3 it further instructed the jury that neither finding would be sufficient to prove guilt. 3 the trial court overruled objection to the flight instruction. 7 d. closing arguments 1. the prosecutor argued that appellant fled from officer crofton because he was conscious of his guilt of driving a stolen car. he argued that appellant further demonstrated consciousness of guilt by attempting to hide evidence that could identify him as the driver, viz., his flannel shirt. he then suggested that the jury should find appellant knew the car was stolen because, as evidenced by his possession of the car only 24 hours after its theft, appellant stole the car himself. however, he reminded the jury that the prosecution was not required to prove appellant stole the car, and that the case was about driving the car, rather than taking it. he argued that discarding of the shirt also showed appellant knew the car was stolen. 2. defense closing argument that appellant might have run from officer crofton because he had methamphetamine in his pocket, urging the jury to reject an inference that he ran because he knew the car was stolen.4 she also urged the jury to reject an inference that appellant was trying to hide evidence when he discarded his flannel shirt, arguing that he instead discarded it because he got hot while running. she argued that if he had known the car was stolen, he would have tried to evade officer crofton before parking the 4 the charges of possession of methamphetamine and resisting or obstructing a peace officer. 8 car. 24 hours after its theft was insufficient to prove he stole it himself, and that no other evidence established his knowledge that it was stolen. 3. in rebuttal, the prosecutor again reminded the jury that the state had not charged appellant with stealing the car, clarifying that he had suggested appellant stole the car only to support a finding that appellant knew the car was stolen at the time he was driving it. responding to the defense theory that appellant did not know the car was stolen, the prosecutor observed that appellant was in possession of the car within a day of its theft, and that one remarked, and sometimes evidence is actually the absence of evidence. . . . maybe he purchased the car. where is the a the grounds that the prosecutor was shifting the burden of proof and arguing matters beyond the scope of proper rebuttal. the court cautious about that kind of argument. during a sidebar, the court clarified that it was cautioning the prosecutor not to call attention to the absence of testimony from appellant himself. the court then reminded the jury that it had been instructed not , and stated the prosecutor was not arguing for such consideration. 9 s that appellant knew the car was stolen, but acknowledged the jury might think of other possible, albeit not reasonable, scenarios. he pointed out the absence of any purchase record supporting the possibility that someone sold the car to appellant, as wefailure to call any witness claiming to have loaned the car to him. the prosecutor assertedagain noting the absence of e told the jury that 5 the prosecutor acknowledged that his theory that appellant knew the car was stolen relied on circumstantial evidence, viz., the short time between the theft and his discarding of the shirt. the prosecutor then paraphrased calcrim no. 224, reminding the jury that the law required it to reject unreasonable conclusions, and accept only reasonable ones, when evaluating circumstantial evidence. in concluding, he stated, anunopposed. the facts are unopposed. there is only one 5 fol-objection, noting the defense had options to compel witnesses to testify. 10 reasonable conclusion based on this evidence and that is that e. jury question and response during its deliberations, the jury submitted the following question (quoting from calcrim no. 1820, as modified): we only consider the true owner of the vehicle or is it fair to question that the defendant may have believed the car was owned by someone else who gave him permission to drive the the prosecutor argued that the question showed the jury was impermissibly considering facts not in evidence, and asked the court to instruct the jury to base its decision on the evidence rather than speculation. s request and submitted the following response to the jury: evaluating the evidence in this case, you may consider the deciding paragraph 2 of instruction 1820. for paragraph 1, the paragraphs referenced by the court read as follows: the defendant drove someone the defendant did so, he intended to deprive the owner of possession or ownership of the vehicle for any period of 11 discussion appellant contends (1) the prosecutor engaged in prejudicial misconduct by (a) committing griffin error, and trial court prejudicially erred by instructing the jury on flight as evidence of consciousness of guilt; and (3) the absurd consequences doctrine and equal protection doctrine require application of proposition 47 to his driving-based section 10851 conviction, rendering his conviction for a felony unsound due to the absence of evidence of the stolen a. vehicle code section 10851 ]ny person who drives or takes a vehicle not his or her own, without the consent of the owner thereof, and with intent either to permanently or temporarily deprive the owner thereof of his or her title to or possession of the

(a)can be violated by a range of conduct, only some of which lara, supra, 6 cal.5th 1128, 1135.) as most relevant here, it can be violated by posttheft driving, consent after the vehicle has been stolen, with the intent to temporarily or permanently deprive the owner of title or id. at p. 1136, quoting people v. page (2017) 3 cal.5th 1175, 1188 (page)where the evidence shows a 12 substantial break between the taking and the driving, posttheft driving may give rise to a conviction under vehicle code section 10851 distinct from any liability for vehicle theft.6 (lara, supra, at p. 1136, quoting page, supra, at p. 1188.) such a conviction is distinct from a theft conviction even if the convicted posttheft driver also stole the vehicle. (see lara, supra, at p. 1137 [evidence amply supported posttheft driving conviction, regardless of whether defendant was involved in the theft]; page, supra, at p. 1189 [defendant cannot prove section 10851 conviction was based on theft rather than posttheft driving merely by declaring or testifying that he stole the vehicle].) 6 here, as in laraincomplete: while the instruction specified driving as the alleged lara, supra, 6 cal.5th at p. 1138; see also id. at p. 1132 [instruction consent and with intent to deprive owner of possession or ownership].) however, again as in lara, it is clear beyond a reasonable doubt that a rational jury would have rendered the same verdict had it received a complete instruction. (id. at p. 1138.) the prosecutor reminded the jury both in his initial argument and in rebuttal that appellant was not charged with taking or stealing the car. although the prosecutor suggested appellant had stolen the car (relying solely on his possession of the car the next day), the prosecutor clarified that this argument was relevant only to a finding that appellant had the requisite intent when driving the car roughly 24 hours later. neither the prosecutor nor the trial court suggested the jury could base a conviction on a finding that appellant drove the car during the theft, rather than after the substantial, 24-hour break. 13 generally, a punishable as either a felony or a misdemeanor.

(people v. gonzalez (2018) 5 cal.5th 186, 195-196.) 2. governing principles the rule established in griffin, supra, 380 u.s. 609, prohibits a prosecutor from commenting failure to testify. (people v. thomas (2012) 54 cal.4th 908, 945 (thomas).) if he or she argues to the jury that certain testimony or evidence is uncontradicted, [and] if such contradiction or denial could be provided only [citation.] (ibid.) similarly, under the griffin rule, a 15 prosecutor refer to the absence of evidence that only people v. brady (2010) 50 cal.4th 547, 565-566 (brady).) however, the rule does not otherwise forbid comment on the absence of defense evidence.

(id. at p. 831.) our sunderstood it, in its context, as erroneously implying a defense 19 absence of evidence is not evidence.

(id. at pp. 831-832.) here, the prosecutor made no such statement. 9 the cases on which respondent relies are inapposite with comments characterizing the absence of defense evidence as prosecution evidence. (see people v. young (2005) 34 cal.4th 1149, 1195-1196 [prosecutor permissibly commented on absence of any evidence that might have supported reasonable interpretation other than that defendant killed victim]; people v. boyette (2002) 29 cal.4th 381, 434 testimony by pointing out absence of corroborating evidence]; people v. bradford (1997) 15 cal.4th 1229, 1339-1340 [prosecutor permissibly commented on absence of evidence contradicting prosecution evidence].) 20 terroneous comments, however, were not prejudicial. they were made only in passing and were unaccompanied by any other form of error. further, we cannot lightly infer the jury relied on the absence of defense evidence to compensate for shortcomings in the prosecution case, where the prosecution case had no serious shortcomings. the only disputed issue was whether the car. supported by evidence of crofton and his discarding of his shirt, reasonably viewed as an attempt to avoid identification as the driver), as well as evidence that only 24 hours had passed between the theft of the car and the discovery of appellant driving it (rendering it less likely that appellant obtained permission from a putative owner). there was ample evidence to satisfy the properly instructed the jury. appellant has not rebutted the 10 10 question to argument that the jury was thereby departing from instructions, and submitted a response to the jury informing it that in evaluating the intent element of the section 10851 does not 21 (see people v. bennett (2009) 45 cal.4th 577, 596 [rejecting contention that prosecutor prejudicially shifted burden of proof to defendant by asking witnesses about availability of dna evidence for retesting, in part due to presumption that n of proof].) although the prosecutor should not have characterized the absence of defense evidence as prosecution evidence, it is not reasonably probable the verdict would have been more favorable to appellant in the absence of this comment.11 in sum, mospermissible, and the few that were erroneous were not prejudicial. c. flight instruction appellant argues the trial court prejudicially erred by instructing the jury with calcrim no. 372, the standard flight instruction. demonstrated it was confused about the burden of proof. 11 on the issue of prejudice, too, the cases on which appellant relies are distinguishable. (see centeno, supra, 60 cal.4th at pp. 669-674 [prosecutor not only strongly implied that required only reasonable account of evidence, but also illustrated burden with visual aid and hypothetical oversimplifying and trivializing deliberative process]; hill, supra, 17 cal.4th at pp. 845-847 [finding prejudice 22 1. standard of review novo. (people v. rivera (2019) 7 cal.5th 306, 326.) error in delivering a flight instruction not warranted by the evidence is reviewed for prejudice under the watson standard. (see people v. turner (1990) 50 cal.3d 668, 694-695 (turner); people v. crandell (1988) 46 cal.3d 833, 870 (crandell), abrogated on another ground by people v. crayton (2002) 28 cal.4th 346, 364-365.) 2. governing principles where the prosecution relies on evidence from which a reasonable jury could find flight reflecting consciousness of guilt, the trial court is statutorily required to give a standard flight instruction. (see people v. howard (2008) 42 cal.4th 1000, 1020; people v. price (2017) 8 cal.app.5th 409, 454-455 (price) [calcrim no. 372 is consistent with the statutory requirement].)12 the prosecution must rely on evidence that the defendant left the crime scene in circumstances (people v. bonilla (2007) 41 cal.4th 313, 328 (bonilla), quoting crandell, supra, 46 cal.3d at p. 12 the standard flight instruction does not create an unconstitutional permissive inference of guilt. (see price, supra, 8 cal.app.5th at pp. 455-rather than whether the defendant committed the alleged acts. (people v. smithey (1999) 20 cal.4th 936, 983.) 23 instruction, the prosecution need not prove the defendant in fact fled, i.e., departed the scene to avoid arrest, only that a jury could find the defendant fled and permissibly infer a bonilla, supra, at p. 328.) 3. analysis the trial court did not err in giving the standard flight instruction because there was substantial evidence of flight from which the jury could infer consciousness of guilt. the jury reasonably could have found appellant feared officer crofton would arrest him, that he blocked appellant with his marked police vehicle, turned on his overhead lights, and ordered appellant to get on the ground. well further, the appellant ran from him and discarded the shirt he had been wearing, and to infer from his conduct that appellant was attempting to reduce the likelihood other officers would on the basis of this evidence, the jury reasonably could have found appellantrunning away was to avoid being arrested. that possibility warranted the instruction, regardless of whether the jury could have found, as appellant argues, that he ran away because he was afraid the officer would shoot him. (see bonilla, supra, 41 cal.4th at p. 328.) 24 even had we found error in giving the flight instruction, we would find no prejudice. contrary to to draw,the instruction required the jury neither to infer consciousness of guilt from flight nor to find flight in the first instance.13 (see crandell, supra, 46 cal.3d at p. 870 [erroneous flight instruction not prejudicial in part because it left dete moreover, the court instructed the jury consciousness of guilt: an attempt to hide evidence. the prosecutor argued that appellant demonstrated consciousness of guilt not only by fleeing, but also by attempting to hide evidence by discarding his flannel shirt. (see crandell, supra, at p. 870 [erroneous flight instruction not prejudicial in part because defendant manifested consciousness of guilt through conduct other than flight].) finally, although the prosecutor relied on the evidence of 13 indeed, the instruction cautioned the jury that even if it found flight, it could not infer guilt from flight alone. our supreme court has recognized that the cautionary aspect of the standard flight instruction may benefit the defense. (people v. streeter (2012) 54 cal.4th 205, 254 benefitted evidence that might otherwise be considered decisively people v. jackson (1996) 13 cal.4th 1164, 1224.) 25 the temporal proximity discovery of appellant driving it. in sum, there is no reasonable probability the verdict would have been more favorable to appellant had the trial court not delivered the flight instruction. (see turner, supra, 50 cal.3d at pp. 694-695; crandell, supra, at p. 870.) d. application of proposition 47 appellant contends we must interpret proposition 47 to apply not only to those section 10851 convictions based on theft but also to those, like his, based on posttheft driving, arguing that to interpret it otherwise would result in (1) absurd consequences, and (2) an equal protection violation. relying on the premise that proposition 47 applies to his conviction, he further argues that he was improperly convicted of a felony because the prosecution failed to prove the . 1. standard of review issues concerning the interpretation of proposition 47 are subject to de novo review. (see people v. gonzales (2018) t initiative is governed by the same principles that apply in construing a ibid.) constitutional challenge to an interpretation of proposition 47 is likewise subject to de novo review. (people v. superior 26 court (j.c. penney corp., inc.) (2019) 34 cal.app.5th 376, 387.) 2. governing principles wisdom, expediency, or policy of the act, even if it appears probable that a different object was in the mind of the in re d.b. (2014) 58 cal.4th 941, 948.) even our supreme court will not rewrite a statute simply because its plain language, interpreted literally, yields results that ibid.) we may not depart from the literal interpretation of a clearly worded statute unless the results of that interpretation are so unreasonable that the lawmakers could not have intended them. (ibid.) both the state and federal constitutions extend to persons the equal protection of law. (people v. chatman (2018) 4 cal.5th 277, 287.) neither draws a suspect classification nor burdens fundamental rights, . . . [w]e find a denial of equal protection only if there is no rational relationship between a disparity 14 14 appellant does not claim that the challenged classification here involves a suspect class. although he argues the classification burdens his fundamental right to liberty, relying on people v. olivas (1976) 17 cal.3d 236, our supreme court has declined to read that case so broadly, reasoning that a criminal 27 (id. at pp. 288-a classification affecting two or more groups that are id. at p. 289.) we deem the groups at issue similarly situated in all material respects, we consider whether the challenged classification ultimately bears a rational relationship to a leibid.) the challenger bears the ibid.) to be rational and reasonably conceivable, the basis for the law need not be empirically substantiated, persuasive, or sensible; nor need it have been articulated by the lawmakers.

[holding rational basis test scheme allowing more severe punishment for battery on custodial officer without injury than for such battery with injury].) we challenge requires strict scrutiny rather than rational basis review. 28 3. analysis posttheft driving conviction violates neither the absurd consequences doctrine of statutory interpretation nor the constitutional guarantee to equal protection, despite the fact that proposition 47 would have precluded a felony conviction on a theft theory (due to the $950). the plain language of proposition 47 allows prosecutors to seek greater punishment for posttheft driving of a low-value car than for theft of the same car.15 (lara, supra, 6 caa violation committed by posttheft driving may be charged and sentenced as a felony this is not an absurd result, because defendants convicted of posttheft driving may have committed more culpable acts than defendants convicted of vehicle theft. for the same reason, the voters had a rational 15 in page, our supreme court declined to consider whether either the absurd consequences doctrine or equal protection for taking a vehicle without the intent to permanently deprive the (page, supra, 3 cal.5th at p. 1188, fn. 5.) the court has since granted review of that question in another case. (people v. bullard (feb. 21, 2018, no. s239488) 2018 cal. lexis 1032, at *1.) recently, the court noted that the question left open in page concerns the application of proposition 47 to because the facts before it concerned a conviction on a posttheft driving theory rather than a joyriding theory. (see lara, supra, 6 cal.5th at pp. 1136-1138 & fn. 3.) 29 discretion. for instance, a posttheft driver may have led law enforcement officers on a dangerous and resource-intensive pursuit. (cf. people v. morales (2019) 33 cal.app.5th 800, 807 (morales) [finding no absurdity in potential for more severe punishment of posttheft driving than for theft, in part riving is an inherently dangerous activity, driving illegally even more so, and although the theft of a car permission may be done many times, multiplying the threat ].) alternatively, a posttheft driver may have used a stolen car to facilitate another crime (e.g., disposing of a body or selling stolen people v. van orden (2017) 9 cal.app.5th 1277, 1286, review dismissed march 14, 2018, s241574 bonnie and clyde, who committed posttheft driving for purpose of crime spree, with gone in 60 seconds, who stole cars for sole purpose of saving brother].) theoretically, a posttheft driver familiar with car thieves or with their dumping grounds could repeatedly use stolen cars for other crimes without ever stealing a car himself. (cf. lara, supra, 6 cal.5th at p. 1131 [recounting fact that defendant drove stolen car one day after police had found it parked at area 30 we need not assume defendants convicted of posttheft driving always have committed more culpable acts than those convicted of vehicle theft. indeed, defendants convicted on a posttheft driving theory may also have committed the theft themselves. (see lara, supra, 6 cal.5th at p. 1137; page, supra, 3 cal.5th at p. 1189.) but it is sufficient that posttheft driving convictions may sometimes be based on more culpable acts. (see wilkinson, supra, 33 cal.4th at p. 839 [inferring legislature rationally contemplated that the ostensible lesser offense of battery without injury sometimes may constitute a more serious offense and merit greater punishment than the greater offense of battery accompanied by injury].) moreover, the potential for disparate punishment unrelated to the culpability of the offenses can be avoided through prosecutorial discretion in electing to charge posttheft driving as a misdemeanor. (see wilkinson, supra, 33 cal.4th at p. 838 [finding rational basis in part because legislature reasonably could withhold from trial courts discretion to reduce felonies to misdemeanors in cases in re d.b., supra, 58 cal.4th at pp. 947-948 [no absurdity resulted from interpreting statute to condition particular form of commitment only on most recently committed offense, even though interpretation could potentially reward minor for committing more crimes, in part because that charging and dismissal decisions].) in enacting proposition 31 47, the voters rationally could have intended to limit its categorical elimination of felony-charging discretion to those section 10851 cases in which the prosecution could prove theft of a vehicle but could not also prove posttheft driving (or value in excess of $950). in sum, the challenged distinction between posttheft driving and theft convictions is neither absurd nor unsupported by a rational basis.16 disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the offical reports manella, p. j. we concur: collins, j. currey, j. 16 we do not reach the question whether defendants convicted of driving a stolen vehicle under section 10851 are similarly situated to those convicted of vehicle theft. at least one court has held they are not, and has rejected an equal protection challenge on that ground without reaching the question of a rational basis for the sentencing disparity. (people v. morales, supra, 33 cal.app.5th at pp. 808-809.)
