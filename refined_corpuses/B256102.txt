(a)), a felony,1 and was placed on probation and drug treatment under proposition 36 (pen. code,  1210.1). we affirm. factual and procedural background a. testimony at the suppression hearing witnesses testified to the following facts at the suppression hearing held on april 29, 2014: 1. the traffic stop los angeles police officer matthew mauldin and his partner were part of an undercover narcotics team working in the san fernando valley on the evening of june 30, 2013. they suspected individuals whom they watched entering and leaving a 1 on november 4, 2014, the voters approved proposition 47, which amended health and safety code section 11377, subdivision (a), effective november 5, 2014. proposition 47 provides, with certain exceptions, that the crime of possession of a controlled substance is a misdemeanor, not a felony. proposition 47 also added penal code section 1170.18, which authorizes specified persons previously convicted of a felony possession charge to petition for recall of the sentence and resentencing. the question of what effect, if any, is not before us in this appeal. 3 house over a period of time were purchasing illegal drugs at the residence. the officers also noticed a woman pacing in the driveway and talking on her cell phone. the woman stopped pacing when steffin pulled up in his car. the woman got into the front passenger seat with steffin, and they drove off. mauldin and his partner followed steffin. at that time, mauldin and his partner used a cell phone to call officer jose gonzalez, who was part of the undercover narcotics team, to assist in following steffin. mauldin observed steffin making an unsafe lane change without using his signal, in violation of the vehicle code. steffin then entered a motel parking lot and stopped. mauldin pulled into the parking lot gonzalez also drove into the parking lot. all three officers exited their vehicles and mauldin and where steffin was seated. mauldin identified himself by showing his police badge, and steffin moved his right hand towards the center console of the vehicle, then mauldin believed the object could be a weapon or drugs, and asked steffin to get out of the car. steffin complied, and gonzalez conducted a patdown. 2. the patdown of steffin after steffin stepped out of the car, gonzalez when gonzalez ide, he methamphetamine. gonzalez -when he was performing the patdown, gonzalez touched only the outside of gonzalez testified that, in performing the pat down, method he had learned at the police academy. gonzalez explained: started on the right-hand side of his body, and i began to do a spider crawl on his shoulders down to his arm, and then i began doing the waist in the front and then the front pockets . . . [a]nd on cross examination, gonzalez testified as follows: 4 . . . how did the object feel as you were doing this spider crawl down his leg? i felt a small bindle with a granular texture. did you squeeze it? when i do a spider crawl, i technically do squeeze. yes. so as you reached his pocket, you squeezed his pocket and you felt a granular bindle, as you said? a correct. so youthis was not really a pat-down. you were not tapping his body. you were doing a spider crawl where you were squeezing; correct? yeah, in the police academy, we were trained to do spider- once gonzalez felt the object and recognized that it was methamphetamine, he with an off-white, gonzalez also recovered a cell phone and a wallet from inside pocket. when gonzalez finished his patdown, mauldin looked in the vehicle and observed a cell phone inside. b. argument and the cruling steffin did not testify at the suppression hearing. following the presentation of evidence, steffinmethamphetamine should be suppressed because the manner in which gonzalez conducted the patdown exceeded the permissible scope of a terry search.2 the trial court denied the suppression motion, concluding that the officers acted reasonably in conducting a terry patdown for a weapon for their own safety. the court noted that gonzalez did not need to perform much squeezing or manipulating to 2 not sufficient cause for the patdown, but steffin does not make this argument on appeal. 5 determine that the object was methamphetamine, and held that under these circumstances, to search for a weapon. discussion a. standard of review in reviewing a trial courts ruling on a motion to suppress evidence, we defer to that courts factual findings, express or implied, if they are supported by substantial evidence. [citation.] we exercise our independent judgment in determining whether, on the facts presented, the search or seizure was reasonable under the fourth amendment.

(adams v. williams (1972) 407 u.s. 143, 146 [92 s.ct. 1921, 32 l.ed.2d 612].) 3 whether evidence should be suppressed because it was unlawfully seized is governed by federal constitutional standards. (cal. const., art. i,  28, subd. (f)(2); robey v. superior court, supra, 56 cal.4th at p. 1223.) 6 if during a lawful patdown under terry an officer discovers contraband, the officer may seize it. (dickerson, supra, 508 u.s. at pp. 370-371, 373.) this has been described as the plain-touchplain-feel(see id. at p. 371, fn. 1; in re lennies h.

(ibid.) other courts have similarly held that once an officer determines that an object discovered in a patdown is not a weapon, the officer cannot squeeze, manipulate, or palpate the object without probable cause for a further search. (see people v. limon (1993) 17 cal.app.4th 524, 536 [once officer believes a concealed object is not a weapon, the officer cannot continue to palpate the object without probable cause to ; united states v. miles (9th cir. 2001) 247 f.3d 1009, 1014-1015 where officer .) this case presents facts more similar to those considered by the fifth district in people v. dibb, supra, 37 cal.app.4th at pp. 836-837, where the court found seizure of of the circumstances that a lump the officer felt was narcotics, and by the first district in people v. lee grabbing or claw-type of motion8 and there was no appreciable lapse of timwas a bundle of heroin-filled balloons. (see also in re lennies h., supra, 126 cal.app.4th at p. 1238 -ed probable cause that keys were contraband]; united states v. mattarolo (9th cir. 2000) 209 f.3d 1153, 1156, 1158 [where officer believed small controlled substance].) we now turn to the facts in this case. c. the trial court properly denied the motion to suppress based on officer gonzalezupon feeling the small grainy-textured object in pocket, the time it took gonzalez to conclude the object was a bindle of methamphetamine not we defer to this factual finding by the trial court as supported by substantial evidence under the deferential standard of review. (robey v. superior court , supra, 56 cal.4th at p. 1223.) as gonzalez testified, object. he also described the time it took him to recognize that the object was methamphetamine as steffin contends that we must still find the search unlawful under dickerson, because gonzalez discovered the bindle by squeezing his clothing using the spider crawl search method, which exceeded the scope of a terry patdown. however, the facts here are distinguishable from those in dickerson because, according to gonzalez, he atdown on steffin with the explicit purpose of searching for weapons. this was reasonable in light of the evidence that once mauldin identified himself as a police officer, steffin moved his arm and something black fell between his legs. by contrast, a critical factor in dickerson was that the officer had determined that 9 the object did the officer conclude that it was cocaine. (dickerson, supra, 508 u.s. at p. 378.) unlawful under terry. rather, the critical factor, as in dickerson, is whether the officer is performing the patdownwhether by squeezing or pattingfor the purpose of determining whether the suspect has a weapon. once the officer has determined that the suspect does not have a weapon, then the patdown must end. at this point it would no longer be lawful to squeeze an item determined not to be a weapon in order to determine whether it is narcotics. as part of the patdown, gonzalez felt the granular bag of methamphetamine by a squeeze, but he did not have to manipulate the bag further before identifying it as a his conclusion that the object was was once gonzalez reached the conclusion that the object (dickerson, supra, 508 u.s. at pp. 375-376; in re lennies h., supra, 126 cal.app.4th at p. 1237.) the motion to suppress was properly denied. 10 disposition the judgment is affirmed. feuer, j.* we concur: perluss, p. j. zelon, j. * judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
