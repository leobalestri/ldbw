(a)), and (2) possession of marijuana for sale (id.,  11359).2 defendant requested counsel, and was appointed an attorney from the office of the alternate public defender. by that time, that attorney (counsel) had been working for 17 years in criminal defense and 13 years with the office. in april 2013, counsel spoke with the prosecutor and negotiated a tentative plea deal. pursuant to that deal, defendant would plead guilty to a single count of transporting marijuana and be sentenced to three years of formal probation and 180 days in jail; in exchange, the people would dismiss the remaining count against him. counsel asked to continue the matter so that defendant could consult with an immigration attorney. defendant and counsel met again before the continued hearing in may 2013. at that time, counsel reviewed with defendant the felony advisements of rights, waiver and plea form (felony plea form or form). among other advisements, the form united states, i must expect my plea of guilty or no contest will result in my deportation, exclusion from admission or reentry into the united states, and denial of naturalization and endant placed his initials next to that advisement. during the plea colloquy, the trial court asked defendant 2 the people charged the passenger with (1) possession of a controlled substance (id.,  11350, subd. (a)), and (2) possession of a controlled substance with a firearm (id.,  11370.1, subd. (a)). 4 united states, by pleading guilty you will be deported, you will be denied naturalization and you will be excluded from admission to the united plea to the transportation of marijuana count. in june 2013, the court sentenced defendant to three years of formal probation, including 180 days of jail. d. immigration proceedings the federal immigration authorities initiated removal proceedings against defendant in july 2013. the petition alleged that his transportation of marijuana conviction rendered him subject to removal because it was an aggravated felony (under 8 u.s.c.  1227(a)(2)(a)(iii)) and a controlled substance offense (under 8 u.s.c.  1227(a)(2)(b)(i)). the immigration judge ruled that defendant was subject to removal for having sustained a controlled substance offense and was ineligible for discretionary relief because he committed the instant offense within seven years of becoming a lawful permanent resident. defendant appealed the ruling, and was released from custody while the appeal was pending. while he was released, he married his u.s. citizen-girlfriend and had two children with her. on january 30, 2018. ii. procedural background a. defe in may 2018, defendant filed a motion to vacate his 2013 conviction under section 1473.7. he argued that he was entitled 5 guilty was constitutionally deficient in two ways: (1) counsel gave him incorrect advice about the immigration consequences of his plea, and (2) counsel did not try to negotiate a plea that would have no immigration consequences. in support of his motion, defendant filed two declarations from himself and a declaration from his wife along with several court documents. the people filed an opposition, and defendant filed a reply. b. hearing on june 27, 2018, the trial court held a hearing on called two witnesseshis wife and counsel. (defendant himself was not present because he had been deported.) all of the meetings defendant had with counsel prior to his plea, and that counsel had told defendant that (1) pleading to the defendant himself to speak with an immigration lawyer, and (3) what it said). on cross-examination, she admitted that she was unable to remember the judge or the prosecutor from her every single word that [counsel] told [defendant] when it came to counsel testified that he had no independent recollection of this case, but he brought his case file. the file contained his 6 count 1 [the transportation count] / 180 [days county jail] . . . put [i]nformed informed of rights, obligations, 2013, which indicated that transportation of marijuana was a deportable controlled substance offense. based on these notes and his consistent practice in dealing with all clients, counsel testified that he spoke with defendant about his immigration status, reviewed the plea waiver form verbatim, including the and asked that the court proceedings be continued so defendant could discuss the immigration consequences of his plea with an immigration attorney. counsel explained that his notation that can used to explain the immigration consequences to defendant. (italics added.) counsel further explained that he would never have told a client not to consult an immigration attorney, would never tell a client that the advisements in a plea waiver form that is not a term he uses and because in 2013 he did not know any lawyers who practiced immigration law. c. ruling the trial court denied the motion. wife not to be credible. specifically, the court found that counsel 7 tell a client to ignore the language in a plea waiver form, to say consult an immigration expert. based in part on that finding, the court concluded that specifically, the court ruled that counsel had given defendant counsel read to defendant. the court also ruled that counsel mere transportation. d. appeal defendant timely appealed the denial of his motion. discussion defendant argues that the trial court erred in denying his section 1473.7 motion.3 among other things, that section empowers a trial court to vacate a conv. . . the actual or potential adverse immigration consequences of a to his decision to enter the plea. ( 1473.7, subd. (a)(1); people v. 3 defendant also argues that the trial court erred in refusing, on hearsay grounds, to consider his declaration. because the court made an alternative ruling obviates any need to reach this evidentiary challenge. 8 camacho (2019) 32 cal.app.5th 998, 1011-1012, (camacho).) as the moving party, the defendant bears the burden of making this showing by a preponderance of the evidence. ( 1473.7, subd. (e)(1); camacho, at p. 1005.) a showing that defense counsel at the time of the plea was constitutionally ineffective will suffice, invalidity may, but need not, include a finding of ineffective assistance of coun4 evidence. (people v. ogunmowo (2018) 23 cal.app.5th 67, 76.) as explained below, the trial court properly concluded that improper advice or the failure to negotiate an immigration-neutral plea. i. improper immigration advice aningfully demonstrates that the advice his attorney gave him about those people v. patterson (2017) 2 cal.5th 885, 898 (patterson); in re hernandez (2019) 33 cal.app.5th 530, 544-545 (hernandez).) defendant did not carry his burden of showing that counsel gave him inaccurate or incorrect advice about the immigration consequences of his plea. it is undisputed that nsportation of marijuana charge made 4 although this specific language was not added until january 1, 2018 (stats. 2018, ch. 825,  2), it was merely [ying]petition. (camacho, supra, 32 cal.app.5th at pp. 1006-1009.) 9 him subject to mandatory deportation. substantial evidence would result in his deportation. from his largely contemporaneous notes, counsel testified that he asked defendant about his immigration status, discussed the matter over to give defendant time to consult an immigration lawyer, and then reviewed the language in the plea waiver form will result testimony that his notes accurately reflected what counsel said and did. this showing is sufficient to establish that counsel provided defendant accurate and correct advice about the immigration consequences of his plea. (e.g., people v. perez (2018) 19 cal.app.5th 818, 822, 829-830 [defense counsel reviewed plea waiver form specifying that deportation be mandatory; relief denied] (perez); people v. olvera (2018) 24 cal.app.5th 1112, 1114-1116 [same] (olvera).) defendant resists this conclusion with what boil down to three arguments. first, he argues an attorney gives incorrect advice when he (united states v. rodriguez-vega (9th cir. 2015) 797 f.3d 781, 788; people v. espinoza (2018) 27 cal.app.5th 908, 916-917 (espinoza); patterson, supra, 2 cal.5th at p. 898; see generally ins v. st. cyr. difference, for the purposes of retroactivity analysis, between 10 superseded by statute on other grounds as stated in flores-powell v. chadbourne (2010) 677 f.supp.2d 455, 467.) because endant this [plea] can counsel merely told defendant that deportation was possible. thus, defendant concludes, counsel gave him inaccurate and incorrect advice because, as noted above, deportation was virtually certain to flow from his plea. this argument fails thtestify that he would not in his notes draw the fine distinction now seeks to extrapolate from these notes. given that counsel in the same conversation also reviewed the plea waiver form defendant expressed no confusion to counsel or on the record during the plea about the immigration consequences of his plea, substantial edefendant was, in fact, consistently told by counsel that he would be deported if he pled to the transportation count. (see people v. albillar (2010) 51 cal.4th 47, 60 [substantial evidence review obligates reviewing court to review the record in the light most second, defendant contends that both he and his wife presented evidencehe by declaration, and she by testimonythat counsel never properly informed him that his plea would 11 should be disbelieved. this contention invites us to come to a different credibility determination than the trial court, an invitation we must decline when reviewing solely for substantial evidence. (people v. tapia ( although the court did not expressly make any findings about s not credible applies with equal force to the former. (see people v. harris (2015) 234 lastly, defendant urges that three recent casescamacho, supra, 32 cal.app.5th 998, espinoza, supra, 27 cal.app.5th 908, and hernandez, supra, 33 cal.app.5th 530dictate a ruling in his favor. we disagree. camacho held that a defendant was entitled to relief under section 1473.7 where his plea was certain to result in deportation, but his attorney advised him either that (camacho, at pp. 1001, 1003, 1010.) espinoza held that a defendant was entitled to relief under section 1473.7 when his plea was certain to result in deportation, but his attorney did not specifically discuss immigration consequences and at most in deportation. (espinoza, at pp. 914-918.) here, by contrast, counsel gave defendant accurate and correct advice. hernandez held that a defendant was entitled to relief pursuant to the writ of habeas corpus where her plea was certain to result in 12 deportation, but her attorney could not recall what he advised defendant and there was no evidence that the attorney followed any usual practice of reading the plea waiver form (which in that case recited that deportation was mandatory). (hernandez, supra, at pp. 544-545.) here, by contrast, counsel not only testified to his usual practice, but that testimony was bolstered ii. failure to negotiate an immigration-neutral plea a defendant may establish ineffective assistance of counsel an[] . . . immigration-disposition. (olvera, supra, 24 cal.app.5th at p. 1118; perez, supra, 19 cal.app.5th at p. 830; people v. bautista (2004) 115 cal.app.4th 229, 240.) defendant did not carry his burden of showing either element necessary to establish relief under this theory. he presented no admissible evidence of a possible immigration-neutral disposition. instead, he offered (1) his -that effect. neither constitutes admissible evidence: defendant presented no evidence that he is an expert in immigration law capable of offering an opinion regarding immigration-neutral dispositions, so the opinion in his declaration is necessarily hearsay because it originated with someone else and hence is inadmissible (evid. code,  1200); and the argument of his counsel is, obviously, also not evidence (people v. kinder (1954) 13 122 cal.app.2d 457, 463). even if we were to treat his argument as evidence, defendant has not established that pleading to health and safety code section 11379 is an -ruiz-vidal v. gonzalez (9th cir. 2007) 473 f.3d 1072, 1074-1079, but that case holds only that an immigrant cannot be removed due to a conviction under health and safety code section 11379 if nothing at issue qualifies as a controlled substance under federal immigration law. ruiz-vidal does not speak to whether the parties to the underlying criminal case may intentionally hide the ball from later scrutiny by immigration courts by omitting the otherwise qualifying controlled substance (here, marijuana) from the record of conviction. (8 u.s.c.  1227(a)(2)(b)(i) [covering offense involving more than 30 grams of marijuana].) relatedly, defendant has offered no evidence whatsoever that the people would have agreed to a disposition that involved a concealment of the underlying facts. the people were certainly under no obligation to accept such a plea (see people v. halim (2017) 14 cal.app.5th 632, 648 [section 1016.3 requires consequences in the plea negotiation does not require avoidance to be dispositive]), and we question whether the people may ethically play hide the ball in any event. because defendant did not establish any misunderstanding of the immigration consequences of his plea or otherwise prove that his counsel was constitutionally ineffective, he necessarily failed to prove any prejudice.
