(a)) and conspiracy to murder his stepfather pedro castillo ( 182, subd. (a)(1)). the jury found true special-circumstance allegations that the murder was committed in the course of a robbery and while lying in wait ( 190.2, subds. (15), (17)(a)). the trial court imposed an lwop term on the murder conviction ( 190.5, subd. (b)), and imposed and stayed a term of 25 years to life on the conviction for conspiracy to commit murder ( 654). in an unpublished opinion (people v. padilla (june 1, 2001, b135651)), this court determined there was 1 all further statutory references are to the penal code. 3 insufficient evidence to support the lying-in-wait special-circumstance finding, but otherwise affirmed the judgment of conviction. in miller v. alabama (2012) 567 u.s. 460, 476-480 (miller), the united states supreme court held that the eighth amendment of the united states constitution forth factors controlling the determination whether that penalty may be imposed on such a juvenile. (miller, supra, at p. 479.) in august 2012, the california legislature amended section 1170 to add subdivision (d)(2), which creates a postconviction resentencing proceeding for certain defendants serving lwop terms. (stats. 2012, ch. 828,  1, p. 92.) section 1170(d)(2) states in clause (i) of subparagraph (a) that defendants serving an lwop term for an offense they committed when under 18 years of age may submit a petition for recall and resentencing after having served 15 years of their sentence. clause (ii) of subparagraph (a) provides that a defendant is ineligible for recall and resentencing when the offense for which the lwop term was imposed involved specified circumstances, including that the defendant engaged in torture. under section 1170(d)(2), the petition must contain enumerated statements, including a description of the ( 1170, subd. (d)(2)(b).) as operative during the pertinent 4 period, section 1170(d)(2) further provided that if the court found that the statements in the petition were true, the court was required to hold a hearing to consider whether to recall the sentence and commitment previously ordered and to resentence the defendant . . . .(former  1170, subd. (d)(2)(e).) under that version of section 1170(d)(2), at the hearing, the court was authorized to recall the sentence and resentence the defendant upon a consideration of factors relating to the circumstances offense, and his or her conduct after it. (former  1170, subd. (d)(2)(f).)2 in august 2013, appellant filed a petition for recall and resentencing under section 1170(d)(2). when the trial court determined that he was ineligible for resentencing because his offense involved torture, appellant noticed an appeal from the ruling. in august 2014, while that appeal was pending, appellant filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the superior court, seeking resentencing under miller. later, in july 2015, the trial court conducted a hearing on the petition for writ relief and resentenced appellant to an lwop term. 2 under section 1170(d)(2), if the court declines to recall second petition after having served 20 years of his or her sentence. ( 1170, subd. (d)(2)(h).) if that petition is unsuccessful, the defendant may submit a third and final petition after having served 24 years of the sentence. (ibid.) 5 appellant appealed from that ruling. in november 2015, we reversed the denial of further proceedings, concluding there was insufficient evidence to support a finding of torture. (people v. padilla (nov. 20, 2015, b257408) [nonpub. opn.].) in january 2016, prior to any further action below 1170(d)(2) petition, the united states supreme court issued its decision in montgomery v. louisiana (2016) 577 u.s. ___[136 s.ct. 718, 727, 729, 736] (montgomery), which held that miller set forth a substantive rule that had retroactive application in state collateral review proceedings. in september 2016, following a hearing, the trial court denied section 1170(d)(2) petition. appellant noticed the appeal before us from that ruling. in october 2016, we petition for writ relief on the ground that the trial court, in ruling on the petition, exercised its discretion without the guidance provided by montgomery. (people v. padilla (2016) 4 cal.app.5th 656, 659-660, rev. granted jan. 25, 2017, s239454.) we concluded that montgomery millermontgomery, miller must be regarded as announcing a substantive rule barring lwop terms for a specific class of juvenile offenders, namely, those people v. padilla, supra, at p. 672, quoting montgomery, supra, 577 u.s. at p. ___ [136 s.ct. at p. 743].) 6 discussion appellant contends the trial court erred in denying his petition under section 1170(d)(2). as discussed below, we disagree. a. mootness at the threshold of our inquiry, we address . generally, (wilson & wilson v. city council of redwood city (2011) 191 cal.app.4th 1559, 1574, quoting younger v. superior court (1978) 21 cal.3d 102, 120.) thus, practical impact . . . .

( 190.5, subd. (b).)3 3 under subdivision (b) of section 190.5, the trial court (fn. is continued on the next page.) 7 senate bill no. 394 amends penal code sections 3051 and 4801 to designate juvenile homicide offenders sentenced to lwop terms eligible for parole during their 25th year of incarceration.4 respondent argues that because that legislation operates retroactively, it encompasses appellant, and thus effectively provides the relief he sought, namely, to reduc[e] his lwop sentence to 25 years to life in order to be in view of other recent changes of law, we conclude that this appeal is not moot, as the legislation described above does not give all the relief potentially available to appellant if resentenced. in november 2016, the voters approved proposition 57, rehabilitation act of 201which modified the procedures for charging juveniles, and amended the california constitution by adding section 32 to article 1.

(a), par. (2).) 9 terms. (cal. code regs., tit. 15,  3043.2, subd. (b)(1), (b)(2).)6 because appellant was sentenced to an lwop term, the emergency regulation, by its plain language, denies him conduct credits potentially advancing the date of the parole hearing to which he is entitled under the recent amendment to penal code section 3051. accordingly, although it is possible that the cdcr may adopt a regulation in the future 6 california code of regulations, title 15, section 3043.2 (b) notwithstanding any other authority to award or limit credit, effective may 1, 2017, the award of good conduct credit shall . . . initial parole hearing date . . . if sentenced to an indetermi-nate term with the possibility of parole pursuant to the following schedule: [] (1) no credit shall be awarded to an inmate sentenced to death or a term of life without the possibility of parole; [] (2) one day of credit for every four days of incarceration (20%) shall be awarded to an inmate serving a determinate or indeterminate term for a violent felony as defined in penal code section 667.5, subdivision (c), unless the inmate qualifies . . . or is statutorily eligible for greater credit . . . (cal. code regs., tit. 15,  3043.2, subd. (b)(1), (b)(2).) we note that because the regulation was adopted as an emergency measure, it will be repealed by operation of law if the secretary of the cdcr fails to submit a certificate of compliance by december 20, 2017. (5058.3; history foll. cal. code regs., tit.15,  3043.2; see off. of admin. law, notice of approval of emergency regulatory action (dec. 18, 2017), pp. 1-2.) 10 granting appellant such credits, they are not currently available to him unless he is resentenced to a term of 25 years to life. the appeal before us is therefore not moot. (saraswati v. county of san diego (2011) 202 cal.app.4th 917, 925 [statutory amendment did not moot appeal because it did not ensure full and timely relief to appellant].)7 b. denial of section 1170(d)(2) petition section 1170(d)(2) petition. 1. governing principles as operative at the time of the challenged ruling, section 1170(d)(2) provided that the trial court, upon finding 7 respondent has directed our attention to a recent decision, namely, people v. lozano (2017) 16 cal.app.5th 1286. there, the defendant sought relief from his lwop sentence solely under the eighth amendment, on the basis of the grounds set forth in miller and montgomery. (lozana, supra, at pp. 1288-1290.) the appellate court concluded that senate bill no. 394 mooted that claim for relief. (id. at p. 1290.) in contrast, appellant requests that he be resentenced to a 25-year-to-life sentence under section 1170, subdivision (d)(2). as explained, such a sentence would entitle him to custody credits under the new regulations established by the cdcr. for that reason, senate bill no. 394 does not moot his claim for relief. 11 certain facts (that the defendant was eligible for relief and that the petition contained specified true statements), was required a hearing to consider whether to recall the sentence . . . and to resentence the defendant in the same manner as if the defendant had not previously been sentenced, provided that the new sentence, if any, is not former  1170, subd. (d)(2)(e).) the statute enumerated factors the court was permitted to consider in determining whether to recall the consideration to the enumerated factors. (id. at subd. (d)(2)(f).) under the applicable version of section 1170(d)(2), the trial court potentially confronted two decisions at the hearing on the petition. generally, in the context of section aside or abrogate an existing sentence for a sentencing purpose. (dix v. superior court (1991) 53 cal.3d 442, 455, 456-465.) the applicable version of section 1170(d)(2) thus required the trial court first to determine whether recalling the existing sentence was appropriate; if it decided to do so, resentence the defendant in the same manner as if the defendant had not previously sentence for the defendant as a juvenile homicide offender ( 190.5, subd. (b)). ( 1170, subd. (d)(2)(e).) in view of the structure of the applicable version of section 1170(d)(2), courts have held that it neither remedied potential constitutional defects in existing lwop sentences 12 imposed on juvenile homicide offenders, nor required a determination whether those sentences were unconsti-tutional. in people v. gutierrez (2014) 58 cal.4th 1354, 1386, our supreme court concluded that the statute did not eliminate the constitutional concerns regarding the initial imposition of lwop sentences identified in miller, stating: out parole . . . remains fully effective after the enactment of section 1170(d)(2).in people v. gibson (2016) 2 cal.app.5th 315, 329-330, 331 (gibson), the appellate court concluded that the statute, in authorizing the trial court to recall an lwop sentence, review of the constitutionality ofmiller. here, our necessarily reflected a decision not to the court denied the petition appellant asserts no challenge to the ruling on the basis of the constitutional grounds identified in miller and montgomery.8 we therefore examine the relevant principles 8 the principal issues relating to the constitutionality of miller and montgomery are currently before our supreme court, which granted relief (people v. padilla, supra, 4 cal.app.5th 656, rev.

(id. at pp. 307-308.) in 1999, after being convicted on two counts of first degree murder and one count of attempted murder, the defendant received an lwop term. (id. at p. 308.) later, the trial court declined to recall and resentence the defendant under the applicable version of section 1170(d)(2), even though it found the existence of several statutory factors favorable to the defendant. (willover, supra, 248 cal.app.4th at p. 306.) specifically, the court determined that the defendant had no record of violent crimes prior to his offenses; that he had engaged in behaviorincarcerated, resulting in 17 that he had maintained connections with his family and friends; and that he had not been disciplined for violent conduct during the prior five years. (id. at pp. 316-317, 320-322.) the court further determined that other statutory factors did not support relief, concluding that the defendant had been convicted of one murder as the direct perpetrator; that the adult accomplice had not significantly influenced the defendant to commit the crimes; that the defendant had not lacked adult supervision; and that the defendant did not suffer from any trauma, mental illness, or cognitive limitations, notwithstanding the existence of some evidence that he had used methamphetamines and had a personality disorder.

that appellant was subject to fantasies derived from horror movies; and that he killed his mother while under the influence of marijuana. the assessment opined that for rehabilitation, in view of the steps he had taken toward rehabilitation while serving his sentence. after reviewing records for appellant held by the cdcr, retired associate warden daniel j. fulks stated that a-free for all but one of his years of incarceration, and there was no documented criminal or gang activity. according to fulks, appel, which occurred in 2000, was for possession of inmate-manufactured alcohol. fulks further stated that while incarcerated, appellant had earned his ged and participated in several vocational training programs. barry a. krisberg, a ph.d. in sociology, opined that imprisoned, was respectful to staff anadvantage of every program and self-help opportunity available to him . . . .although initially placed in a high-security facility, he had been moved to less restrictive housing as soon as that was allowableevidence that appellant displayed significant mental health or substance abuse issues while incarcerated. 22 in addition to this evidence, appellant submitted declarations from several persons familiar with his religious beliefs. john pape stated he was a religious volunteer at central juvenile hall, where appellant was once placed. when appellant was moved to prison, pape maintained contact with him through visits, phone calls, and letters. according to pape, appellant was an immature 16-year-old when they first met. since that time, appellant had matured ongoing participation in religious programs reflected a genuine desire and capacity for rehabilitation . . . . david waagan, a member of the jstated that in 2005appellant was incarcerated at pelican bay state prison. anindividual must undergo lengthy preparation and demonstrate gerald gormly and david griffin, who had contact with appellant at pelican bay state prison as religious volunteers, stated that he demonstrated maturity and sincere religious convictions. griffin also noted that while in prison, -writer to c. testimony at hearing on petition for writ relief appellant also provided transcripts of griffin and pape 23 writ of habeas corpus. griffin stated that in 2006, he had contact with appellant over a period of approximately six months. witness. few inmates had done so, as baptism as a itness required comprehensive knowledge of the bible. griffin grammar, spelling, and writing ability had greatly improved while he was incarcerated. when cross-examined, griffin acknowledged that he was not a trained psychologist, and , including that appellant had contemplated killing other people in addition to his mother. pape testified that hconduct to be sincere. during cross-examination, in addition to acknowledging that he had no background in psychology, he stated that he knew only some details of the murder, and was unaware that after the murder, appellant displayed an ,secure a copy of its sequel. d. hearing and ruling at the beginning of the hearing on the section 1170(d)(2) petition, the trial court stated that it had reviewed all the submitted evidence, and announced its ] home environment, the circumstances of the offense, [and] his actions subsequent to the conviction as it relates to 24 rehabilitation, remorse, [and] maturity . . . .counsel argued that each statutory factor favored appellant, immaturity. respondent maintained that appellant had loving parents, and that his good behavior in prison mirrored the good behavior he displayed before the murder, during which he planned a string of murders. in denying the petition, the trial court explained that it had relied primarily after observing that appellant had parental support, that his home life reflected no substance abuse, and that he had no prior history of violence, the court set forth in detail the to kill pedro and several other people. turning to whether appellant had matured and accepted responsibility, the court -- which had presided at -- during the hearing as identical to the conduct he displayed at trial when pictures were shown of s body. the court further explained why it had rejected the testimony from griffin and pape, as well as the declaration from fulks, to the extent they were offered to show that appellant had changed. the court stated that griffindiscussspiritual with appellant had rendered griffin knowledgeable of spelling and syntax, but unaware of the key offenses; that pape had little to say, other than that 25 appellant had matured; and that fulks had never met appellant. done anything to make himself a better person. i think what he has done is just as he did before the murders. he is planning and has planned for some time to try to mold himself into an image that would fool the people that are looking at him. . . . [rehabilitate himself except what he has thought in my opinion would benefit him by getting a better sentence for 3. analysis we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the petition. because the applicable version of section 1170(d)(2) did not require the court to set forth its assessment of each statutory factor, the court was not obliged to state what weight it gave, if any, to certain factors potentially favorable to appellant.13 (see people v. 13 we note that the statute mandated only that the court factors, namely, whether appellant was convicted of felony murder or as an aider-and-abettor, whether appellant had a prior history of violent crime, whether appellant had an adult accomplice, and whether appellant performed acts or showed remorse while incarcerated. (former  1170, subd. (d)(2)(g).) here, the court referred to all four factors. 26 lamb (1988) 206 cal.app.3d 397, 402.) although the court placed special emphasis on the egregious circumstances of and its finding that appellant had not it necessarily found the existence of other factors unfavorable to appellant, namely, that the defendant had not lacked adult supervision; that he suffered from no material trauma, mental illness, or cognitive limitations; that he was the direct perpetrator of his mother; and that no adult accomplice was involved. in view of willover, urder was calculated and callous, coupled with the other factors, constituted ruling. (willover, supra, 248 cal.app.4th at p. 323.) es on the trial lant had not changed. he argues that the court conclusion was unreasonable, as that conduct began long before miller and section 1170(d)(2) offered the prospect of eventual release. he also contends the ruling denied his due process rights. as explained below, we reject those contentions. at the outset, we observe that the applicable version of section 1170(d)(2) did not require the court to make any specific finding in determining whether to recall or decline to court to consider various factors, including whether [d] performed acts that tend[ed] to indicate 27 rehabilitation or the potential for rehabilitation, . . . or [had (former  1170, subd. (d)(2)(f)(vi)), the statute did not mandate recall where evidence of such factors was present. the statute thus permitted the court to deny relief even though it found that the defendant showed rehabilitative acts or remorse. (willover, supra, 248 cal.app.4th at pp. 322-324.) furthermore, in suitable circumstances, the court was permitted to reject undisputed evidence of good conduct as insufficient to show (gibson, supra, 2 cal.app.5th at pp. 328-329 [affirming trial based on the brevity of the period of good conduct].) here, pointing to the submitted evidence and done anything to rehabilitate himself except what he has thought . . . would benefit him by getting a better sentence on the casereasonably be understood to refer solely to a 25-year-to-life conduct predated miller and the enactment of section 1170(d)(2). rather, the courtthat appellant sought to achieve better conditions of incarceration, to the extent available. that interpretation is d conduct, he had been moved to allowable 28 in our view, the trial court reasonably found that appellant had failed to demonstrate a genuine change of attitude, notwithstanding the uncontroverted evidence of his good conduct in prison. as the court noted, appellant planned a series of murders while manifesting an appearance of good conduct; furthermore, the testimony from the two witnesses appellant offered to establish the sincerity of his religious beliefs -- namely, griffin and pape -- disclosed that appellant apparently had never reflected on the egregious details of his crimes while talking to them, as they were unaware of those details. additionally, because the statute did not circumscribe the pertinent factors, the conduct at the trial and during the hearing on the section 1170(d)(2) petition.14 (see alvarez, supra, 14 cal.4th at pp. 977-979.) in a related contention, appellant maintains that the 14 even had the trial court improperly assessed no reversible error. as explained in gibson, under the applicable version of section 1170(d)(2), an incorrect assessment of a single factor was harmless when the trial court also based its ruling on other factors properly supported in the record. (gibson, supra, 2 cal.app.5th at pp. 328-329.) here, the court identified the circumstances of necessarily found the existence of other factors unfavorable to appellant. 29 process because it arbitrarily denied him a liberty interest provided by state law (hicks v. oklahoma (1980) 447 u.s. 343, 346; hewitt v. helms (1983) 459 u.s. 460, 466, overruled on another point in sandin v. conner (1995) 515 u.s. 472, 483-484; in re head (1983) 147 cal.app.3d 1125, 1132). that contention fails, as appellant has not shown the trial court contravened state law in ruling on his petition. (see people v. prince (2007) 40 cal.4th 1179, 1272-1273 & fns. 20, 21.) in sum, the trial court did not err in declining to 15 15 appellant has requested that upon ordering remand, we direct that further proceedings be heard before a different judge (code civ. proc.,  170.1, subd. (c)). the contention underlying the request is that the trial court, in appearance of bias. in view of our conclusion, it is unnecessary to address the request, as no remand is required. to the extent appellant may seek a reversal of the ruling on the basis of judicial bias, we conclude that the trial the evidence, and do not demonstrate bias.
