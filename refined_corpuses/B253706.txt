the state of california second appellate district division five the people, plaintiff and respondent, v. arturo pavon, defendant and appellant. b253706 (los angeles county super. ct. no. ba381363) appeal from a judgment of the superior court of los angeles county, c.h. rehm, jr., judge. affirmed with modifications. nancy j. king, under appointment by the court of appeal, for defendant and appellant arturo pavon. kamala d. harris, attorney general, gerald a. engler, chief assistant attorney general, lance e. winters, senior assistant attorney general, steven d. matthews and ryan m. smith, deputy attorneys general, for plaintiff and respondent. 2 appellant arturo pavon was convicted, following a jury trial, of two counts of continuous sexual abuse of a child in violation of penal code1 section 288.5, subdivision (a), and eleven counts of committing a lewd act on a child in violation of 288, subdivision (a). the victims of th.v. and b.f., and b.f.half-sisters a.v. and k v. the jury found true the allegations that appellant committed the lewd acts on more than one victim within the meaning of section 667.61, subdivisions (b) and (e). the jury also found true the allegation that the statute of limitations was extended for the crimes against g.v. and a.v. pursuant to section 803, subdivision (f). the trial court sentenced appellant to consecutive upper terms of 16 years for the two section 288.5 convictions plus four consecutive terms of 15 years to life for the counts 7, 11, 16 and 18 section 288 convictions, pursuant to section 667.61. appellant appeals from the judgment of conviction, contending that the prosecutor committed prejudicial misconduct during the examination of five prosecution witnesses and the cross-examination of two defense witnesses. appellant also contends the abstract of judgment must be corrected with respect to the fines and fees, and the matter remanded for a determination of his ability to pay. we make a number of corrections to the fines and fees, as reflected below in the disposition. the judgment of conviction is affirmed in all other respects. facts g.v. was born on june 20, 1985. she lived with him from birth until she was 17 years old. appellant also had a daughter in mexico with victoria r. this daughter, b.f., was born on june 16, 1982. later, victoria had two daughters with another man. a.v. was born on december 23, 1984, and k.v. was born on november 7, 1985. victoria and the three girls lived in mexico until 1993. 1 all further statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise specified. 3 in 1993, appellant brought b.f. to los angeles. later in 1993, victoria moved to los angeles, bringing a.v. with her. victoria wanted to be with appellant. in 1995, k.v. came to los angeles to live with her mother, sisters, and appellant. appellant was convicted of sexually abusing all four girls. the abuse began with g.v. appellant was convicted of continuous sexual abuse of g.v. between june 20, 1990, when she turned five, and june 19, 1995. appellant was also convicted of four counts of lewd acts on g.v. for the abuse which occurred between june 20, 1996 and june 19, 1999, the day before her fourteenth birthday. appellant next began sexually abusing a.v., beginning in 1993 when she was nine years old. appellant was convicted of continuous sexual abuse of a.v. between april 1, 1993, and december 31, 1994. he was also convicted of one count of lewd acts on a.v., occurring between january 1, 1995, and december 22, 1998, the day before her fourteenth birthday. the abuse continued with b.f., beginning in 1995 when she was 12 years old. appellant was convicted of four counts of lewd acts on b.f., all occurring between january 1, 1995, when b.f. was 12 years old, and june 15, 1996, the day before her fourteenth birthday. appellant also began sexually abusing k.v. in 1995, when she was nine years old. appellant was convicted of two counts of lewd acts on k.v., both occurring between january 1, 1995, and november 6, 1999, the day before her fourteenth birthday. appellant had at least two other children who lived with him during the period the sexual abuse occurred. son luis was g.v.at trial. daughter leticia f. was b.f.-sister. leticia testified at trial and provided partial corroboration for b.f.sexual abuse claims. appellant called two witnesses to testify in his defense. the first was lizbeth anzures. g.v. had testified that she tried to warn lizbeth about appellant because she was worried that if lizbeth and luis had children, appellant would molest them. lizbeth gave a different account of events. according to lizbeth, she met and lived with g.v. for about a month when lizbeth was 11 years old and g.v. was 16. g.v. 4 told lizbeth but she never described any other incidents with appellant. lizbeth recalled that g.v. and appellant seemed to have a good relationship. aria flores. she testified that g.v. lived with her for a few months in 2003, when g.v. was pregnant. one night, g.v. told maria that she had been molested when she was three years old at a place she lived with her mother. her parents sometimes left her alone with a man who wore glasses, and he molested her. she was angry that her parents has not protected her. g.v. never told maria that appellant had abused her. discussion 1. prosecutorial misconduct appellant contends the prosecutor committed misconduct by asking leading questions of prosecution witnesses g.v., b.f., a.v., k.v., and leticia and also by asking defense witnesses lizbeth and maria questions which were intended to elicit inadmissible evidence or to encourage the jury to speculate. appellant further contends the prosecutor . appellant contends this misconduct violated his right to due process and a fair trial. respondent contends appellant has forfeited this claim by failing to object on the ground of prosecutorial misconduct and failing to request an admonition. appellant contends that if his claim is forfeited, he received ineffective assistance of counsel. a. general law the applicable federal and state standards regarding prosecutorial misconduct are well established. s . . . intemperate behavior violates the federal constitution when it so egregious that it infects the trial with such unfairness as to make the conviction a denial of due process. (people v. gionis (1995) 9 cal.4th 1196, 1214; people v. espinoza (1992) 3 cal.4th 806, 820.) conduct by a prosecutor that does not render a criminal trial fundamentally unfair is 5 prosecutorial misconduct under state law only if it involves the use of deceptive or reprehensible methods to attempt to persuade either the court or the jury. (hill, supra, 17 cal.4th at 819.)(people v. gray (2005) 37 cal.4th 168, 215-216.) showing misconduct is not sufficient; an appellant must also demonstrate that his right to a fair trial was prejudiced by the misconduct. (people v. bolton (1979) 23 cal.3d 208, 214.) a defendant may not complain of prosecutorial misconduct on appeal if he failed to object to the conduct at trial or to request a curative admonition. (people v. pearson (2013) 56 cal.4th 393, 426.) b. leading questions to prosecution witnesses excessive use of leading questions to prosecution witnesses constituted misconduct. ests to the witness the answer that the examining party (evid. code  764.) leading questions may be asked of witnesses on cross-examination without restriction. (evid. code  767.) leading questions may be asked on direct examination only under special circumstances where the interests of justice require it. (ibid.) they may, for example, be used on direct people v. williams (1997) 16 cal.4th 635, 672.) the use of leading questions constitutes misconduct only if there is a that such examination had the effect of deliberately producing inadmissible evidence or called for inadmissible and prejudicial answers. (people v. hayes (1971) 19 cal.app.3d 459, 470.) there is no misconduct if the leading questions produced only evidence that could properly have been elicited by questions not objectionable in form. (ibid.) thus, simply objecting that a question is leading is not sufficient to alert the trial court that misconduct is being claimed. accordingly, a claim of prosecutorial misconduct based on people v. williams, supra, 16 cal.4th at 673 6 [claim of misconduct not preserved when defense counsel objected to questions as leading, but did not object to questions as constituting misconduct].) here, although appellant objected to approximately 50 questions as leading, he did not object that the questions constituted misconduct. accordingly, he has forfeited his claim of prosecutorial misconduct. (people v. williams, supra, 16 cal.4th at 673.) appellant contends that his counsel was ineffective in failing to object properly and preserve the claim. appellant has the burden of proving ineffective assistance of counsel. (people v. pope (1979) 23 cal.3d 412, 425.) in order to establish such a claim, appellant mus performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness, s error, a different result would have been reasonably probable. (strickland v. washington (1984) 466 u.s. 668, 687-688, 694; people v. ledesma (1987) 43 cal.3d 171, 216-a reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to under (strickland v. washington, supra, 466 u.s. at 694.) appellant contends because the questions were excessive. appellant has not shown an excessive use of leading questions.2 the effect of deliberately producing inadmissible evidence or called for inadmissible and people v. hayes, supra,19 cal.app.3d at 470.) 2 appellant identifies five prosecution witnesses of whom the prosecutor asked leading questions. in total, the prosecutor asked these five witnesses about 2000 questions as leading. sixteen of those objections were sustained. specifically, the prosecutor asked g.v. about 800 questions. appellant objected to four questions as sustained three of the individual objections. appellant objected to nine of the 600 questions the prosecutor asked a.v. five objections were sustained. appellant objected to 11 of the 700 questions the prosecutor asked b.f. the court sustained four of the objections. appellant objected to two of the 140 questions the prosecutor asked leticia. the court sustained one objection. appellant objected to six of the 240 questions the prosecutor asked k.v. the court sustained three of the objections. 7 since appellant has not shown that prosecutorial misconduct occurred, his counsel acted reasonably in not objecting that the leading questions constituted misconduct. counsel is not required to make futile objections. (people v. ochoa (1998) 19 cal.4th 353, 427-428, 432 [meritless motion to exclude]; people v. price (1991) 1 cal.4th 324, 386-387.) c. questions to defense witnesses appellant contends the prosecutor asked defense witnesses lizbeth and maria questions which were intended to elicit inadmissible evidence or to encourage the jury to speculate. it is, of course, misconduct for a prosecutor to intentionally elicit inadmissible testimony. [citations.] [citation.] such misconduct is exacerbated if the prosecutor continues to attempt to elicit such evidence after defense counsel has objected. (people v. smithey (1999) 20 cal.4th 936, 960.)people v. tully (2012) 54 cal.4th 952, 1035.) appellant objected that the questions at issue called for speculative or irrelevant evidence and were argumentative. assuming these objections were sufficient to alert the court to a claim of misconduct, appellant did not request any curative admonitions, and so has forfeited his claims. (see people v. pearson, supra, 56 cal.4th at 426.) appellant contends an admonition would have been ineffective, and so his claim has been preserved. (see people v. hill (1998) 17 cal.4th 800, 820.) as we discuss below, there was little to no prejudicial potential there is no reason to believe an admonition would have been ineffective. this minimal prejudicial potential fails. i. questions about absent witness appellant contends that the prosecutor committed misconduct by asking lizbeth a series of questions involving , luis from court. on 8 and to a few as calling for irrelevant evidence. all of the objections were sustained before the witness answered. the jury was aware through other properly introduced evidence that appellant had a son, luis, who was a few years older than g.v. and who lived with appellant during some of the time that the sexual abuse occurred. by the end of trial they were no doubt aware that luis uestions at most suggested that luis did not want to come to court. there could be a variety of reasons for this reluctance. the did not suggest any improper motive. thus, any slight prejudicial potential stions, could have easily been dispelled with an admonition to the jury that the jury should not speculate about those reasons. since an admonition would have dispelled any prejudicial potential, appellant has forfeited his claim by failing to seek such an admonition. (people v. pearson, supra, 56 cal.4th at 426.) appellant contends that to seek an admonition, he received ineffective assistance of counsel. in order to establish such a claim, appellant s error, a different result would have been reasonably probable. (strickland v. washington, supra, 466 u.s. at 687-688, 694; people v. ledesma, supra, 43 cal.3d at 216-218.) here, although counsel did not request a specific admonition concerning the questions about luis, the jury was thoroughly instructed on how to view statements and questions by the attorneys. before trial, the jury was instructed generally thou must not consider as evidence any statement by an attorney during the trial. [] similarly, a question by an attorney . . . is not evidence. a question is not evidence . . . therefore you must not suspect that any insinuation or mere suggestion tion is sustained . . . [y]ou must before deliberations began, the jury was again the attorneys 9 say is evidence . . . their questions are not evidence. . . . do not assume something is true addition, the court told the juryquestion. if the witness was not permitted to answer, do not guess what the answer might have been or why i ruled as i did. is that the questions were not evidence, that they should not suspect that any insinuation in a question was true and they should not speculate about the answer to a question when an objection was sustained. they were reminded of these rules before deliberation. these instructions were more than sufficient to prevent any prejudice questions. there is no reasonable probability that appellant would have received a more favorable outcome if his counsel had requested a specific admonition. ii. delay in reporting molestation appellant contends the prosecutor also committed misconduct by asking lizbeth two questions about her failure to tell anyone, including luis, about a 12 year old conversation with g.v. in which g.v. stated that appellant had molested her. the first as conversation that happened to [g.v.] first question was argumentative, it did not result in is nothing inherently improper about cross-examining a defense witness as to his failure to come forward at an earlier date. in fact, the information discovered during this type of questioning may well aid the trier of fact in its effort to determine whether the testimony people v. ratliff (1987) 189 10 cal.app.3d 696, 701.) , ibid.) since a prosecutor is free to comment on the evidence in opening and closing arguments, any poscomes from its use in a question, which could suggest that it was an evidentiary fact that dispelled comment and reminding the jury of the pre-trial instruction thaevidence . . . therefore you must not suspect that any insinuation or mere suggestion by a since an admonition could have dispelled any potential prejudice from the prosecuappellant has forfeited his claim by failing to seek such an admonition. (people v. pearson, supra, 56 cal.4th at 426.) to seek an admonition, he received ineffective assistance of counsel. in order to establish such a claim, appellant s error, a different result would have been reasonably probable. (strickland v. washington, supra, 466 u.s. at 687-688, 694; people v. ledesma, supra, 43 cal.3d at 216-218.) here, although counsel did not request a specific admonition concerning the ry was thoroughly instructed on how to view statements and questions by the attorneys, as is detailed above. thus, the jury was aware when they should not suspect that any insinuation in the question was true. they were reminded of these rules before deliberation. these instructions were more than sufficient to prevent presumed to appellant would have received a more favorable outcome if his counsel had requested a specific admonition. 11 iii. berating a witness appellant contends the prosecutor also committed misconduct by ingand asking questions that invited the jury to speculate. the fisher about these statements that [g.v.] ense counsel objected that the question was vague and ambiguous, and the objection was sustained. the witness nonetheless ent was argumentative, and the objection was sustained. this exchange is awkward but in no way improper. the prosecutor next how come you are not answering counsel objected that the question was argumentative, and the objection was sustained. even assuming that the question suggested that maria was deliberately not answering questions for an improper purpose, the record shows that maria had in fact been attempting to answer the asked clear and specific questions, maria provided appropriate answers. the jury was no doubt aware of this fact. an admonition from the court reminding the jury that nothing would have been sufficient to dispel any potential prejudice from the question. since an admonition could have dispelled any potential prejudice from the admonition. (people v. pearson, supra, 56 cal.4th at 426.) to seek an admonition, he received ineffective assistance of counsel. in order to establish such a claim, appellant s error, a different result would have been reasonably probable. (strickland v. washington, supra, 466 u.s. at 687-688, 694; people v. ledesma, supra, 43 cal.3d at 216-218.) about the argumentative question to maria, the jury was thoroughly instructed on how to 12 view statements and questions by attorneys, as is detailed above. thus, they were aware when they heard the question that it was not evidence and that they should not suspect that any insinuation in the question was true. they were reminded of these rules before deliberation. these instructions were more than sufficient to prevent any prejudice from instructions. there is no reasonable probability that appellant would have received a more favorable outcome if his counsel had requested a specific admonition. 2. fines and fees appellant contends (1) the abstract of judgment should be corrected to reflect the the section 290.3 fine must be reduced to the amount in effect when he committed his offenses; (3) the section 294 child abuse fine must be stricken; (4) the government code section 76104.7 dna assessment must be stricken; and (5) the government code section 70373 assessment must be stricken. respondent agrees with the first four contentions, but does not agree the government code section 70373 must be stricken. respondent is correct. a. restitution and parole revocation fines at the sentencing hearing, the trial court properly imposed a section 1202.4 restitution fine of $200 and a section 1202.45 parole revocation fine of $200. the minute order for the sentencing hearing and the abstract of judgment show $280 fines. the oral pronouncement of sentence controls. (people v. mitchell (2001) 26 cal.4th 181, 184-186.) the minute order and abstract of judgment are ordered corrected. (ibid.) b. section 290.3 sex offender fine when appellant was sentenced, section 290.3, subdivision (a) provided for a fine that amount on appellant. however, a13 occurred from 1990 through 1999. at that time section 290.3, subdivision (a), provided reduced to the $200 amount in effect when he committed his offenses. (people v. valenzuela (2009) 172 cal.app.4th 1246, 1248.) c. section 294 child abuse fine the trial court imposed a $500 fine pursuant to section 294, subdivision (b)(1). that section became effective on january 1, 1994. alleged to have occurred after that date. however, aof g.v. was alleged to have occurred between 1990 and 1996, while his sexual abuse of a.v. was alleged to have occurred between april 1, 1993 and december 31, 1994. while it is quite possible the abuse occurred before 1994, t specific as to time, and the jury did not make any findings concerning the specific dates the abuse occurred. thus, it is not clear whether appellant was convicted for offenses which occurred after the enactment of section 294. (people v. voit (2011) 200 cal.app.4th 1353, 1372; people v. hiscox (2006) 136 cal.app.4th 253, 257-261 [where offenses were alleged to have occurred between 1992 and 1996, but testimony was not specific about dates of abuse and jury did not make findings about dates, defendant could not be sentenced under statute which became effective in 1994; such a sentence would violate ex post facto prohibitions]; see people v. saelee (1995) 35 cal.app.4th 27, 30 [under ex post facto principles, amount of fine is calculated as of the date of the offense].) accordingly, the fine must be stricken. d. dna assessment the trial court imposed a $20 dna assessment fee pursuant to government code section 76104.7. that section became effective on july 12, 2006. (assem. bill no. 1806 (2005-2006 reg. sess.)  18.) ex post facto principles preclude the imposition of the assessment. (see people v. voit, supra, 200 cal.app.4th at 1372.) it must be stricken. 14 e. government code section 70373 assessment the trial court imposed a $390 assessment pursuant to government code section 70373convicted in this matter on december 3, 2013. numerous courts have held that because the assessment is tied to a conviction, it is meant to apply to any conviction suffered after the january 2009 effective date of the statute, regardless of the date of the offense. (people v. castillo (2010) 182 cal.app.4th 1410; see people v. cortez (2010) 189 cal.app.4th 1436, 1443-1444; people v. lopez (2010) 188 cal.app.4th 474, 480-480; people v. mendez (2010) 188 cal.app.4th 47, 60-61; people v. phillips (2010) 186 cal.app.4th 475, 477-479; see also people v. davis (2010) 185 cal.app.4th 998, 1000.) appellant contends those cases are wrongly decided. appellant urges that we follow the reasoning of people v. high (2004) 119 cal.app.4th 1192, which found that the state court construction penalty imposed under government code section 70372 was punitive and subject to ex post facto restrictions. there are numerous differences between government code sections 70372 and 70373. a defendant is required to pay, thus showing a penal purpose by the legislature. section 70373 uses the for the money a defendant is required to pay and so does not indicate a penal purpose. we find the reasoning of castillo, which concerns section 70372, to be persuasive.3 3 we note that castillo and high are both decisions of the third district court of appeal. the author of castillo, justice butz, is one of the justices who had earlier decided high. justice robie, another of the justices who decided high, also participated in castillo. presumably, they did not believe that the reasoning in castillo was inconsistent with their earlier decision in high. 15 disposition the fine imposed pursuant to section 290.3 is reduced to $30. the section 294 child abuse fine and the government code section 76104.7 dna assessment are both stricken. the clerk of the superior court is directed to prepare an amended abstract of judgment reflecting these changes and also showing that the correct amount of the section 1202.4 restitution fine is $200 and the correct amount of the section 1202.45 parole revocation fine is also $200. the judgment is affirmed in all other respects. not to be published in the official reports kirschner, j. we concur: mosk, acting p.j. kriegler, j. judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
