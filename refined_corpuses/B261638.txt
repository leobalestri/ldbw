(evid. code,  452, subd. (d), 459, subd. (a).) 3 between 2003 and 2009, sinohue sexually molested another victim, d.l., who sinohue like a family member. sinohue purchased expensive items for d.l., such as a cellular telephone and a flat screen television, and the two spent a great deal of time together visiting amusement parksairplane, among other things. sinohue began molesting d.l. in 2003 or 2004, when d.l. was six or seven years old. the molestation included sexual fondling, masturbation, oral copulation and attempted anal penetration. sinohue also showed d.l. pornography. he told d.l. that these d.l. accompanied his aunt and sinohue on a trip to hawaii in the summer of 2009, where sinohue continued to sexually abuse d.l. d.l. did not report the abuse because although he felt .order against him. other family members and close family friends expressed concern j.k. became acquainted with d.l. when his family visited los angeles; he noticed that sinohue was treating d.l. the same way he had treated j.k. concerned, j.k. told a family friend to keep sinohue away from his children. thereafter, both d.l. and j.k. disclosed that sinohue had molested them. 2. procedure a. trial and original sentence the jury found sinohue guilty of five counts: three counts of committing a lewd act upon a child under the age of 14 (pen. code,  288, subd. (a),2 counts 1, 3, and 4), and continuous sexual abuse of a child under the age of 14 ( 288.5, subd. (a), counts 2 and 5.) the jury further found that sinohue had substantial sexual contact with both victims ( 1203.066, subd. (a)(8)) and found true a multiple victim allegation. ( 667.61.) as to the offenses against j.k. (counts 3, 4, and 5), the jury found sinohue 2 all further undesignated statutory references are to the penal code. 4 used obscene matter or matter depicting sexual conduct in commission of the offenses ( 1203.066, subd. (a)(9)). the trial court sentenced sinohue on all counts under the to a term of 30 years in prison, configured as follows: on count 2, 15 years to life; on count 5, 15 years to life, to be served consecutive to the sentence in count 2; and on counts 1, 3, and 4, concurrent terms of 15 years to life. b. sinohue appealed. we affirmed his convictions in an unpublished opinion. (people v. sinohue (apr. 15, 2014, b237301) [nonpub. opn.].) however, we vacated the sentence imposed on count 5, continuous sexual abuse of j.k. in violation of section 288.5. in 1998 and 1999, when sinohue committed the offense, violation of section 288.5 was not listed in section 667.61 as an offense subject to one strike sentencing.3 instead, the offense was punishable by 6, 12, or 16 years in prison. (see  288.5, subd. (a).) we remanded for resentencing. c. proceedings on remand and appeal on remand, sinohue argued that (1) he was eligible for probation on count 5 pursuant to former section 1203.066; (2) if the trial court denied probation, it should order the sentence in count 5 to run concurrently to that imposed on count 2; and (3) a low term sentence was appropriate. the trial court declined to order probation on count 5 as the defense requested. instead, it sentenced sinohue to the determinate high term of 16 years on count 5, to be served consecutively to the term imposed on count 2. it did not alter the sentence originally imposed on the remaining four counts. sinohue filed a timely notice of appeal. 3 an amendment that took effect on september 20, 2006 added the offense of continuous sexual abuse of a child to the list of offenses subject to the one strike law. (stats. 2006, ch. 337,  33.) 5 discussion 1. ligibility for probation under section 1203.066, former subdivision (c) sinohue contends that the trial court failed in its duty to consider whether he qualified for probation on the section 288, subdivision (a) counts (counts 1, 3, and 4). he argues that sentence, in that he could not have been sentenced under the one strike law if he qualified for probation, even if the court declined to actually grant probation. a. sentencing under the one strike law section 667.61, the one strike law, provides that a defendant must be sentenced to an indeterminate life sentence when he or she has been convicted of an enumerated sex offense specified in section 667.61, subdivision (c), under one or more of the circumstances enumerated in subdivisions (d) or (e) of the statute. (see people v. wutzke (2002) 28 cal.4th 923, 930.) if the defendant is convicted of a section 667.61, subdivision (c) offense and one subdivision (e) circumstance exists, he or she must be sentenced to life in prison and is ineligible for parole for 15 years. (people v. wutzke, supra, at p. 930.) one of the crimes enumerated in section 667.61, subdivision (c) is violation of section 288, subdivision (a), commission of a lewd act on a child under 14 years old. ( 667.61, former subd. (c)(7).) one of the subdivision (e) circumstances is that the defendant has been convicted in the present case or cases of committing an offense specified in subdivision (c) against more than one victim. ( 667.61, former subd. (e)(5).) the jury here convicted sinohue of violating section 288, subdivision (a) in counts 1, 3, and 4, and found the multiple victim allegation true. until 2006, section 667.61 provided that the one strike law applied to violations of section 288, subdivision people v. wutzke, supra, 28 cal.4th at p. 930.) in 2006, the legislature amended section 667.61 to eliminate the probation qualification language. after the 2006 amendment, which took effect on september 20, 2006, any violation of section 288, subdivision (a) is a covered 6 ation. (see  667.61, subd. (c)(8); stats. 2006, ch. 337,  33.) b. probation eligibility under section 1203.066 the version of section 1203.066 in effect in 1998 and 1999,4 when sinohue committed the offenses against victim j.k., provided in pertinent part: (a) notwithstanding section 1203 or any other law, probation shall not be granted to . . . any of the following persons: [] . . . [] (7) a person who is convicted of committing a violation of section 288 or 288.5 against more than one victim. [] (8) a person who, in violating section 288 or 288.5, has substantial sexual conduct with a victim who is under 14 years of age. [] (9) a person who, in violating section 288 or 288.5, used obscene matter, as defined in section 311, or matter, as defined in section 311, depicting sexual conduct, as defined in section 311.3.true. however, section 1203.066, subdivision (c) provided that paragraphs (7), (8), and (9) of subdivision (a) shall not apply when the court makes all of the following findings: s natural parent, adoptive parent, stepparent, relativs househs household. (2) a grant of probation to the defendant is in the best interest of the child. (3) rehabilitation of the defendant is feasible, the defendant is amenable to undergoing treatment, and the defendant is placed in a recognized treatment program designed to deal with child molestation immediately after the grant of probation or the suspension of execution or imposition of sentence. (4) the defendant is removed from the household of the victim until the court determines that the best interests of the victim would be served by returning the defendant to the household of the victim. . . . 4 unless otherwise stated, further references to section 1203.066 are to the version in effect in 1998. we assume, without deciding, that the 1998 version of section 1203.066 is applicable here. 7 (5) there is no threat of physical harm to the child victim if probation is section 1203.066, subdivision (c)(5) the court upon making its findings pursuant to this subdivision is not precluded from sentencing the defendant to jail or prison, but retains the discretion not to do so. the court shall state its reasons on the record for whatever sentence it imposes on the defendant. thus, sinohue was presumptively ineligible for probation unless he demonstrated eligibility under section 1203.066, subdivision (c). that section 1203.066, subdivision (a)(7), (8), or (9) applies. (people v. groomes (1993) 14 cal.app.4th 84, 88-89.) all the id. at p. 89; people v. wutzke, supra, 28 cal.4th at p. 932.) the defendant has the burden to present evidence showing he is entitled to consideration for probation under section 1203.066, subdivision (c). (people v. groomes, supra, at p. 89; people v. lammey (1989) 216 cal.app.3d 92, 98.) under the plain terms of the statute, even if the court finds all five section 1203.066 requirements have been established, it is not required to grant probation. (people v. wutzke, supra, at p. 932, fn. 7, 942.) a trial court has broad discretion to grant or deny probation, and its decision denying probation will be reversed people v. groomes, supra, at p. 87.) c. sinohue argues that he presented sufficient evidence from which the trial court could have concluded each of the five section 1203.066, subdivision (c) requirements were met667.61, former subdivision (c)(7). if the trial court made such findings, he avers, the one strike law could not have applied to the section 288, subdivision (a) offenses in counts 1, 3, and 4. the only circumstance bringing his crimes within the one strike multiple victim circumstance specified in section 667.61, former 8 defendant has been convicted in the present case or cases of committing an offense specified in subdivision (c) added.) sinohue argues that, if he qualified for probation, the section 288, subdivision (a) offenses were not ones specified in section 1203.066, subdivision (c); the multiple victim circumstance was therefore inapplicable; and as a result, he could not be sentenced under the one strike law on any of the counts. sinohue acknowledges that the trial court was unlikely to actually grant probation even if it found he qualified under section 1203.066. however, in his view, based on the statutory language, the relevant question for purposes of section 667.61, former subdivision (c)(7) is not whether he was actually granted not consider his eligibility for probation and expressly declined to make any findings on the question, thereby violating his due process rights. he urges that remand is required to allow the trial court to determine whether he was qualified for probation. d. discussion (i) forfeiture y of reasons. he was qualified for probation on counts 1, 3, and 4, and his related challenge to one strike sentencing on counts 1 through 4, have been forfeited. sinohue did not argue in his first appeal that counts 1, 3issue in a previous appeal but did not do so, the defendant may be deemed to have waived the right to raise the issue in a subsequent appeal, absent a showing of good cause or people v. senior (1995) 33 cal.app.4th 531, 533, 538.) the brought his first appeal. (see id. at p. 538 ibid.) sinohue attempts to justify his failure to raise the probation qualification issue in his first appeal on the ground that the contention had, at that point, been forfeited because 9 trial counsel had contentions were forfeited for purposes of the first appeal, it is difficult to see how they have somehow because defense counsel raised it on remand. not so. at resentencing, defense counsel did not argue that one strike sentencing was inapplicable to counts 1, 3, and 4 because sinohue was qualified for probation. the defense sentencing memorandum addressed count 5, and count 5 only. defense counsel argued in the memorandum that sinohue was on count 5 mr. sinohue will not be granted probation on count 5 or a concurrent sentence with count 2 on count 5 then he should be sentenced to the low term of 6 years on count 5the hearing: the court and parties discussed resentencing as to count 5 only. contrary to section 288, subdivision section defense counsel did not, at any point, suggest that any other count applicability of the one strike law. sinohue points out that a trial court may reconsider the entire sentence when a case is remanded for resentencing on a single count. (see people v. burbine (2003) 106 cal.ato reconsider an entire sentencing structure in multicount cases where a portion of the originpeople v. begnaud (1991) 235 cal.app.3d 1548, 1552; people v. hill (1986) 185 cal.app.3d 831, 834.) but this precept does not assist sinohue. here, we did not vacate any portion of tdirections, after a judgment on appeal, the trial court has jurisdiction only to follow the directions of the appellate court; it cannot modify, or add to, those directi[citation.]people v. vizcarra (2015) 236 cal.app.4th 422, 441-443 [rejecting claim full sentencing analysison remand when appellate court reversed sentence on one count].) in any event, here the 10 trial court did not choose to reconsider the entire sentence, or any other count; the sentences on counts 1 through 4 remained unchanged. (ii) the trial court did not refuse to make findings on probation eligibility in any event, sinntentions fail on the merits. sinohue contends the trial section 1203.066, subdivision (c)(1) through (5), and therefore failed to consider his eligibility for probation, thereby depriving him of due process. he is incorrect. the defense sentencing memorandum argued sinohue was eligible for probation on count 5 because he satisfied each of the five criteria listed in section 1203.066, subdivision (c). the probation report, which was attached to the sentencing memorandum, also addressed several of the section 1203.066, subdivision (c) criteria, but concluded sinohue was ineligible for probation. the trial court stated it had received and reviewed the defense sentencing memorandum. at the sentencing hearing, defense counsel asked the trial court to expressly state whether it found sinohue qualified for probation under section 1203.066. the court replied, it out of the sthus, it is clear the trial court was aware it could grant probation if the requisites of section 1203.066, subdivision (c) were satisfied; did consider the five section 1203.066, subdivision (c) criteria; and determined sinohue did not satisfy one or more of them. is based on a misreading of the record. he interprets makinbut the cited comments did not suggest the court was refusing to consider whether section 1203.066 applied. instead, using the language of the statute that paragraphs 7 through 9 did not apply when the court makes all of the following findings the court simply indicated it found sinohue failed to satisfy the five section 1203.066, subdivision (c) criteria. in short, the court found sinohue was statutorily ineligible for probation, and declined to make the findings required by section 1203.066, subdivision (c)(1) through (5), to bring him within the statutory exception. (see people v. groomes, supra, 14 cal.app.4th at 11 p. 87.) the colloquy between the court and defense counsel, which we quote in the margin, illustrates this point.5 to the extent sinohue complains that the trial court erred by failing to specify which of the five criteria had not been met, or further describe the basis for its ruling, any challenge has been forfeited. party in a criminal case may not, on claims involving s failure to properly make or articulate its diif the party did not object to the sentence at trial. [citation.] the rule applies to cases in which the stated reasons allegedly do not apply to the particular case, and cases in which the court purportedly erred because it double-counted a particular sentencing factor, misweighed the various factors, or failed to state any reasons or give a sufficient number of valid reasons (people v. scott (2015) 61 cal.4th 363, 406, italics added; people v. boyce (2014) 59 cal.4th 672, 730-731; people v. gonzalez (2003) 31 cal.4th 745, 751; people v. scott (1994) 9 cal.4th 331, 356.) as our recitation of the colloquy between the court and defense counsel 5 if [probation] was denied, to make any f well, i guess you could make the findings, and he would [be] eligible for probation, and it would be up to you if you gave it to him. that would be under the 1998 version.

[] . . . [] thank you very much for your co 12 demonstrates, when the trial court suggested it had already stated the reasons why probation would be denied, defense counsel indicated further clarification was unnecessary. (iii) the trial court did not abuse its discretion by finding sinohue was statutorily ineligible for probation under section 1203.066 for probation under section 1203.066 or explain the basis for its findings, any error was provisions of section 1203.066, subdivision (c). (see people v. lammey, supra, 216 cal.app.3d at pp. 94-95; cf. people v. mclaughlin (1988) 203 cal.app.3d 1037, 1040.) in count 1, sinohue was convicted of committing a lewd act on victim d.l. in november 2008. as noted, in 2006 the legislature amended section 667.61 to make violation of section 288, subdivision (a), a one strike offense without regard to whether the defendant was qualified for probation under section 1203.066. (see stats. 2006, ch. 337,  33.) thus, whether or not sinohue was qualified for probation, his crime in ffense. moreover, sinohue failed to offer any evidence whatsoever showing that a grant of probation would be in victim d.l.he therefore failed to meet his burden to establish the existence of all the criteria under section 1203.066, subdivision (c). (people v. groomes, supra, 14 cal.app.4th at p. 89; people v. lammey, supra, 216 cal.app.3d at p. 98.) in counts 3 and 4, sinohue was convicted of committing lewd acts on victim j.k. during the summer of 1998. again, sinohue failed to present sufficient evidence to support a finding that a grant of probation would be in the best interests of the child. the people argue that under people v. wills (2008) 160 cal.app.4th 728, sinohue could not prove the best interest criterion as to victim j.k. because j.k. was an adult at the time of trial. in wills, under former section 1203.066, subdivision (c) a sentencing court has no authority to grant probation to a defendant . . . in a case in which the molestation victim is no longer a child at the time of sentencing. 13 (id. at p. 732.) the court reasoned that, based on the plain language of section 1203.066, a sentencing court is unable to make a finding that a grant of probation is in the best or the simple reason that there is no child. in such a case, the sentencing court is uof section 1203.066, as required by that subdivision, and thus is not authorized to grant probatipeople v. wills, supra, at pp. 737-738.) sinohue contends that wills was wrongly decided and invites this court not to follow it. we decline the invitation. but, apart from wills, the fact remains that sinohue did not present sufficient evidence from which the trial court could have concluded probation was in the best interest of j.k. on remand, in his sentencing memorandum, sinohue argued that j.k. stated, at the original sentencing hearing, that e defense counsel made the same argument at the hearing and added that j.k. had been undergoing therapy. based on this, sinohue argued a grant of pr interest. this conclusion does not follow from the argument and evidencehat j.k. was undergoing therapy,6 understood sinohue suffers from a sickness, and has not forgiven him does not constitute any t interest to grant probation. sinohue failed to meet his burden to satisfy the requirements of section 1203.066, subdivision (c), and thus could not have been found qualified for probation.7 (see people v. wutzke, supra, 28 cal.4th at p. 932.) 6 the defense presented no evidence to show j.k. was participating in therapy, but 7 indeed, the only evidence before the trial court suggested that probation was clearly not iwas not in the best interests of the victims. at the initial sentencing hearing do not remotely indicate he believed granting probation would be in his or d.l. bt that 14 seriously mischaracterizes the record. the trial court never precluded sinohue from presenting evidence at the resentencing hearing. sinohue never sought an evidentiary hearing and never sought to produce evidence on the probation eligibility question. 2. dual use of facts sinohue next asserts that the trial court violated the prohibition on dual use of facts by relying on a factor that was an element of the charged offense to impose the high term on count 5. he avers that this purported error was a violation of due process, and the matter must be remanded for resentencing. we disagree. the trial court explained its selection of the high term as follows: took advantage of a position of trust for both victims in molesting them. and it was very apparent from . . . the trial and the testimony he damaged the victims and tore apart their families . . . . he carried out the offenses with careful planning and calculation over a lengthy period of time, which is very clear from the evidence. the victims were of young age, obviously, and were particularly vulnerable, and he took advantage of that. they were actually put into his care a number of times, and he took advantage again of that position of t as the people point out, sinohue has forfeited his claim that the trial court violated the proscription on dual use of facts because he made no objection on this ground below. (see people v. scott, supra, 9 cal.4th at p. 356.) however, because sinohue contends his and he had hurt d.l. and j.k. as well as many others. nothing about the comments made at sentencing supported a finding probation would have been in the best interests. 15 counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to object, we consider the merits of his contention. terms referred to in section 1170(b), the sentencing judge may consider circumstances in aggravation or mitigation, and any other factor reasonably related to the sentencing decision. the relevant circumstances may be obtained from the case record, the aggravation o (cal. rules of court, rule 4.420(b).) a trial court has broad discretion in selecting the appropriate sentence, and we review its decision for abuse. a trial court abuses its discretion when its decision is irrational or arbitrary, or when the court relies on circumstances that are irrelevant to the decision or otherwise constitute an improper basis for the decision. (people v. sandoval (2007) 41 cal.4th 825, 847; people v. carmony (2004) 33 cal.4th 367, 377.) the burden is on the party attacking the sentence to clearly show the sentencing decision was irrational or arbitrary. (people v. carmony, at p. 376; people v. jones (2009) 178 cal.app.4th 853, 861.) although a single fact may be relevant to more than one sentencing choice, the dual or overlapping use of sentencing factors is prohibited in a variety of circumstances. (people v. scott, supra, 9 cal.4th at p. 350; people v. moberly (2009) 176 cal.app.4th 1191, 1197.) a fact that is an element of a crime upon which sentence is imposed may not be used to impose a greater term. (people v. scott, at p. 350; people v. moberly, at p. 1197; cal. rules of court, rule 4.420(d).) sinohue contends that since an element of section 288.5 is that the victim is under aggravating factor, at least to the extent the vulnerability finding was based upon their ages. (see, e.g., people v. quintanilla (2009) 170 cal.app.4th 406, 413; people v. alvarado (2001) 87 cal.app.4th 178, 195 s age is an element of the offense, ths vulnerability due to being 16 that age as a reaso people v. flores (1981) 115 cal.app.3d 924, 927.) . instead, the court found the victims were vulnerable because, in addition to their ages, they had been abuse his position of trust. when the record reveals circumstances in addition to age that made a victim particularly vulnerable, there is no improper dual use of facts. (people v. alvarado, supra, 87 cal.app.4th at p. 195.) in regard to an argument similar to quintanilla youth as part of its vulnerability and abuse of trust rationale: defendant exploited the cordial relationship he had built up over years, as a friendly neighbor and father of [the here was nothing improper in finding such actions to be an aggravating factorpeople v. quintanilla, supra, 170 cal.app.4th at p. 413; see also people v. alvarado, at p. 195 [the victim was not only 81 years old, but also lived alone; tcould reasonably, and properly, rely on the combination of these facts to find that the victim was particularly vulnerable]; people v. estrada (1986) 176 cal.app.3d 410, 418 [trial court did not err by imposing an aggravated term based on victim vulnerability even though the victims minority was an element of the offense; she was not only young, but was shy, withdrawn, and small in stature]; cf. people v. flores, supra, 115 cal.app.3d at p. 927 [tor where ].) moreover, even if the trial court had erred, sinohue has failed to show any prejudice. it is settled that imposition of the upper term may be based upon a single aggravating factor. (people v. black (2007) 41 cal.4th 799, 815; people v. osband (1996) 13 cal.4th 622, 728; people v. jones, supra, 178 cal.app.4th at p. 863, fn. 7; people v. quintanilla, supra, 170 cal.app.4th at p. 413.) in addition to the vulnerability s were calculated and planned over time. (see cal. rules of court, rule 4.421(a)(8) & (11).) 17 thus, even absent vulnerability, the facts supported imposition of the upper term on count 5. because sinohue cannot show prejudice, his contention that defense counsel provided ineffective assistance fails. (see people v. homick (2012) 55 cal.4th 816, 893, fn. 44 [to establish ineffective assistance, a defendant must show s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and there is a reasonable probability s errors, a more favorable determination would have resulted; if the defendant makes an insufficient showing on either component, the claim fails].) sinohue argues that, had the trial court realized it could not rely on the vulnerability factor, it might have imposed a lesser term, and therefore remand is required disagree. as explained in alvarado remand would be unnecessary even if it were s age. given the numerous other circumstances that rendered her vulnerable, we do not find it reasonably probable the court would reach a different conclusion in finding the victim vulnerable or imposing an people v. alvarado, supra, 87 cal.app.4th at pp. 195-196; people v. osband, supra, 13 cal.4th at p. 728 [improper dual use of facts does not necessitate resentencing if it is not reasonably probable that a more favorable sentence would have been imposed in the absence of the error].) the same is true here. 3. custody credits the parties agree that the custody credits, and suggest a limited remand to the trial court for this purpose is appropriate. we agree that the trial court should have made the calculation, but conclude the omission can be more expeditiously cured by modification of the abstract of judgment rather than remand. at the resentencing hearing the trial court stated that from the date of the prior sentencing until the date of the resentencing, sinohue had accrued 1,550 days of actual custody credit. defense counsel observed that sinohue had been in custody since the date of his arrest, december 8, 2009, and his actual custody credits, from the date of his arrest to the date of resentencing, were 1,834 days. the trial court, on the other hand, 18 calculated that sinohue was entitled to 2,200 actual days from the date of arrest until resentencing. the court opined that t . . . the trial court stated calculations as is, for now, meaning, apparently, it intended to leave unchanged the credit calculation applicable at the original sentencing. the abstract of judgment prepared upon resentencing stated the same calculation of actual and presentence custody credits as had the original abstract: 650 actual days and 98 days of local conduct credit, for a total of 748 days. people v. buckhalter (2001) 26 cal.4th 20, considered whether, when a matter is remanded for resentencing, the trial court must recalculate custody and conduct credits. (id. at p. 23.) the court concluded: when, as here, an appellate remand results in modification of a felony sentence during the term of imprisonment, the trial court must calculate the actual time the defendant has already served and credit that time against the [citation.] on the other hand, a convicted felon once sentenced, committed, and delivered to prison is not restored to presentence status, for purposes of the sentence-credit statutes, by virtue of a limited appellate remand for correction of sentencing errors.

(ibid.) good behavand credit the actual time defendant served on his sentence prior to its modification. (ibid.) applying buckhalter ys of actual custody served prior to resentencing. sinohue avers he has accrued a total of 1,835 actual days in custody. this calculation appears correct. sinohue had been in custody since the date of his arrest on december 8, 2009. initial sentencing transpired on 19 september 19, 2011. sinohue was resentenced on december 16, 2014. based upon these dates, sinohue was entitled to 24 days for 2009, 365 days for 2010, 365 days for 2011, 366 days for 2012 (a leap year), 365 days for 2013, and 350 days for 2014, for a total of 1,835 days.8 (see people v. rajanayagam (2012) 211 cal.app.4th 42, 48 [calculation of custody credit begins on the date of arrest and continues through the date of sentencing].) credit is unauthorized and may people v. taylor (2004) 119 cal.app.4th 628, 647.) accordingly, we order the judgment modified to reflect the correct credit calculation. 4. correction of abstract of judgment the people request correction of errors in the abstract of judgment. at sentencing, the trial court orally imposed a determinate, 16-year term on count 5, consecutive to the indeterminate term imposed on count 2. the abstract of judgment, however, indicates a sentence of 16 years to life on count 5, to be served concurrently with count 2. while not raised by the parties, we also observe that the abstract of judgment erroneously states all the crimes were committed in 2008. it is well settled thabstract of judgment is not the judgment of conviction; it does not control if s oral judgment and may not add to or modify the judgment it purports to digest or summarize. [citation.] when an abstract of judgment does not reflect the actual sents verbal pronouncement, this court has the inherent power to correct such clerical error on appeal, whether on our own motion or upon application of the parties.people v. jones (2012) 54 cal.4th 1, 89; people v. mitchell (2001) 26 cal.4th 181, 185; people v. walz (2008) 160 cal.app.4th 1364, 1367, fn. 3.) we therefore order that the abstract of 8 sinohue correctly points out that the original abstract of judgment incorrectly stated he was entitled to 650 days of actual credit and 98 days of presentence conduct credit, whereas the correct calculation was 651 days of actual credit and 97 days of presentence conduct credit. (see people v. valenti (2016) 243 cal.app.4th 1140, 1184 [sections 288.5 and 288, subdivision (a) are violent felonies subject to a 15 percent conduct credit limitation].) we agree, and order the presentence conduct credit amount corrected accordingly. 20 judgment be corrected to conform to the actual sentence imposed by the trial court on count 5, namely, a determinate term of 16 years, consecutive to count 2. the abstract should also reflect the years of the crimes as follows: count 1, 2008; count 2, 2008-2009; count 3, 1998; count 4, 1998; and count 5, 1998-1999. disposition the judgment is modified to reflect a determinate sentence of 16 years on count 5, to be served consecutive to the sentence imposed on count 2, and 1,835 days of actual custody credit and 97 days of presentence conduct credit. the clerk of the superior court is directed to prepare an amended abstract of judgment reflecting these changes as well as corrections to the dates of the offenses, as set forth herein, and to forward a copy to the department of corrections and rehabilitation. in all other respects, the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports aldrich, j. we concur: edmon, p. j. lavin, j.
