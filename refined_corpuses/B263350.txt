(f).)1 proposition 36 does not specifically define the meaning of the quoted phrase. electorate approved the safe neighborhoods and schools act, commonly referred to as proposition 47. proposition 47 specifically will commit a new violent felony within the meaning of certain enumerated penal code provisions. ( 1170.18, subd. (c).) on appeal, definition applies to petitions filed under proposition 36, and that the trial court erred in failing to exercise its discretion in accordance with this standard. we disagree, and conclude propositiapplies only to petitions filed under proposition 47. we also conclude the trial court reasonably exercised its discretion in accordance with the standard applicable to proposition 36. we affirm. 1 all future undesignated statutory references are to the penal code. 3 facts and procedureal background on january 8, 1998, a jury convicted rocha of selling, transporting or offering to sell a controlled substance and possessing a controlled substance for sale. he admitted suffering two prior convictions for first degree burglary, both serious felonies under the three strikes law. on february 4, 1998, the court sentenced rocha to 25 years to life in state prison. on april 26, 2013, rocha filed a petition for recall and resentencing pursuant to proposition 36, the three strikes reform act. on july 26, 2013, the trial court found rocha made a prima facie showing of eligibility and issued an order to show cause why the petition should not be granted. the people opposed the petition, alleging rocha was unsuitable for resentencing because his release would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. the people based their opposition on criminal history and disciplinary record while incarcerated. on january 12, 2015, and february 5, 2015, the court held resentencing. rocha maintained his criminal history was remote and consisted solely of nonviolent property crimes driven by his drug addiction. the largely nonviolent and that his convictions were remote, noting the commitment offense was more than 14 years old and the other convictions were more than 26 years old. nevertheless, the court found convictions carried a substantial prison term, meaning that he spent much of the time that separated his convictions in prison rather than in 4 the evidence also showed rocha received five serious rules violations reports during his 18 years of incarceration. these included possession of artwork containing a gang-related symbol in 2014; possession of gang-related contraband, specifically a possession of inmate-manufactured alcohol in 2004; possession of heroin for sale in 2003; and participation in a riot in 2001. rocha also was validated as an associate of the mexican mafia in 2008, based on an address book and letters evidencing the association, and he was revalidated in 2014, based on his possession of artwork containing a gang-related symbol and the kite. at the hearing, the people and rocha presented opposing opinions from their respective gang-validation experts as to whether rocha posed an unreasonable risk to public safety. while in custody, rocha earned a general educational management; he trained in landscape gardening and welding vocational programs; and he participated in self-help programs, including alcoholics anonymous (aa) and narcotics anonymous (na). if released, rocha testified he would reside either with his daughter or in transitional housing. he also said he would continue to participate in aa and na. with respect to job opportunities, rocha referred to a lifelong friend who had offered to train him at her mortgage company. he also suggested he could reinstate the x-ray technician license he held before he was incarcerated. the trial court denied the petition, concluding rocha would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to the public if resentenced. with respect to the applicable legal standard, the court observed that proposition 36 (section 1170.126) does not define 5 proposition 47 (section 1170.18, subdivision (c)) specifically defined the phrase, the court held that definition was not applicable to a proposition 36 petitionhistory, institutional misconduct, limited rehabilitative programming, gang validation, and undeveloped post-release plans, the court found rocha posed an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. discussion 1. statutory interpretation principles rocha contends the trial court abused its discretion by failing to assess his proposition 36 recall petition applying the court to interpret penal code provisions enacted by voter initiatives which are subject to the same rules of construction that govern statutory interpretation. (people v. rizo (2000) 22 most reliable indicator of legislative i (people v. leal analyses and arguments contained in the official ballot rizo, at p. 685.) 2. proposition 36 prior to its amendment by proposition 36, the three strikes law required that a defendant who had two or more prior convictions of violent or serious felonies receive a third strike sentence of a minimum of 25 years to life for any current felony 6 violent. (former  667, subds. (d), (e)(2)(a), 1170.12, subds. (b), (c)(2)(a).) proposition 36 amended the three strikes law with er serious nor violent. in that circumstance, unless an exception applies, the defendant is to receive a second strike sentence of twice the term otherwise provided for the current felony. (people v. johnson (2015) 61 cal.4th 674, 680, 681.) proposition 36 also created a post-conviction release proceeding whereby a qualified prisoner, serving a three strikes sentence for a felony that is neither serious nor violent may have his or her sentence recalled and be sentenced as a second strike offender unless the court determines that resentencing would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. (people v. yearwood (2013) 213 cal.app.4th 161, 168.) wever, enumerate a including the type of crimes committed, the extent of injury to victims, the length of prior prison commitments, and the record and record of rehabilitation while incarcerated; and [] (3) any other evidence the court, within its discretion, determines to be relevant in deciding whether a new sentence would result in an unreasonable risk o 1170.126, subd. (g).) proposition 36 became effective on november 7, 2012. (see people v. brown (2014) 230 cal.app.4th 1502, 1507.) under section 1170.126, a petition for resentencing must be filed within 7 sho 1170.126, subd. (b).) 3. proposition 47 california voters enacted proposition 47 on november 4, 2014. it went into effect the next day. (cal. const., art. ii,  10, subd. (a).) proposition 47 reduced certain selected felonies to misdemeanors. like proposition 36, it created a new resentencing provision whereby a person convicted of and serving a sentence for a felony or felonies which were now misdemeanors under proposition 47 may petition for a recall of sentence and sentence shall be recalled and the petitioner resentenced to a misdemeanor . . . unless the court, in its discretion, determines that resentencing the petitioner would pose an unreasonable risk like proposition 36, proposition 47 enumerates the same list of factors that the court may consider in making its discretionary risk of danger determinationcrimes committed, the extent of injury to victims, the length of prior prison commitments, and the remoteness of the crimes.

(c).) the enumerated offenses are 4. to proposition 36 meaning of that phrase as used in proposition 36.2 he argues this conclusion is compelled by the words of the statute, which petitioner will commit a new violent (c)throu 2 this issue is currently pending before the supreme court.

(f)). the people argue is ambiguous, and they cite two apparent inconsistencies within the text of section 1170.18 to make the case. first, they note the definition in section 1170.18, subdivision (c) is limited unreasonable risk that the petitioner will commitsuper strike. section 1170.18, subdivision (a), as the statute does not refer to any other kind of petition. additionally, the people emphasize definition throughout the penal code would conflict with the express directive set forth in section 1170.18, subdivision (n). sections is intended to diminish or abrogate the finality of judgments in any case not falling within the purview of this act ( 1170.18, subd. (n), italics added.) if a court ruling on a proposition 36 petition must grant the petition unless it finds an unreasonable risk the petitioner will commit a super strike under the restrictive definition provided in section 1170.18, subdivision (c), the people maintain the finality of the underlying judgment will be [fall] within the d. (n).) uous, we find the apparent inconsistencies identified by the people do indicate the electorate may have erroneously used the word 10 3 although courts are reluctant to simply rewrite an initiative, there is precedent appropriate circumstances. our supreme court explained the principle in people v. skinner: construction which mandates that courts, in construing a measure, not undertake to rewrite its unambiguous language. [citation.] that rule is not applied, however, when it appears clear that a word has been erroneously used, and a judicial correction will best carry out the intent of the adopting body. . . . whether the use of [a particular word] is, in fact, a drafting error 3 similar language have been construed as unambiguously referring to the entire code in which such statutes appeared. for instance, in marshall v. pasadena unified school dist. (2004) 119 cal.app.4th 1241, the court considered a provision in the public contract co as used in this code. marshall, at p. 1255, italics omitted.) the marshall ibidlegislaparticular chapter, article or division of the public contract codemarshall, at p. 1255.) thus, the marshall court reasoibid.; see also people v. bucchierre (1943) 57 cal.app.2d 153, 166 182, referred to the penal code]; cf. people v. vasquez (1992) 7 cal.app.4th 763, 766-as used in this title penal code].) 11 can only be determined by reference to the purpose of the section people v. skinner (1985) 39 cal.3d 765, 775-776.) for the reasons that follow, we 1170.18, subdivision (c) was a drafting error properly subject to judicial correction. indication that the drafters and electorate erroneously ion is used throughout proposition 47 to refer to persons petitioning (see  1170.18, subds. (a), (b), (c), (j), (1), & (m).) intended to diminish or abrogate the finality of judgments in any case not falling within the purview of this actics added.) unless subdivision is limited to proposition 36 would most certainly be diminished. taken together, these provisions strongly indicate the drafters and be applied only with respect to petitions brought under proposition 47. likewise, the official title and summary, legal analysis, and arguments for and against proposition 47 nowhere suggest that proposition 47 will have an impact on proposition 36. (voter information guide, gen. elec. (nov. 4, 2014), prop. 36, analysis by legislative analyst, pp. 34-39.) the ballot materials do not, for example, say that proposition 47 will severely restrict the ability of courts to reject resentencing petitions under proposition 12 36. rather, the ballot materials emphasize that resentencing provisions will affect only those persons serving sentences for specified nonserious, nonviolent property or drug crimes. furthermore, propositions 36 and 47 have different purposes. proposition 36 is designed to reduce penalties for individuals with two or more prior serious or violent felony convictions, whose current conviction is also a felony. by contrast, proposition 47 is intended to reduce penalties for low-voter information guide, supra, prop. 36, analysis by legislative analyst, proposal, p. 35.) as discussed with respect to the ballot materials, the purpose of proposition 47 belies the notion that voters intended it to affect inmates convicted of crimes other than those property or drug crimes specified in proposition 47. lastly, proposition 47 timing is inconsistent with an intention to affect proposition 36 petitions. proposition 36 required defendants to file petitions within two years from its enactment absent a showing of good cause for a late petition. ( 1170.126, subd. (b).) proposition 47 was enacted with only two days remaining in the two-year period for filing proposition 36 petitions. a rational voter would not have understood proposition 47 to change the rules for proposition 36 petitions when the period for filing such petitions had almost expired. for the foregoing reasons, we conclude section 1170.18, subdivision (c) contains a drafting errorthe use of the word ta read as suchisk of danger 13 5. the trial court reasonably exercised its discretion to deny the petition proposition 36 vests the trial court with discretion to deny a statutorily-nes that resentencing the petitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of 1170.126, subd.

(g).) the trial court, its disturbed on appeal except on a showing that the court exercised its discretion in an arbitrary, capricious or patently absurd manner that resulted in a manifest miscarriage of justice. (people v. rodrigues (1994) 8 cal.4th 1060, 1124-1125.) exercise of discretion are subject to review for substantial evidence. (see people v. cluff (2001) 87 cal.app.4th 991, 998 [trial court abuses its discretion when factual findings critical to record in a light most favorable to the [order] to determine whether it contains substantial evidence, i.e., evidence that is credible and of solid valueconclusions.

(see, e.g., people v. hughes (2002) 27 cal.4th 287, 355 burglary laws are based primarily upon a recognition of the dangers to personal safety created by the usual burglary situationthe danger that the intruder will harm the occupants in attempting to perpetrate the intended crime or to escape and the danger that the occupants will in anger or panic react violently to the invasion, thereby inviting more violence. ; people v. villalobos (2006) 145 cal.app.4th 310, 317 [same].) indeed, the concept is codified in the three strikes law, which iolent offenses such as first degree burglary and furnishing drugs to a minor. ( 1192.7, subds. (c)(18) & (24).) likewise, proposition 36 disqualifies persons convicted of certain narcotics offenses from eligibility for resentencing. (see  1170.126, subd. (e)(2); 667, subd. (e)(2)(c)(i); 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(c)(i).) moreover, although the ballot materials concerning proposition 36 focused on violent criminals, section 7 of the three strikes reform act provides: c power of the people of the state of california for the protection of the health, safety, and welfare of the people of the state of california, and shall be (voter information guide, gen. elec.
