people v. wheeler (1978) 22 cal.3d 258. 2 all further undesignated statutory references are to the penal code. 3 in his opening brief, genel raised an additional claim that the trial court erred by denying his suppression motion. however, in his reply brief, he withdraws this contention. 3 genel was hallucinating, that issaying that he sees things that denegal assembled a team of parole agents and arranged for the shalong with parole agents eric borba, tina rivero, and cesar melendez, denegal travelled to the west simmons avenue address to arrest genel. and back. upon arrival at the house at approximately 5:00 p.m.learned genel was in the garage. borba entered the garage first, with his firearm drawn. he state parole poli genel was standing in the garage, holding a rake and a wrench. the rake handle was towards the ground, and it appeared genel was using the wrench to manipulate the rake. borba ordered genel to drop the items, and genel complied. the other three agents entered the garage immediately after borba. after dropping the rake and wrench, genel placed his hands into his pants pockets. concerned that genel might have a weapon, borba told genel to remove his hands from his pockets [a]ly. according to borba, genel appeared confused and worried; according to denegal, he appeared frustrated. from his pocket, revealing that genel had a potato peeler in his hand. borba moved behind genel, while melendez grabbed his left arm and rivero grabbed his right. the agents continued to command genel to remove his right hand from his pocket, but he from his right pocket, genel was holding a small knife. he failed to heed her order to drop it. instead, he swung his arm back and forth in a horizontal motion, making the knife come within five 4 inches of causing genel and all four parole agents to fall to the ground. when the agents attempted to handcuff genel, he clenched his fists and locked his arms and elbows. after genel person. genel was wearing two pairs of pants. in the pocket of the first pants layer was another small knife. during the incident, genel stated that he was not on parole. he asked, he also stated ight knee was sore and his pants were ripped. rs knees and elbows were scraped and her foot was twisted, necessitating a hospital visit. melendez b. defense evidence genel testified in his own behalf. denegal became his parole officer in october 2014. genel lived at the west simmons avenue address, in the garage, in 2014 and 2015, and denegal had visited him there. at some point denegal told genel that a neighbor was complaining about the condition of the yard. denegal told genel he needed to maintain the yard, and genel signed a paper agreeing to do so. thereafter, he cleaned the yard and pruned the trees. genel was told by a parole agent that his parole would terminate in march of 2015. therefore, he ceased reporting. when the parole agents arrived on april 1, 2015, he was fixing the rake so he could clean the yard. he was using the potato peeler and the small knife to strip splinters from the wooden handle. there was also a loose screw, making the 5 rake wobble, and he was using the wrench to tighten it. the other knife was a pumpkin cutter. when the agents entered the garage he was surprised. he complied with their orders by emptying his pockets onto the floor, including the knives and the potato peeler, and dropping the wrench and the rake. he did not wave the knife around. however, the agents forced him to the floor. denegal placed a knee on his neck and pushed his head into the floor, causing him to bleed. he struggled only because he was in pain when his head was pressed against the floor and the of sweatpants in order to protect the sweatpants, in which he slept. 2. procedure a jury convicted genel of two counts of carrying a concealed dirk or dagger ( 21310) and misdemeanor obstructing a peace officer, officer borba ( 148, subd. (a)(1)), a lesser included offense of the charged crime of resisting an executive officer ( 69). it acquitted genel of assault with a deadly weapon upon a peace officer ( 245, subd. (c), officer rivero). genel admitted serving two prior prison terms within the meaning of section 667.5, subdivision (b). the trial court sentenced genel to two years in jail, with credit for 502 days in custody. eight months of his sentence was suspended and deemed a period of mandatory supervision ( 1170, subd. (h)(5)(b)). the trial court imposed a restitution fine, a suspended probation revocation restitution fine, a criminal conviction assessment, and a court operations assessment. genel appeals. 6 discussion 1. batson/wheeler motion genel, who is apparently hispanic, contends the prosecutor exercised peremptory challenges against three hispanic prospective jurors based on their ethnicity in violation of batson and wheeler, and the trial court erred in denying his objections to these challenges.4 we disagree. a. background at the start of jury selection, a panel of 35 jurors was sworn. prospective juror no. 9 (4287) was a sterile processing technician who prepared instrumentation for surgery. she lived with her husband, a telecommunications contractor. she had no jury experience. prospective juror no. 9 confirmed, in response ssue with the defendant not testifying. the prosecutor did not question her individually. prospective juror no. 17 (4447) was a former payroll clerk who was on permanent disability. he lived by himself, and had no jury experience. neither the prosecutor nor defense counsel questioned him individually. prospective juror no. 20 (8055) was employed as a line technician for a telecommunications company. he lived with his three children aged 24, 21, and 18. one of his children also worked in the telecommunications field. he had no jury experience. when asked by defense counsel, prospective juror 4 app-section of sacramento c counsel advised at oral argument that the reference to sacramento county was a typographical error. 7 choice not to testify. when defense counsel asked, think about the fact that thesprospective juror no. 20 replied, we have to hear what happened on april 15th [sic the prosecutor asked whether prospective juror no. 20 ilty vote if you find that the defendant is guilty? and he replied that [n]o the prosecutor exercised her first and second peremptory challenges5 against two prospective jurors who, as far as the record shows, were not hispanic. she exercised her third, fourth, and fifth peremptory challenges against prospective juror nos. 17, 9, and 20, respectivelyher fifth peremptory challenge, defense counsel brought a batson/wheeler fifth peremptories were exercised against hispanic prospective jurors. it appeared to defense counsel that no hispanics remained among the 12 seated in the jury box. counsel pointed out that neither he nor the prosecutor had questioned prospective juror no. 9. the trial court stated it could not determine the ethnicity of the three prospective jurors in question, although they had hispanic surnames. prospective juror no. 17 appeared to the court to be hispanic, but prospective juror no. 20 did not. the now certain people who have surnames who 5 another hispanic prospective juror, no. 15, was removed for cause, without objection from the defense, after she explained by law enforcement officers. 8 are not the race that their surname might suggest[ the court observed, based upon some of the impressions i have of the peop it acknowlwith one, and even accepting as true that the last three have i can think of some reasons in my own mind for why at least two of them have been the court then stated it would give the prosecutor a chance to address the issue. the prosecle out based on their race. and actually i think the juror in seat checked any of their names. [] the reasons why i kicked out those people were, i had bad nonverbal vibes from . nothing to do with their race. the trial court stated that prospective juror no. 17 ed to have a little bit of a language difficulty. although ive. but i think he did have a little bi denied the motion. subsequently, the prosecutor exercised peremptory challenges to an additional three prospective jurors, without objection. b. analysis our california supreme court recently reiterated the parameters governing batson/wheeler motions. s use of peremptory challenges to exclude prospective jurors based on race or ethnicity violates both the equal protection clause of the united states constitution and the right to trial by a jury 9 drawn from a representative cross-section of the community under article i, section 16 of the california constitution. (people v. parker (2017) 2 cal.5th 1184, 1210-1211; people v. gutierrez (2017) 2 cal.5th 1150, 1157-1158.) exclusion of even a single prospective juror for such impermissible reasons is structural error requiring reversal. (gutierrez, at p. 1158.) a prima facie case of discrimination based on race or ethnicity in the use of peremptory challenges is established if the totality of the relevant facts gives rise to an inference of discriminatory purpose. (people v. thomas (2012) 53 cal.4th 771, 793; people v. gutierrez, supra, 2 cal.5th at p. 1158; people v. jones (2017) 7 cal.app.5th 787, 802.) presumption that a peremptory challenge is being exercised properly, and the burden is on the opposing party to demonstrate impermissible -step procedure applies at trial when a defendant alleges discriminatory use of peremptory challenges. first, the defendant must make a prima facie showing that the prosecution exercised a challenge based on impermissible criteria. second, if the trial court finds a prima facie case, then the prosecution must offer nondiscriminatory reasons for the challenge. third, the trial court must determine whether the prosecutionjustification is credible and whether, in light of all relevant circumstances, the defendant has shown purposeful race discrimination. [citation.] regarding [discriminatory] motivation rests with, and never speople v. parker, supra, 2 cal.5th at p. 1211.) unless a trial court applies the wrong standard, trial wheeler motion is reviewed for substantial 10 evidence.

[citation.] among these are that a party has struck most or all of the members of the identified group from the venire, that a party has used a disproportionate number of strikes against the group, that the party has failed to engage these jurors in more than desultory voir dire, that the defendant is a member of the identified group, and that the victim is a member of the group to which the majority of the remaining jurors belong. [citation.] a court may also consider nondiscriminatory reasons for a peremptory challeclearly in the record [citations] and that necessarily dispel people v. scott, supra, 61 cal.4th at p. 384; people v. bonilla, supra, 41 cal.4th at p. 342; people v. jones, supra, 7 cal.app.5th at p. 802.) here, the trial court did not explicitly or implicitly rule -stage ruling, that is, whether genel established a prima facie case, without regard to the ons. (see people v. sattiewhite, supra, 59 cal.4th at pp. 469-470.) sthat genel failed to establish a prima facie showing. juror on the basis of race or ethnicity is an error of constitutional 12 showing is not made merely by establishing that an excluded juror was a an inference of discrimination from the fact one party has finding a prima facie case is necessarily relying on an apparent pattern ibe difficult to discern when the number of challenges is extremely (people v. jones, supra, 7 cal.app.5th at p. 803; people v. bonilla, supra, 41 cal.4th at p. 343, fn. 12.) our hile no prospective juror may be struck on improper grounds, we have practical matter, to draw the requisite inference where only a few members of a cognizable group have been excused and no indelible pattern of discrimination appears.people v. garcia (2011) 52 cal.4th 706, 747.) thus, courts have repeatedly found no prima facie case based solely upoagainst a few jurors. in people v. farnam (2002) 28 cal.4th 107, for example, the prosecutor exercised four of his first five peremptory challenges against african-american prospective jurors, and a small minority of jurors on the panel were african-american. (id. at p 136.) nonetheless, these circumstances fell id. at p. 137.) in people v. hoyos (2007) 41 cal.4th 872, disapproved on other grounds in people v. black (2014) 58 cal.4th 912, 919-920, no prima facie case was found although the prosecutor used peremptory challenges to strike three of the only four hispanics on the panel, and the defendant was also hispanic. the court reasoned, all members of a particular 13 group may establish a prima facie discrimination case, especially if the defendant belongs to the same group, this fact alone is not hoyos, at p. 901.) in people v. bell, excusal of two out of three african-american jurors did not sample makes drawing an inference of discrimination from this fact alone impossible. (people v. bell (2007) 40 cal.4th 582, 598, disapproved on other grounds by people v. sanchez (2016) 63 cal.4th 665, 686, fn. 13.) in people v. parker, supra, 2 cal.5th at pages 1212-1213, the excusal of the only two african-americans in the jury pool was insufficient to support an inference that the two were challenged because of their race. echoing the reasoning of earlier cases, the court reasoned that the small absolute size of this sample makes drawing an inference of discrimination from this fact alone impossible [a]s a practical matter . . . the challenge of one or two jurors can rarely suggest a pattern id. at p. 1212.) in people v. bonilla, supra, 41 cal.4th 313, challenges against the only two african-americans in the jury pool. (id. at pp. 342-343.) in jones, the prosecutor exercised three out of nine peremptory challenges to excuse africanamerican prospective jurors, and the defendant argued there was no apparent reason for excluding them. (people v. jones, supra, 7 cal.app.5th at p. 803.) jones use of g alone, to id. at p. 804; see generally people v. clark (2016) 63 cal.4th 522, 567.) likewise, here, the fact the prosecutor used three of eight peremptory challenges to excuse hispanic prospective jurors was insufficient to give rise to an inference of discrimination based on 14 ethnicity, given the small number of prospective jurors in question. indeed, genel conceded at oral argument that the fact three hispanic jurors were excused did not, in and of itself, give rise to a prima facie case.6 furthermore, the prosecutor opined that prospective juror no. 2 appeared to be hispanic, and this juror remained on the panel. members of the group allegedly targeted by discrimination may show under all the circumstances that no wheeler/batson violation occurred.people v. garcia, supra, 52 cal.4th at pp. 747-748; people v. cunningham (2015) 61 cal.4th 609, 664; people v. jones, supra, 7 cal.app.5th at p. 806 [fact two african-americans were ultimately seated on the jury was a circumstance iled to make a prima facie showing].) while the record does not conclusively reveal the ethnicity of the parole officers (the alleged 6 the people argue no prima facie showing was made because genel failed to show the prosecutor exercised peremptory that the trial court found only one of the challenged jurors was actually hispanic, despite the fact all three had hispanic surnames. this argument is meritless. our supreme court has we have held that spanish surnames may identify hispanic individuals, who are members of a cognizable class for purposes of batson/wheeler motions. re . . . no one knows at the time of challenge whether a particular individual who has a spanish surname is hispanic, a showing that jurors are being exclude may nonetheless constitute a prima facie case of impermissible strikes based on association with a cognizable group. [citation.] although the correlation between surname and group membership is not exact, (people v. gutierrez, supra, 2 cal.5th at p. 1156, fn. 2.) 15 victims), at least two melendez and rivero had hispanic surnames. thus it cannot be said that the victims were members of the group to which the majority of the remaining jurors belonged, a factor . it is true the prosecutor did not individually question two of the jurors at issue, but this is not a weighty consideration because the prosecutor did not extensively question the vast majority of prospective jurors. at, the were not discriminatory on their face. genel argues that the pretextual and insufficient. but, because we are examining the first-stage inquiry that is, whether a prima facie case was established ons are not at issue. (see people v. scott, supra, 61 cal.4th at p. 390; people v. jones, supra, 7 cal.app.5th at p. 804.) to the extent genel suggests comparative juror analysis was required, we disagree; comparative juror analysis is unnecessary when no prima facie case is established. (people v. clark, supra, 63 cal.4th at p. 568 first time on appeal only applies to stage three batson/wheeler people v. bonilla, supra, 41 cal.4th at p. 350.) 2. constitutionality of section 21310 as applied to genel moved to dismiss the concealed dirk or dagger counts, arguing that section 21310 was unconstitutional as applied to possession of concealed knives in his own home. the trial court denied the motion. genel here renews his argument that, as applied to him, the statute is unconstitutional in light of district of columbia v. heller (2008) 554 u.s. 570 (heller). under heller, he avers, he 16 had the constitutional right to carry concealed knives to defend himself in his home. a. section 21310 section 21310 provides: except as provided in chapter 1 (commencing with section 17700)[7] of division 2 of title 2, any person in this state who carries concealed upon the person any dirk or dagger is punishable by imprisonment in a county jail not exceeding one year or imprisonment pursuant to subdivision (h) section 16470 defines dirk or dagger. it provides: as used in this means a knife or other instrument with or without a handguard that is capable of ready use as a stabbing weapon that may inflict great bodily injury or death. a nonlocking folding knife, a folding knife that is not prohibited by section 21510, or a pocketknife is capable of ready use as a stabbing weapon that may inflict great bodily injury or death 8 section 20200 provides: openly suspended from the waist of the wearer is not concealed 7 section 16590 defines generally prohibited weapons. chapter 1 of division 2 of title 2, that is, sections 17700 through 17745, exempt from section 16590example, antique firearms and items possessed during the course of filming motion pictures. none of these exemptions are relevant here. 8 effective in 2012, the relevant statutory sections were renumbered without substantive change. section 21310 was formerly section 12020, subdivision (a)(4). section 16470 was formerly section 12020, subdivision (c)(24). (people v. mitchell (2012) 209 cal.app.4th 1364, 1369, fn. 1 (mitchell).) 17 thus, section 21310 proscribes carrying a concealed knife, but provides exceptions for a knife in a sheath that is visibly suspended from the waist, and for a non-switchblade folding or pocketknife, if the blade is not exposed and locked. (mitchell, supra, 209 cal.app.4th at p. 1371; see generally people v. castillolopez (2016) 63 cal.4th 322, 329-331.) a defendspecific intent is not an element of the offense. thus, to be guilty of violating section 21310, a defendant need not have intended to use the concealed dirk or dagger as a stabbing instrument. (people v. rubalcava (2000) 23 cal.4th 322, 325, 331-332 (rubalcava); mitchell, supra, 209 cal.app.4th at p. intentionally carry concealed upon his or her person an a[citation.] a defendant who does not know that he is carrying the weapon or that the concealed instrument may be used as a stabbing weapon is therefore not guilty of violating section rubalcava, at p. 332.) the legislative purpose in gers arising from the concealment of weaponsto protect themselves from surprise attacks. (mitchell, at p. 1371; in re george w. (1998) 68 cal.app.4th 1208, 1213.) in rubalcava, our supreme court upheld section 12020, subdivision (a) (the predecessor statute to section 21310), against vagueness and overbreadth challenges. (rubalcava, supra, 23 cal.4th at pp. 332-334.) there, while arresting the defendant, officers discovered a knife, with a dull, three-inch blade, (id. at p. 325.) rubalcava testified that he worked in an automotive repair shop, was 18 transporting tools to a friend, and brought the knife only because he kept it with his tools. (id. at p. 326.) convicted of unlawfully carrying a concealed dirk or dagger, rubalcava appealed on the ground the jury should have been instructed that the intent to use the knife as a stabbing weapon was an element of the offense. (id. at pp. 327-328.) our supreme court rejected this argument, reasoning that the plain statutory language did not require such an intent, and the legislative history indicated the legislature did not intend to require it. (id. at pp. 328-331.) the court likewise rejected without such an intent-to-use element, the statute was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. (rubalcava, supra, 23 cal.4th at p. 331.) pointing to earlier case law, rubalcava argued that without an intent-to-use requirement, the statute would sweep too broadly: it would, for example, make a felon out of a tailor who places a pair of scissors in his jacket, an auto mechanic who absentmindedly slips a utility knife in a pocket, a shopper who leaves a kitchen supply store with a newly-purchased steak knife in a pocket, or a parent who puts a knife in his or her coat to carry into a pta potluck. (ibid.) although the court found concerns do not render (ibid.) the statute contained no vague terms that were open to multiple interpretations the court previously legal conduct does not . . . make a statute unconstitutionally vague especially where, as here, the statutory language and legislative history indicate the legislature id. at p. 332.) as to the overbreadth 19 challenge, the court reasoned that a statute is overbroad only if it prohibits a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct. rubalcava overbreadth no instances where the statute actually infringes on constitutionally protected conductthink of none. even though section 12020 may seem overbroad as a matter of common sense, we will not find it unconstitutionally overbroad without some concrete impairment of constitutionally protected id. at p. 333.) the court reiterated: 12020 is not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad, we echo the concerns over the breadth of the statute raised by rubalcava. as written, section 12020, subdivisions (a) and (c)(24) may criminalize seemingly innocent conduct. consequently, the statute may invite arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement not due to any vagueness in the statutory language but due to the wide range of otherwise innocent conduct it proscrib(rubalcava, supra, 23 cal.4th at p. 333.legislature to reconsider the wisdom of its statutory ibid.; see also pp. 337-338 (conc. opn. of werdegar, j.).) b. the second amendment, heller, and mitchell the second amendment to the united states constitution provides: a well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear (u.s. const., 2d amend.) in heller, the high court concluded that the second amendment protects the individual right to keep and bear arms, that is, unconnected with service in a militia. (heller, 20 supra, 554 u.s. at pp. 592-593, 595.) there, a district of columbia statute imposed a complete ban on handgun possession in the home, and required that any firearm lawfully in the home be disassembled or bound by a trigger lock, rendering it inoperable. (id. at p. 628.) a police officer who wished to keep a handgun in his home challenged the constitutionality of the law. after an in-depth analysis of the history of the second amendment, justice scalia, writing for the majority, concluded that the second amendment codified the pre-existing right of individuals to possess and carry weapons for self-defense. (id. at pp. 592, 599.) the district of columbia statute at issue was constitutionally flawed because it prohibited an entire class of arms, overwhelmingly chosen by society for self-defense, in a location the home where the need for self-defense was most acute. (heller, at pp. 628-629, 635.) the inoperability requirement made it impossible for a person to use the weapon -id. at p. 630.) however, the court was careful to note that the right to bear arms in self-defense was not unlimited. (heller, supra, 554 u.s. any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose, and some measures regulating handguns are permissible. (id. at pp. 626-627, 636.) heller observed that prohibitions on carrying concealed weapons had generally been held lawful (id. at p. 626), and cautioned that its ruling did not cast doubt on presumptively lawful, standing prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions (id. at 21 pp. 626-627 & fn. 26.) accordingly, the court held, [a]ssuming that heller is not disqualified from the exercise of second register his handgun and issue him a license to carry it in the home. (id. at p. 635.) two years after heller, the high court held that the right to necessary to our system of ordered liberty. (mcdonald v. chicago (2010) 561 u.s. 742, 750, 778.) the second amendment right to possess a handgun in the home for self-defense is incorporated into the due process clause, and is thereby fully applicable to the states. (id. at p. 750; see people v. delacy (2011) 192 cal.app.4th 1481, 1487; peruta v. county of san diego (9th cir. 2016) 824 f.3d 919, 928-929 (en banc).) subsequently, california courts have rejected a number of heller-based challenges to state laws prohibiting carrying concealed weapons. (people v. ellison (2011) 196 cal.app.4th 1342, 1346-1351 [former section 12025, prohibiting carrying a concealed weapon in a vehicle, did not violate the second amendment]; people v. yarbrough (2008) 169 cal.app.4th 303, 314 [the heller opinion specifically expressed constitutional approval of the accepted statutory proscriptions against carrying concealed people v. flores (2008) 169 cal.app.4th 568, 575-576 [carrying a concealed firearm].) cases also upheld challenges to california laws prohibiting certain misdemeanants and others from possessing firearms. (flores, at pp. 574-575; people v. delacy, supra, 192 cal.app.4th at pp. 1488-1493; city of san diego v. boggess (2013) 216 cal.app.4th 1494, 1503 [welfare and institutions code section 8102, authorizing the seizure and 22 forfeiture of weapons belonging to persons detained due to their mental condition, did not violate second amendment].) most significantly here, mitchell concluded that section 21310 is neither facially unconstitutional nor unconstitutional as applied in that case. there, the defendant, mitchell, was removed from a san francisco trolley because he did not have a ticket, and trolley security officers found an 11-inch knife with a five-inch blade concealed in pants. (mitchell, supra, 209 cal.app.4th at p. 1369.) mitchell told the officers he carried the knife for self-defense. (ibid.) at trial, mitchell testified he was carrying the knife because he was going fishing, and used it as a fishing tool. (id. at pp. 1369-1370.) he appealed his conviction for violating former section 12020, subdivision (a)(4), arguing the statute was unconstitutional, both facially and as applied to him. (id. at p. 1370.) mitchell disagreed on both points. first, the statute was interpretation permitting prohibitions on the carrying of concealed weapons, we find no facial unconstitutionality in the statute proscribing the carrying of a concealed dirk or dagger. (mitchell, supra, 209 cal.app.4th at p. 1373.) because section 21310 limits, but does not completely ban, carrying a dirk or dagger for self-defense, the court applied the intermediate scrutiny test, which requires that the law serve an important governmental interest and be narrowly tailored to effectuate that interest. (id. at p. 1374.) he ban on carrying a concealed dirk or dagger serves the important governmental interest of allowing third parties to protect themselves from exposure to the risk of a surprise attack from a bearer of a weapon. the risk of a surprise attack exists even if the weapon bearer originally intends to use 23 the weapon only for legitimate self-id. at p. 1375.) one who carries a knife or pistol intending to use it only in lawful self-defense may overreact or make poor judgments and use the weapon in an unjustified fashion. (ibid.) the statute was narrowly tailored, mitchell reasoned, because an instrument qualifies as a dirk or dagger only if it is a knife or other instrument capable of ready use as a stabbing weapon that may inflict great bodily injury or death. further, the statute does not prohibit carrying a nonconcealed knife, a knife in a sheath, or certain folding knives, thereby providing other means of carrying a dirk or dagger for self-id. at p. 1375.) thus, the statute not run afoul of the second amendment because it is narrowly tailored to serve the important governmental interest of preventing exposure to the risk of surprise attacks and does not burden the right to bear arms in self-defense beyond what is reasonably necessary to serve that interest. (id. at pp. 1375-1376.) in distinguishing heller, mitchell explained that dirk/dagger statute restricts the concealment of weapons on a person to protect the rights of third parties not to be exposed to surprise attacks. the statute does not contain any express restriction on concealment of weapons on the person at home, and to the extent it is capable of being applied improperly in the home context . . . , any overbreadth can be cured on a case-by-mitchell, at p. 1376.) the statute was also constitutional as applied, mitchell reasoned, for essentially the same reasons: it served an important governmental interest of diminishing the risk of surprise attacks. (mitchell, supra, 209 cal.app.4th at p. 1378.) mitchell 24 testimony that he was using the knife for innocuous purposes because it had been instructed to consider all surrounding circumstances when deciding whether defendant knew the object could be used as a stabbing weapon. thus, the court reasoned, the case was not one id. at p. 1379.) c. application here genel argues that, as applied to him, section 21310 unconstitutionally infringes upon his right to bear arms in his home, and therefore his convictions must be reversed. inexplicably, tresponsive argument was initially limited to the contention that section 21310 is not facially unconstitutional. but genel never argued the statute was facially unconstitutional; instead, his contention is the statute is unconstitutional as applied in this case. accordingly, we sought and have received supplemental briefing from the parties. in their supplemental brief, the people contend that (1) according to -at-large, genel was not allowed to have knives concealed on his person; (2) the knives appellant in custody and he put his hands in his pockets, apparently reaching fo) genel was not using the knives against an illegal intruder; and (4) genel, as a parolee-at-large, is disqualified from possessing concealed arms for self-defense. in response, genel argues: (1) hellers conclusion that a felon may be prohibited from possessing firearms in his or her own home does not extend to the possession of other weapons; (2) the people fail to point to evidence that any parole condition actually prohibited him from possessing a small knife in his pocket at home; (3) unlike section statutory 25 prohibition on a specifically prohibits felons from possessing concealed knives in the home; especially in light of the fact he was acquitted of felony resisting an executive officer and of assault on a peace officer. when considering a claim that a facially valid statute has court evaluates the propriety of the application on a case-by-case basis to determine whether to relieve the defendant of the -analysis of the facts of a particular case . . . to determine the circumstances in which the statute . . . has been applied and to consider whether in those particular circumstances the [citation.] when reviewing an as-applied constitutional challenge on appeal, we defer to the triahistorical facts that are supported by substantial evidence, and then independently review the constitutionality of the statute mitchell, supra, 209 cal.app.4th at p. 1378.) application of section 21310 in this instance is, in our view, troubling. it was undisputed genel was alone in his residence, holding the small, commonplace knives in his pants for an innocent purpose to repair a rake so that he might comply knives against the parole agents, the jury acquitted him of assault with a deadly weapon upon a peace officer, and of resisting an executive officer and convicted him instead of the 26 lesser offense of unlawfully obstructing a peace officer, indicating d the knives against the officers. nonetheless, we are bound by rubalcavaconclusion that the concealed dirk or dagger statute, despite its overbreadth, is not unconstitutionally overbroad unless defendant shows some concrete impairment of constitutionally protected conduct. (rubalcava, supra, 23 cal.4th at p. 333; auto equity sales, inc. v. superior court (1962) 57 cal.2d 450, 455.) here, the only right genel contends was infringed is the second amendment right to bear arms. thus, possession of the knives in his home offends the second amendment, we must affirm his convictions. within the meaning of the second amendment. (see state v. deciccio (conn. 2014) 105 a.3d 165, 171, 197 [possession of a dirk knife and a police baton in his home was protected by the second amendment; dirk knives constitute ]; kopel et al., knives and the second amendment (2013) 47 u.mich. j.l. reform 167, 191-194 [knives can be used for self-defense and are arms within the meaning of the second amendment]; see generally heller, supra, 554 u.s. at pp. 624-625.) we also assume arguendo that genel was in his home, even though he did not own or rent the space and the owner of the garage, apparently, no longer wanted him to stay there. and we attach no significance to the fact genel was using the knives, at the moment the parole agents arrived, for yard work rather than for self-defense; logically, the fact an item is used sometimes as a tool, or for recreational purposes, should not impact a second amendment analysis. 27 concealed dirk or dagger is constitutional when applied to a mitchell, supra, 209 cal.app.4th at pp. 1373-1379.) it is also clear that a statute may, consistent with the second amendment, prohibit a possession of arms firearms in particular even in the home and even if used for self-defense. (see people v. flores, supra, 169 cal.app.4th at p. 575 [under heller, the second amendment permits the government to proscribe the possession of a firearm by any felon, including nonviolent offenders]; u.s. v. rozier (11th cir. 2010) 598 f.3d 768, 771 [hellerdisqualifying felons from possessing a firearm under any and all u.s. v. barton (3d cir. 2011) 633 f.3d 168, 169-170, 174-175, disapproved on another ground by binderup v. atty. gen. of u.s. of america (3d cir. 2016) 836 f.3d 336, 349;9 u.s. v. vongxay (9th cir. 2010) 594 f.3d 1111, 1117 arms is . . . consistent with the explicit purpose of the second ; u.s. v. darrington (5th cir. 2003) 351 f.3d 632, 635 [pre-heller case holding nd s generally to keep and bear their private arms as historically understood in this country .) the second amendment protects the right of law-abiding citizens to possess non-dangerous weapons for self-defense in the home, 9 binderup disapproved barton to the extent barton held the passage of time or evidence of rehabilitation could restore the second amendment rights of persons who have committed serious crimes.

(u.s. v. marzzarella (3d cir. 2010) 614 f.3d 85, 92, fn. omitted.) thus, the question here is whether section prohibition on carrying a concealed dirk or dagger violates the second amendment when applied to criminalize whether or not a non-felon could prevail on a such a second amendment claim10 a question we do not reach genel cannot, because he is a convicted felon and may be prohibited from having concealed arms in his home. heller considered certain longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms, including those prohibiting felons from carrying firearms, as presumptively lawful. (heller, supra, 554 u.s. at pp. 626-627.) hellers instruction to the district of columbia to permit heller to register his gun and to issue him a license was made expressly contingent upon a determination that heller was not (id. at p. 635; u.s. v. barton, supra, 633 f.3d at p. 171.) courts 10 (see, e.g., state v. herrmann (wis.app. 2015) 873 n.w.2d 257, 261-262 [statute entirely prohibiting possession of a switchblade knife, as applied to defendant in-home possession, violated second amendment where defendant had no prior convictions and was not using the knife for any offensive purpose; threat to public of a surprise attack from a person possessing a switchblade in his own residence for self-defense purposes was bear arms]; state v. deciccio, supra, 105 a.3d at pp. 171-172, 197, 203-the second amendment; as applied, statute categorically barring transport of dirk knives violated second amendment because it prohibited defendant from transporting knives in his weapons collection when moving from one residence to another, burdening his right and effectively banning his in-home possession].) 29 have repeatedly held that tno protection possession of weapons by a felon.

[citations.] this is so, even if a felon arguably possesses just as strong an interest in defending himself and his home as any law- (u.s. v. marzzarella, supra, 614 f.3d at p. 92; u.s. v. barton, supra, 633 f.3d at pp. 174-; u.s. v. vongxay, supra, 594 f.3d at pp. 1115, 1118 [felons are categorically different from the individuals who have a heller; people v. kim co as explained in u.s. v. rozier, supra, when issuing its ruling and settling the actual case and controversy at issue, heller is not disqualified from the exercise of second amendment rights, the district must permit him to register his handgun and must issue him a license this indicates that the first question to be asked is not whether the handgun is possessed for self-defense or whethe initial question is whether one is qualified to possess a question [] 30 amendment right to bear arms is not weighed in the same manner as that of a law-abiding citizen, such as the appellant in heller. while felons do not forfeit their constitutional rights upon being convicted, their status as felons substantially affects the level of protection (id. at pp. 770-771.) because of his status as a felon, the fact rozier may have possessed a handgun in his home for purposes of self-defense was id. at p. 771.) the same is true here. because the prohibition on genel, a felon, possessing a concealed dirk or dagger falls within presumptively lawful -end people v. delacy, supra, 192 cal.app.4th at pp. 1491-1492 [heller felon-in-possession prohibitions and similar categorical weapons possession bans to constitutional means- put differently, his as-applied challenge fails because application of the law has not deprived him of a protected right; as a felon, he has no protected second amendment right to bear concealed arms, even in his residence. (see mitchell, supra, 209 cal.app.4th at p. 1378 [setting forth standard for evaluation of as-applied claim].) genel contends, cursorily and without analysis, that hellerthe court p we are not convinced. the second amendment refers to arms, not just firearms, and nothing in heller as constricted as genel proposes. (see kopel et al., supra, knives and the second amendmentheller explained that the right secured by the second amendment 31 not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose. [citations.] for example, the majority of the 19th-century courts to consider the question held that prohibitions on carrying concealed weapons were lawful under the second amendment or (heller, supra, 554 u.s. at p. 626.) tlimited to ; thus, if the knives ms,hellerof course, if the amendment, the second amendment would not apply in the first even assuming for the sake of argument that genel is not disqualified from raising his second amendment claim by his status as a felon, section 21310 is constitutional as applied to him. because section 21310 does not entirely prohibit possession of a dirk or dagger, we apply intermediate scrutiny. (mitchell, supra, 209 cal.app.4th at pp. 1374, 1378.) under that test, the statute must serve an important governmental interest, and it and the governmental objective. (id. pose is to prevent surprise knife attacks. (id. at p. 1371.) it is undisputed that genel was a parolee. parolees are generally subject to unannounced searches at any time. if a parolee has a concealed weapon on his or her person when such an unannounced visit occurs, there is a danger that just such a surprise attack could transpire. as mitchell explained, one who carries a knife may intend to use it only for lawful purposes, but if an unsettling are startled or upset may overreact, lose their tempers, or make poor judgments under stress. even when they start out with good intentions, 32 persons who carry items capable of inflicting death or great bodily injury may use them in ways and in situations that are not justifiedmitchell, at p. 1375.) section 21310 protects against this danger by ensuring parolees are not armed with concealed knives. moreover, the statute does not prohibit a parolee from possessing a knife in his or her own home as long as it is not concealed on his or her person. thus, there is a reasonable fit between the statute and the governmental behavior. the statut s constitutional scrutiny because it is reasonably necessary to serve the important governmental interest of diminishing the risk of a surprise attack (mitchell, at p. 1378.) 33 disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports dhanidina, j. we concur: edmon, p. j. lavin, j.
