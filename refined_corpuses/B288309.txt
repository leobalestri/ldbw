(a)(4); count 1) and battery with serious bodily injury ( 243, subd. (d); count 2), with great bodily injury allegations as to count 1 ( 12022.7, subd. (a)), for his july 6, 2017 assault upon curtis wilshusen. he was also charged with misdemeanor battery ( 242) for an october 2, 2017 incident involving the same victim. defendant rented a room from mr. wilshusen. their relationship was fraught with conflict, and the two often argued and physically fought. on july 6, 2017, defendant walked into mr. thumbs into his eyes. mr. wilshusen was recovering from cataract surgery at the time, and suffered significant damage to his right eye. the jury found defendant guilty of counts 1 and 2, and found the great bodily injury allegation to be true, but found defendant not guilty of count 3. the peoplememorandum be stayed pursuant to se 1 all further statutory references are to the penal code. 3 on the sentencing memorandum indicated that the sentence for count 2 was subject to section 654. at the sentencing hearing, the court stated that it saw reason to deviate . . . sesentenced defendant to three years in prison for count 1, plus a three-year great bodily injury the coconcurrent sentence for count 2, as does the abstract of judgment. neither reflects that the sentence for count 2 was stayed pursuant to section 654. discussion defendant contends the trial court erroneously failed to stay his sentence for count 2. respondent tells us the court properly stayed the conviction, but that the sentencing minute order and abstract of judgment must be corrected to reflect the actual judgment of the court. section 654 people v. jones (2012) 54 cal.4th 350, 358.) a sentence prohibited by section 654 is imposed and stayed by the trial court. (people v. deloza (1998) 18 cal.4th 585, 592.) here, it is clear the court intended to impose and stay the sentence for count 2 pursuant to section 654. woral pronouncement of sentence constitutes the judgment and will control over the abstract of judgment, which is presumed to contain clerical error. (people v. mesa (1975) 14 cal.3d 466, 471.) 4 disposition the judgment is affirmed. the superior court is directed to amend the sentencing minute order and abstract of judgment to is stayed pursuant to section 654, and to send a certified copy to the department of corrections and rehabilitation. grimes, j. we concur: bigelow, p. j. rubin, j.
