(june 18, 2014) b237008, 2014 wl 2757631.) defendant gustavo alvarez (alvarez) and virginia alvarez (virginia) were married in 1996. virginia had one son from a prior marriage (michael), and alvarez and virginia had one son together (isaiah). alvarez had received a disability discharge from the u.s. navy prior to his marriage, and during the marriage he worked for at&t. alvarez and virginia separated in june 2001 and subsequently filed for divorce. relations between them became contentious when virginia made claims to portions of salary and navy disability pension. toward the end of 2002, however, the couple reconciled and halted divorce proceedings. in 2003, alvarez contacted defendant joseph sepulveda (sepulveda), whom he had known since childhood, and apparently solicited sepulveda to murder virginia. on july 3 5, 2003, sepulveda asked his girlfriend, jennifer barreau, to drive him to see a friend. barreau drove for a while, and then sepulveda told her to stop in the parking lot of a mexican restaurant. after 20 or 30 minutes, a green suv drove into the lot and parked. alvarez was driving the suv, and virginia was sitting on the passenger side. sepulveda exited barreaus car with a shotgun under his jacket and walked to the passenger side of the suv. according to witnesses, virginia had just gotten out of the suv when, without saying a word, sepulveda bent down on one knee, took aim, and shot virginia in the head. alvarez drive away. virginia died at the scene. at the time of the murder in 2003, virginia was 37 years old; michael (vifrom her first marriage) was ten was six years old. both children had been living with virginia and alvarez after her death, michael lived with his maternal grandmother, antonia rivera, and isaiah lived with alvarez.1 alvarez and sepulveda were in january 2010. , isaiah lived with rivera. 1 h in various ways. he received $8,600 from a class-action settlement that would have gone to virginia. he received about $40,000 as a month; these payments stopped in april 2010 after alvarez had received a total of $92,272. he also received $926 a month in survivor stopped in 2009 after alvarez had received more than $77,000. 4 ii. trial and first restitution hearing in 2011, alvarez and sepulveda were tried and convicted of first degree murder, with financial gain and lying in wait special circumstances; as to sepulveda only, the jury also made a true finding as to a firearm use enhancement (pen. code,  187, 190.2, subd. (a)(1), (15), 12022.53).2 alvarez was sentenced to life in prison without possibility of parole, and sepulveda was sentenced to life in prison without possibility of parole, plus 25 years to life. following trial, the prosecution sought an order of victim restitution pursuant tconduct the court held a restitution hearing and awarded restitution as follows: child rearing expenses: testified that she had had custody of michael since july 5, 2003 (the date of the murder), and custody of isaiah since january 10, 2010 michael had turned eighteen in december 2010, and isaiah would turn eighteen in april 2015. rivera testified that she spent approximately $500 per month for care, and a child support order provided by the prosecution 2001 had been $1,071 per month. and the child support order, the court awarded rivera restitution for child rearing expenses from the date she assumed custody of the boys until their eighteenth birthdays, calculated as follows: 2 all subsequent statutory references are to the penal code. 5 ($500 per month x 89 months) (for michael) + ($1,071 per month x 63 months) (for isaiah) = $44,400 + $67,673 = $112,073. future economic loss: at the time of her death, virginia was 37 years old, and her net salary was reported to be $3,237 per month, or $38,844 per year. the court assumed that virginia would have continued to work until age 55, i.e., for an additional 18 years. it therefore $699,196. burial expenses, trial attendance, and legal fees: the court awarded rivera $8,653 for burial expenses, $3,195 for costs associated with attending the criminal trial, and $15,000 for legal $2,586 for burial expenses. iii. first appeal both defendants appealed, challenging the convictions and the restitution awards. specifically, with regard to the restitution awards, defendants challenged the awards of child rearing expenses to virginia and future economic losses to the estate.3 we affirmed the convictions, but reversed the restitution awards in part, as follows: as to virginia mother, antonia rivera, we concluded that the trial court properly awarded restitution to compensate her for the expenses of raising michael and isaiah. we explained: tory victim under section 1202.4, and the costs she incurred were the direct result of the fact defendants 3 defendants did not challenge the other components of the restitution award (i.e., burial expenses, trial attendance costs, and legal fees). 6 murdered her daughter. defendants argue rivera had no legal obligation to care for the boys. but they were her grandchildren and, even if rivera acted both to provide for their needs as well as to satisfy her own peace of mind, the restitution award was proper. as to the award to the estate, we explained that subsequent to the restitution hearing, the supreme court held in people v. runyan (2012) 54 cal.4th 849, 853 (runyan, and thus was not entitled to restitution, on its own behalf. under runyan, therefore, we held estate had to be reversed. we agreed with the attorney general, however, that a new restitution hearing was appropriate to allow the trial court to determine in the first instance whether virginaward to the estate, should themselves be awarded restitution. we therefore remanded the case for a new hearing to determine sons. iv. second restitution hearing at the second restitution hearing, the prosecution argued that virginia would have supported michael until he turned 18 in december 2010, and would have supported isaiah until he turned 18 in april 2015. the prosecution also introduced evidence that alary at the time of her death in july 2003 was $4,724 per month, and that if virginia had continued to work for the 7 received annual step increases.4 the prosecution thus urged the court to award restitution to michael and isaiah, calculated as 35 percent (per child) of from the time of her death through eighteenth birthdays, plus interest of 10 percent from the date restitution was paid. on january 12, 2015, the trial court reaffirmed the prior restitution awards to rivera and matanga. the court further ordered restitution to michael, calculated as 25 percent of , from her death in august 2003 until michaeldecember 2010, plus interest, for a total of $270,239; and to isaiahincome, from the time of alvarrest in january 2010 until isaiah eighteenth birthday in april 2015, plus interest, for a total of $235,204. sepulveda and alvarez timely appealed from the restitution order. contentions defendants contend the trial court abused its discretion in awarding restitution to michael and isaiah. specifically, they urge: (1) michael and isaiah suffered no actual economic loss defendant alvarez supported them, and thus an award of direct 4 at the first restitution hearing, virginitime of her death was calculated to have been as $3,237 per month, or $38,844 per year. at the second restitution hearing, plus benefits was calculated to have been $4,724 per month ($56,668 per year), and was projected to increase to $6,537 per month ($78,444 per year) by april 2015. 8 economic support to the boys was duplicative and a windfall; (2) there was no evidentiary or rational basis to believe that 50 percent of her as net salary after taxes, not as a percentage of her gross salary. discussion i. legal principles a. victim restitution under section 1202.4 the intent of the legislature that a victim of crime who incurs any economic loss as a result of the commission of a crime shall receive restitution directly from any defendant convicted of that cr (id., subd. (a)(1).) accordingly, with specified exceptions, in every case in which a victim has suffered economic los conduct, the court shall require that the defendant make restitution to the victim or victims . . . (id., subd. (f).) absent extraordinary and compelling reasons (ibid.), restitution shall be of a dollar amount that is sufficient to fully reimburse the victim or victims for every determined economic loss incurred as the s crimin (id., subd.

(f)(3)(d)).runyan, supra, 54 cal.4th at p. 856.) for purposes of section 1202.4, s who has sustained economic loss as the result of a crime and who . . . [a]t the time of the crime was the parent . . . [or] child . . . of s. (k)(1), (3)(a).) 9 b. burden of proof and standard of review the evidentiary threshold for establishing a right to restitution is not rigorous: at a victim restitution hearing, a prima facie case for restitution is made by the people based in s testimony on, or other claim or statement of, the amount of his or her economic loss. once the victim has [i.e., the people have] made a prima facie showing of his or her loss, the burden shifts to the defendant to demonstrate that the amount of the loss is other than that claimed by the victim. people v. millard (2009) 175 cal.app.4th 7, 26.) s discretion in setting the amount of restitution is broad, and it may use any rational method of fixing the amount of restitution as long as it is reasonably calculated to make the victim whole. [there is no requirement the restitution order be limited to the exact amount of the loss in which the defendant is actually found culpable, nor is there any requirement the order reflect the amount of damages that might be recoverable in a civil action. people v. millard, supra, 175 cal.app.4th at pp. 2627.) courts recognize that, in many cases, neither the victim nor any degree of precision, but have noted that people v. prosser (2007) 157 cal.app.4th 682, 691.) abuse of rational basis for the amount of restitution ordered by the trial 10 court, no abuse of discretion will be found by the reviewing people v. prosser, supra, 157 cal.app.4th at p. 686.) ii. , a minor child has the right to recover loss of economic support as restitution in people v. giordano (2007) 42 cal.4th 644, our supreme court considered direct restitution under section 1202.4. specifically, the court addressed two issues, both relevant to the present case: (1) whether section 1202.4 authorizes a court to order restitution to a homicide victim for their future economic losses ; and (2) how a trial court should economic losses. because people v. giordano is critical to our analysis, we discuss it in some detail. the specific question before the court in people v. giordano was whether the lower court abused its discretion in awarding restitution to the wife of a man killed by an intoxicated driver. among other penalties, the court had awarded restitution to the three years prior to his death by five years. (people v. giordano, supra, 42 cal.4th 644 at p. 650.) the defendant appealed, urging economic loss. (id. at p. 664.) loss is not simply the wages or income that the deceased spouse would have earned but for his or her death. it explained11 section 1202.4 does not provide that a surviving spouse, or other family member or heir, steps into the shoes of decedent in order who incurs any economic loss as a result of the commission of a crime shall receive restitution directly from (italics added)]people v. giordano, supra, 42 cal.4th at p. 664.) instead, a surviving spouse may receive restitution only in the amount of his or her own economic loss, best described as the loss of economic support. (ibid , decedent was a husband and father, a significant element of damages is the loss of financial benefits he was contributing to his family by way of support at the time of his death and that support reasonably expected in the id. at p. 665.) the supreme court entire salary for a period of five years. the court annual earnings by five years. this method of calculation assumes that patricia armstrong was entitled to receive her gross annual earnings, not just that portion of his earnings that went to her economic support. it also assumes that five years is the appropriate term for loss of support restitution. years was [people v.] harvest [(2000)] 84 cal.app.4th [641], 653, a case in which a trial court ordered the defendant to pay $23,160 to the former wife of a deceased victim for the loss of child support decedent had been ordered to pay. in these ways, the 12 people v. giordano, supra, 42 cal.4th at pp. 665666, fn. omitted.) however, d conceded imprecis that defendant had not demonstrated an abuse of discretion because he had not shown that the restitution award exceeded loss of support. (people v. giordano, supra, 42 cal.4th at p. 666.) the court explained that in a criminal case, an award of restitution is committed to the sound discretion of the trial court, and no abuse of that discretion occurs as long as the determination of economic loss is reasonable, producing a nonarbitrary result. factors relevant to that determination will necessarily depend on the particular circumstances before the court. generally, the calculation of the loss of support may be informed by such factors as the earning history of the deceased spouse, the age of the survivor and decedent, and the degree to s income p(id. at p. 665, italics added.) in the present case, the defendant was correct that restitution should have been limited to the amount of dece. however, because decedent had been in his 30s when he was killed, the trial court could have calculated loss of support using a longer period of time than five years. thus, considering the restitution award as a wholefendant has not shown that a method resulted in an amount of restitutid. 13 at p. 666.) the court therefore found no abuse of discretion and affirmed the restitution award. (id. at p. 667.) iii. the restitution awards to michael and isaiah were within the defendants assert that the restitution awards to michael and isaiah were those awards (1) were duplicative of the restitution award to rivera, (2) to 50 percent of her income, and (3) gross (pre-tax) earnings. contentions fail because the restitution awards, considered economic support. a. no abuse of discretion in awarding restitution in -of-pocket expenses defendants assert that because the children were supported economically by their grandmother after [rivera] suffered economic loss. the children did nodefendants thus urge that the trial court erred when it found contention that their restitution obligation should be limited to out-of-pocket expenses reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of giordano. as discussed above, under giordano, a victim is entitled to receive as direct a crimpeople v. giordano, supra, 42 cal.4th at p. 662.) right to support was not limited to the support that their grandmother was able to provide; instead, the 14 children were entitled to the support they would have received from their mother. (see id. a significant element of contributing to his family by way of support at the time of his death and that support reasonably expected in the future. under giordano, therefore, the court was well within its discretion in ordering defendants to pay restitution to both rivera and the children if it concludedas its award indicates it didthat the children would have received greater financial support from virginia than their grandmother was able to provide. defendants make no showing that was without foundation, and thus an award of restitution to the children was not an abuse of discretion. b. no abuse of discretion in the amount of the restitution award having concluded that the trial court had discretion to award some restitution to michael and isaiah, we now consider whether the court abused its discretion in the amount of restitution it awarded. to summarize, the total restitution awards for support of michael and isaiah (taking into account the awards to michael, isaiah, and rivera) were as follows: michael: $44,400 (to rivera) + $270,239 (to michael) = $314,639 isaiah: $67,673 (to rivera) + $235,204 (to isaiah) = $302,877 total support: $314,639 (michael) + $302,877 (isaiah) = $617,516 defendants attack the restitution award by attacking its been awarded 50 percent of her gross income because there were 15 . . . informed calculations of and that, in any event, the restitution awards should have been net (post-tax) income, rather than her gross (pre-tax) income. in other words, defendants suggest we should reverse the restitution awards methodology was incorrect or imprecise. under people v. giordano, supra, 42 cal.4th 644, however, a restitution award may be reversed only if the defendant demonstrates that the award, considered as a whole, exceeds our inquiry, therefore, is necessarily of the total amount of the awards, rather than of the manner in which they were computed. defendants urge that the awards were excessive because, considered together, the amounts awarded to michael, isaiah, and rivera gross income (50 percent to the children, and 33 percent to rivera). the assertion that gross income is manifestly incorrect. defense counsel asserted at the [] presumably was derived by adding together the awards to rivera income in 2003. (($500 + $1,071) / $4,724 = 33.2 percent.) however, for the years 20032009, rivera was awarded just $500 s support only), which was approximately percent.) rivera was awarded $1,571 per month for only one year birthday]), which represented 16 $6,154 per month. ($1,571 / $6,154 = 25.5 percent.) and, for the years 20112015, rivera was awarded $1,071 support only), which was approxprojected gross income. ($1,071 / $6,154 = 17.1 percent.) moreover, restitution awards assumes, as the trial court did, that recoverable losses began when his mother died, and ended on his eighteenth birthday (20032010); and that losses began when his father was arrested, and ended on his eighteenth birthday (20102015). in fact, recoverable losses began immediately upon their r and arguably continued beyond their eighteenth birthdays. the trial court assumed that because isaiah lived with and was supported by his father between 2003 and 2010, isaiah did not begin to suffer recoverable losses until his father was arrested in 2010. in fact, california law provides that every child has a right to support from both parents. (e.g., the father and mother of a minor child have an equal responsibility to support their child in the manner s circumstancesboth parents are mutually responsible for the support of their 4053, subd. children should share in the standard of liv; see also moss v. superior court (1998) 17 cal.4th 396, 405 [ s ].) indeed, in the context of court-support survives the death of the noncustodial parent and becomes a in re marriage of gregory (1991) 230 cal.app.3d 112, 115.) thus, although 17 between 2003 and 2010 isaiah lived with and was supported by his father, he was entitled to restitution for the loss of the support his mother would have provided for him during those years. both b continued beyond their eighteenth birthdays: the trial court assumed that recoverable losses terminated on their eighteenth birthdays because their mother would not have had a legal obligation to support them beyond that time. however, our supreme court has explained in the context of a wrongful death action that a coverable losses may arise from the deprivation of something which, from all the circumstances of the particular case, it could reasonably be expected such beneficiary would have received from the deceased had his life not been takeneven though the obligation resting on the deceased to bestow such benefit may have been but a moral obligation. (corder v. corder (2007) 41 cal.4th 644, 661.) thus, for example, in mize v. atchison, t. & s. f. ry. co. (1975) 46 cal.app.3d 436, the court held that althouto his sons, ages 17 and 14 years old, was only $20 per month, a wrongful death decedent was legally obligated to pay $20 per month for [his stantially more, both in cash and medical bills. he had made periodic gifts to the sons, including giving the older son an automobile. he planned to send both sons to college. . . . [] under these circumstances we cannot say the trial judge was in error as a matter of law in determining that the amounts of the verdict did not exceed the pecuniary loss that the (id. at pp. 453454.) 18 under these authorities, the trial court properly could have awarded restitution to both boys beginning in 2003 and continuing into their adulthood. had the trial court done so, the restitution awards would have been substantially larger than those the court actually awarded. for example, had the court awarded $1,500 per month support (i.e., approximately one-third of virgini5 from the time of virgini until eighteenth birthdays, with an interest rate of 10 percent, reduced to present value as of the date of the 2015 restitution award, the total restitution awards would have been approximately $301,379 (michael) + $384,917 (isaiah), for a total of $686,296.6 alternatively, had the court awarded the same monthly support at the same interest rate until the boys 21st birthdays, the total restitution awards would have been approximately $366,917 (michael) + $429,680 (isaiah), for a total of $796,597. and, had the court awarded the same monthly support at the same interest rate until the boys 25th birthdays, the total restitution awards 5 in the absence of any contrary evidence, the assumption that virginia evenly divided her income between herself and her two sons appears eminently reasonable. 6 see exhibit a, post. we note that these calculations do not provided merely to illustrate the varieties of ways in which the restitution awards reasonably could have been calculated, rather than to revise or reform the restitution awards, and thus precise calculations are not essential to our analysis. 19 would have been approximately $429,680 (michael) + $472,548 (isaiah), for a total of $902,228.7 in short, defendants make no showing that a method actual loss of support, taking into consideration their young ages when their mother was murdered and the likelihood that she would have supported them beyond their eighteenth birthdays, would have resulted in restitution awards less than those the trial court awarded. accordingly, we find no abuse of discretion. 7 in light of the high costs of housing and post-secondary education, and the very weak job market for young adults, the assumption that virginia would have continued to support her sons until they were at least 21 or 25 years old is not an unreasonable one. 20 disposition the restitution order is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports edmon, p. j. we concur: aldrich, j. goswami, j.* * judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution. exhibit a year of murder 2003 2003 2003 2003 2003 2003 date of restitution order 2015 2015 2015 2015 2015 2015 age at murder 6 10 6 10 6 10 monthly support 1500 1500 1500 1500 1500 1500 interest rate 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 age when support ends 18 18 21 21 25 25 years of support 12 8 15 11 19 15 annual support 18,000.00 18,000.00 18,000.00 18,000.00 18,000.00 18,000.00 present value of support (2015) 384,917.11 301,379.11 429,680.44 366,917.11 472,548.65 429,680.44 total 686,296.22 796,597.55 902,229.09
