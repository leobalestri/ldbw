(a))1 and (2) making a criminal threat ( 422). the people further alleged that defendant personally inflicted great bodily injury upon walton ( 12022.7, subd. (e)). 1 all further statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise indicated. 5 a jury convicted defendant of injuring a spouse, cohabitant, or girlfriend and found that he personally inflicted great bodily injury; the jury acquitted defendant of making a criminal threat. the trial court imposed a prison sentence of six years, comprised of a midterm three-year sentence for the underlying crime and a low term three-year sentence for the great bodily injury enhancement. the court also issued a 10-year criminal protective order. defendant filed this timely appeal. discussion i. instructional issues defendant argues that the trial court erred (1) in not instructing the jury on the defense of habitation, and (2) in giving calcrim no. the criminal discovery act ( 1054 et seq.). we review issues involving jury instructions de novo (people v. simon (2016) 1 cal.5th 98, 133), but review for an abuse of discretion a trial people v. bowles (2011) 198 cal.app.4th 318, 325). a. defense of habitation instruction on general principles of law relevant to the issues raised by the (people v. townsel (2016) 63 cal.4th 25, 58, quoting people v. martinez (2010) 47 cal.4th 911, 953.) among other things, this duty encompasses the duty to instruct on any defenses to the charged crime(s) if the defendant is relying on that defense. (townsel, at p. 58.) it also includes a sua sponte duty to instruct on any applicable defense, but only if (1) there is substantial evidence supporting that defense, and (2) that defense is not 6 ibid.; people v. abilez (2007) 41 cal.4th 472, 517.) these dual prerequisites ensure that a absence of a request from the defense dhamper defense attorneys and put trial judges under pressure to glean legal theories and winnow the evidence for remotely tenable and people v. sedeno (1974) 10 cal.3d 703, 716-717, overruled in part on other grounds in people v. breverman (1998) 19 cal.4th 142.) defendant asserts that the trial court violated its sua sponte duty to instruct on applicable defenses because it did not instruct the jury on the defense of habitation. we reject this assertion. the defense of habitation excuses criminal liability when the owner or lawful occupant of property uses to eject a trespasser from his property. (people v. curtis (1994) 30 cal.app.4th 1337, 1360; people v. johnson (2009) 180 cal.app.4th 702, 709; calcrim no. 3475.) the trial court was not obligated to instruct the jury on this defense because the theory of the case at trial. defendant took the stand, and testified that (1) he invited walton into his apartment on sunday morning, (2) he subsequently and repeatedly asked her to leave, ttempted to . . . right arm around her. injuries were of her own doing: walton ripped off her own dress; she effectively head butted herself after she fell to the ground resisting escort from the apartment, and his head jerked forward (and hit hers) only after she pulled out some of his dreadlocks; and she slammed her own finger in his front door 7 accidentally. critically, defendant steadfastly denied using any force whatsoever. defense counsel emphasized as much in opening and closing argument when he argued defendant because the theory of defense at trial was that defendant used no force, a habitation instruction premised on the use of reasonable force was inconsistent. defendant makes two further arguments. first, he asserts that he did testify to the use of force. however, the record cites he offers refer to his putting his arm around walton to escort her from the apartment. this may not be a use of force at all, and is at a minimum not a use of force . indeed, defense counsel explained to the trial court during a conference that he had not requested a self-defense instructionwhich is e.g., people v. ross (2007) 155 cal.app.4th 1033, 1044-1045; see generally calcrim no. 3470) second, defendant contends that substantial evidence supported a habitation defense instruction because: (1) he testified that he asked walton to leave; and (2) he used force because (a) both he and walton sustained injuries, which suggests both used force, (b) the jury sent a note during nition of willfulif mutual combatantswhich suggests that at least some jurors thought he and walton were using force, asufficiency of the evidence to warrant instructions should be resolved in people v. flannel (1979) 25 cal.3d 668, 685). whether substantial evidence supported a habitation defense instruction is ultimately irrelevant because, as 8 explained above, that defense was inconsistent with the theory of sua sponte duty to instruct on that defense was not violated. b. discovery violation instruction five days after trial began and after the people rested their case-in-chief, several photographs that defendant allegedly took of his apartment or of his own injuries either during his standoff with swat or immediately after his release from jail the next day. the prosecutor objected that this disclosure violated the criminal discovery act because the photographs were not disclosed 30 days prior to trial, even though they were taken long before that. in light of defense counseldefendant had given him the photographthe trial court concluded that the defense attorney (rather than defendant) had violated his discovery obligations. the court allowed the defense to introduce the photographs into evidence, but gave the jury the following instruction: both the people and the defense must disclose their evidence to the other side before trial, within the time limits set by law. failure to follow this rule may deny the other side the chance to produce all relevant evidence, to counter opposing evidence, or to receive a fair trial. an attorney for the defense failed to disclose[] photographs taken by the defendant within the legal time period. the weight and significance of that evidence, you may consider the effect, if any, of that late disclosure. disclose evidence within the legal time period is not evidence that the defendant committed a crime. 9 defendant argues that the trial court erred in giving this jury there was a discovery violation, but contends that the instruction itselfwhich is set forth in calcrim no. 306is defective. the criminal discovery act specifically empowers a trial now-superseded standard jury instruction regarding nondisclosure (namely, caljic no. 2.28), courts have held that a jury instruction informing the jury of a discovery violation by the defense may be improper if it: (1) implies that the defendant is responsible for the violation, at least if defense counsel was the person actually responsible for the violation; (2) does not inform the jury that a discovery violation by itself is insufficient to find a defendant guilty of the underlying crime; and (3) tells the jury to a discovery violation to speculate on how to factor the violation into its deliberations. (people v. bell (2004) 118 cal.app.4th 249, 254-257; people v. thomas (2011) 51 cal.4th 449, 483-484 (thomas); people v. cabral (2004) 121 cal.app.4th 748, 753; people v. saucedo (2004) 121 cal.app.4th 937, 940-943; people v. lawson (2005) 131 cal.app.4th 1242, 1247.) the calcrim no. 306-based instruction in this case does not suffer from these defects. the instruction expressly states the photographs. the instruction also makes clear that the per guidance on how to 10 that graphs, and our supreme court in people v. riggs (2008) 44 cal.4th 248, 307-308 (riggs) indicated that this aspect of calcrim no. 306 gives sufficient direction to a jury. what is more, the arguments of counsel in this casewhich we look to in construing instructions (people v. franco (2009) 180 cal.app.4th 713, 720)provided further guidance because the prosecutor urged the jury to consider the late disclosure of the photographs when assessing their defendant asserts that such an instruction is improper unless the prosecution has demonstrated that it was actually prejudiced by the discovery violation, but our supreme court has yet to make that a prerequisite to the giving of a discovery violation instruction. (riggs, supra, 44 cal.4th at p. 308 instruction regarding a discovery violation is an actual effect on thomas, supra, 51 cal.4th at pp. 483-484 [noting that discovery violation instruction was improper for several reasons, including because marshal evidence in rebuttal we decline to do so. that the commentary to calcrim no. 306 cautions that the instruction should be given only where the prosecution is prejudiced does not alter our analysis, as such commentaryunlike authority from our supreme courtis not binding. (people v. morales (2001) 25 cal.4th 34, 48, fn. 7.) 11 ii. evidentiary issues defendant contends that the trial court erred in (1) he overheard defendant telling walton to leave, and (2) admitting, under evidence code section 1109, evidence that defendant had criticized the clothing of, and assaulted, a prior girlfriend. we review these evidentiary rulings for an abuse of discretion. (people v. bryant, smith and wheeler (2014) 60 cal.4th 335, 405.) a. hearsay would not be permitted to testify that he heard defendant tell statement was hearsay. other than by a witness while testifying at the hearing and . . . is offered to prove the truth of the matter stateditalics added.) unless an exception applies, hearsay is inadmissible. (id., subd. (b).) as the italicized language indicates, whether a particular statement is hearsay turns on the purpose for which it is introduced: thus, if a statement is rule barring hearsay does not apply. (e.g., people v. cooper (2007) 148 cal.app.4th 731, 747.) the trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the namely, that defendant actually wanted walton to leave his apartment (such that walton was a trespasser whom, under the 12 habitation defense, defendant could use reasonable force to eject). generally people v. garcia (2008) 168 cal.app.4th 261, 289, citing people v. jurado (2006) 38 cal.4th 72, 117, italics addedthis case is an exception to words support a habitation defense only if they are true; the mere fact that they were said and that walton heard them is not relevant. event not prejudicial because the testimony is relevant solely to a habitation defense which, as we explain above, was notand should not have beenbefore the jury. b. prior domestic violence incidents -in-chief, the prosecutor called sanova anderson (anderson) as a witness. anderson dated defendant for eight to ten years prior to 2012, and she testified that (1) defendant, in may 2011, cut her jeans from her body with a pair of scissors because he thought they were too tight; (2) (3) during the time they lived together, defendant would sometimes prevent her from leaving, sometimes by hiding her phone or her purse. before she began her testimony, the trial court instructed the jury that, if the people proved this conclude . . . that the defendant was disposed or inclined to commit domestic violence and, based on that decision, also conclude that the defendant was likely to commit and did 13 defendant argues that the trial court abused its discretion in aracter or a trait of his . . . character . . . is [generally] inadmissible when offered to prove his . . . c(evid. code,  1101, domestic violence as charged in the current case (id.,  1109, subd. (a)(1)). in deciding whether to admit other incidents of domestic violence to prassess (1) whether the uncharged incident meets the definition of id., subds. (a)(1) & (d)(3)); (2) whether the probative value of the uncharged incident is substantially outweighed by the danger of undue prejudice under evidence code section 352, wh . . . any corroboration and id., subds.

(evid. code,  1109, subd. (d)(3).) most, though perhaps not all, of the uncharged incidents qualify as domestic violence. as she wore themserious bodily injsuch, it qualified as domestic violence 14 under both the broader and narrower definitions. (fam. code,  ason in reasonable apprehension of imminent [ing] or attempt[ing] to cause bodily iabuseand hence domestic violenceunder both definitions. act of preventing anderson from leaving their residence by blocking her exit or hiding her phone or purse may not meet either definition of domestic violence, although its admission might have been admissible to prove a common scheme or under evidence code section 1101, subdivision (b) had a limiting instruction along those lines been given; admission of these background facts was not, in any event, prejudicial given the propriety of admitting the acts of bona fide domestic violence of which they were a part. the trial court also considered the admissibility of these incidents under evidence code section 352. although the trial court did not explicitly engage in and the trial court overruled that objection offenses. both temporal proximity and similarity are part of a people v. jandres (2014) 226 cal.app.4th 340, 355-356 (jandres) [looking to similarity, as part of evidence code section 352 analysis]; people v. robinson (2011) 199 cal.app.4th 707, 716 [same, as to whether uncharged act is 15 set forth its section 352 analysis as long as the record affirmatively demonstrate[s] that the courtanalysis (people v. hollie (2010) 180 cal.app.4th 1262, 1275; people v. corella (2004) 122 cal.app.4th 461, 471), we conclude that the actors relevant to the section 352 analysis affirmatively demonstrates that the court engaged in the required balancing. evidence code section 352 analysis on the record, defendant offers t352 analysis was erroneous. he argues that the prosecutor did not spell out on the record the factual details of the three prior defendant argues, the court could not engage in meaningful section 352 analysis. prior to trial, the prosecutor provided defendant with a written report disclosing those details; the prosecutor, at a pretrial hearing, mentioned his intent to have anderson testify to cutting incident; regarding these three incidents, the prosecutor had disclosed the specific facts to the defense, and the court knew enough about the incidentsnamely, that they were acts of physical violenceto engage in an evidence code section 352 analysis regarding their similarity to the charged offenses (and hence their probative value) and their prejudicial impact. defendant next asserts that the jeans-cutting incident was not sufficiently similar. we reject this assertion, as the uncharged incident and charged offense 16 may be different but still similar enough to admit under evidence code section 1109. (people v. hernandez (2011) 200 cal.app.4th 953, 966 [similarity under section 1109 is less than under section 1101, subdivision (b)]; cf. jandres, supra, 226 cal.app.4th at pp. 354-355 [attempted kidnapping not similar enough].) what is to enforce his notions of proper attire for women. it is unclear whether the trial court was required to engage in any analysis of whether admitting the uncharged incidents was an incident predates the charged offense by more than ten years. in this case, defendant and anderson dated for eight to ten years ending in 2011, and anderson did not recall the specific dates of the three incidents when he hit her; consequently, it is possible that one or more of the incidents occurred between 2001 and 2004that is, more than ten years before the august 2014 offense charged in this case. even if we assume that the trial that analysis involves the same considerations as an evidence code section 352 analysis (people v. johnson (2010) 185 cal.app.4th 520, 539); because the court engaged in the latter, it also engaged in the former. defendant raises one further challenge to the admission of this evidences failure to require the prosecutor to state on the record the specific details underlying question prospective jurors regarding those prior, uncharged incidents. although a criminal defendant certainly has the right r people v. chapman (1993) 15 cal.app.4th 136, 141), 17 that right does not entitle a defendant to question prospective jurors on how they would react to each item of evidence to be presented at trial. indeed, if such a right existed, all evidentiary rulings would have to be made prior to voir dire; that is not the law. furthermore, defendant has not set forth what additional questions he would have asked the jury; without this showing, he cannot establish prejudice. (people v. taylor (2010) 48 cal.4th 574, 638; see generally code civ. proc.,  223 [requiring showing of prejudice for improper limitations on voir dire].) iii. sentencing at his sentencing hearing, defendant personally addressed the trial court and used that opportunity to complain that he had to contest the charges. the court subsequently commented that it was not persuaded by e court pondered aloud, why in the world did he refuse to come out for . . . almost ; and (2) as observed by neutral witnesses absolutely consistent the court also for the incident with walton. flonger prison sentence of eight years and instead imposed a six-year prison sentence. e is invalid because (1) the court improperly penalized him for exercising his constitutional rights not to answer his front door and to go to 18 trial, and (2) the court erred in not sentencing him to probation sentence for an abuse of discretion (people v. sandoval (2007) 41 cal.4th 825, 847), although we examine the constitutional validity of a sentence de novo (see people v. acosta (2018) 20 cal.app.5th 225, 229, review granted apr. 25, 2018, s247656). it is well punish a person for exercising a constitutional right.in re lewallen (1979) 23 cal.3d 274, 278, citing bordenkircher v. hayes (1978) 434 u.s. 357, 363.) it is also well settled that a defendant has the right not to answer his door when the police knock (kentucky v. king (2011) 563 u.s. 452, 469-470) and that a defendant has a right to go to trial to proclaim his innocence, such that a court may consider lack of remorse for a defendant who goes to trial only if the evidence of his guilt was overwhelming (people v. key (1984) 153 cal.app.3d 888, 901; people v. leung (1992) 5 cal.app.4th 482, 507). read in context, however, the trial court did not refer punish him, but rather a reason explaining why, in its view, the evidence overwhelmingly supported the guilty verdict on the injury to a spouse, cohabitant, or girlfriend countthereby making reliance on where, as here, a crime involves the infliction of great bodily injury, a court may place a defendant on probation only in []whether a case is fact[s] or 19 circumstance[s] indicating that the basis for the statutory limitation on probation, although technically present, is not fully applicable to the case.people v. superior court (du) (1992) 5 cal.app.4th 822, 832; see also cal. rules of court, rule 4.413(c)(1).) defendant proffers a few reasons why this case is, in his view, unusual(1) the jury believed the case was one lton provoked the incident; (3) nose may not ay not have been caused by the head butt; and, more generally, (5) this case is less severe than other corporal injury to a spouse, cohabitant, or girlfriend cases. none of these reasons renders this case unusual. the first is based on a jury note, not a jury findingand the trial court (correctly) informed al version of the facts, which the jury necessarily rejected. the fourth reason is unsupported by any evidence in the record. and the last reason -ness does not turn on whether worse cases exist, but whether this case is the case was not. 20 disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. ______________________, j. hoffstadt we concur: _________________________, acting p. j. ashmann-gerst _________________________, j. chavez
