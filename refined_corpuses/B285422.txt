(prior opinion), we set forth the underlying facts of defendants case as follows: on october 29, 1998, two long beach bicycle patrol officers stopped defendant . . . because [defendant] was riding a bicycle without a light and had been outside the crosswalk when crossing that he stop and instead rode his bike into a bike ridden by one of the officers. when the officers tried to grab [defendant], they saw [defendant] reach for his waistband. [defendant] pointed a gun at one of the officers. the other officer also felt someone pulling upward on his own firearm. [defendant] had to be wrestled to the ground. the gun [defendant] used had a loaded magazine, 1 all statutory references are to the penal code. 3 in 1999, defendant pleaded guilty to possession of a firearm by a felon (former  12021, subd. (a)(1)),2 and admitted he iolent felonies ( 667, subds. (b)-(i), 1170.12, subds. (a)-(d)), a prior conviction of a serious felony ( 667, subd. (a)(1)), and a prior prison term conviction ( 667.5, subd. (b)). the trial court ultimately sentenced defendant to state prison for a term of 25 years to life in accordance with the three strikes law. we in our prior opinion. in december 2012, shortly after the passage of proposition 36, defendant filed a petition to recall his sentence under section 1170.126. the trial court issued an order to show cause why the petition should not be granted. the district attorney filed an opposition and supplemental opposition with supporting evidence. on september 18, 2017, the trial court held a hearing on defenda3 at the outset of the hearing, the trial court confirmed its understanding of the facts, stating, i understand the facts to be as follows: [defendant] was riding his bicycle after dark. he did not have a headlight on, at least the officers thought. they attempted to stop him. he did not obey all the chances to stop. eventually officer mascrro grabbed him to stop him. they both fell off their bikes. officer mascrro and his partner were both on bikes. they got into a struggle, and the 2 the crime of possession of a firearm by a felon is now found at section 29800, subdivision (a)(1). 3 the multi-petition and the hearing are attributable to multiple extensions request. 4 defendant pointed a 9mm semi automatic handgun at officer mascrro. those are the facts.defense counsel and the prosecutor agreed. thereafter, the trial court denied the petition, finding defendant statutorily ineligible for the requested relief beyond a reasonable doubt, explainingthe argument of counsel, i find him statutorily ineligible for recalling and resentencing pursuant to penal code section 1170.126 because during the commission of the offense, he both used a firearm and was armed with a firearm. he intended to cause great bodily injury. i think i can make that finding, if you chest, you are not wishing him happy birthday. accordingly, the petition for recalling and resentencing is denied with prejudice pursuant to 1170.126 defendant filed a timely notice of appeal. discussion that a defendant who had two or more prior convictions of violent or serious felonies receive a third strike sentence of a minimum of 25 years to life for any current felony conviction, even if the people v. johnson (2015) 61 cal.4th 674, 680.) when defendant was sentenced in 1999 for his firearm possession conviction in this case, he received a sentence of 25 years to life in accordance with the three strikes law, because he had two prior qualifying convictions. in november 2012, voters approved proposition 36, the three strike reform act of 2012. (people v. osuna (2014) 225 5 cal.app.4th 1020, 1026 (osuna), disapproved on other grounds people v. frierson (2017) 4 cal.5th 225, 235-236, 240, fn.8.) proposition 36 changed the three strikes law in that the 25 years to life sentence for third-strike defendants applies only current crime is a serious or violent felony or the prosecution has pled and proved an enumerated disqualifying (ibid.) in all other cases, the defendant will be sentenced as a second strike offender. (ibid.) the act also enacted section 1170.126, a post-is serving an indeterminate life sentence imposed pursuant to the [t]hree [s]trikes [l]aw for a crime that is not a serious or violent felony and who is not disqualified, may have his or her sentence ibid.) resentencing if, inter aoffense, the defendant used a firearm, was armed with a firearm or deadly weapon, or intended to cause great bodily injury to  667, subd.

(see  667, subd. (e)(2)(c)(iii), 1170.12, subd.
