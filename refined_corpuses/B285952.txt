(a)(1); people v. espinoza (2018) 27 cal.app.5th 908, 913914.) such prejudicial error may arise from cthe adverse immigration consequences of his or her plea.

(people v. fairbank (1997) 16 cal.4th 1223, 1254; people v. aguirre (2016) 199 cal.app.4th 525, 528.) however, where such a motion raises ineffective assistance of counsel and thereby implicates a we uphold the trial courts factual findings if they are supported by substantial evidence and we exercise our independent judgment on the legal issues.people v. ogunmowo (2018) 23 cal.app.5th 67, 76; people v. cromer (2001) 24 cal.4th 889, 894.) thus, a trial court may be found to have abused its discretion if its factual findings are not supported by substantial evidence or if it misinterprets or misapplies the applicable legal standard. (people v. smith (2016) 245 cal.app.4th 869, 873; global modular, inc. v. kadena pacific, inc. (2017) 15 cal.app.5th 127, 150.) 5 with these principles in mind, we conclude the superior court vacate his plea under section 1473.7. in ruling on the motion, the court completely ignored claim that upon accepting the plea he had not understood the severe immigration assurances that the plea was the best option available. specifically, while characterizing the claim as revisionist history -serving, the court emphasized the 21-year gap between the conviction and the motion to vacate to suggest an unreasonable delay in bringing the motion and indicated defense counsel could not be faulted for failing to predict or prevent the adverse immigration consequences of the plea. motion to vacate. subdivision (b)(2) of section 1473.7 requires a subdivision (a)(1) by filing a motion after receiving notice of pending immigration removal proceedings or a removal order. appellant began his efforts to vacate the conviction as soon as he received notice of the basis for the removal proceedings against him, and he diligently sought relief under section 1473.7 by filing his motion within six months of the effective date of the statute. plea and his motion to vacate highlights one of the many difficulties presented by challenging a guilty plea made 21 years earlier, but does not provide a basis under the statute for denying the motion. faulted for failing to predict or prevent removal proceedings 21 years in the future also constitutes an invalid basis for denying 6 immigration consequences of a plea is not whether counsel should have predicted initiation of federal removal proceedings in the acceptance of those ramifications at the time of the plea. while actor to consider, whether counsel could be expected to foresee the precise nature of the immigration consequences is irrelevant to the determination of the motion to vacate.3 section 1473.7, subdivision (e)(1) providesgrant the motion to vacate the conviction or sentence if the moving party establishes, by a preponderance of the evidence, the existence of any of the grounds for relief specified in subdivision (a).those grounds are limited to a showing of prejudicial error which damag 3 in this regard, the recent amendment to the statute, which took effect january 1, 2019, shows the importance of assessing the state of mind of the defendant and not counsel at the time of the plea by clarifying that the trial court may, but need not find ineffective assistance of counsel in finding a plea invalid under section 1473.7, subdivision (a)(1), the recent amendment to the statute.
