of facts prosecution evidence on july 20, 2013, around 6:30 p.m., markeis parish, shawn sherman, and garvey sims were crossing crenshaw boulevard at the intersection of 78th place. rosa garcia was driving southbound on crenshaw at the time, and diamond manuel was driving northbound. when parish stepped into the street, all of the traffic was stopped at a red light at 76th place and crenshaw. 1 defendant was charged in count 3 with an additional allegation of driving under the influence as the reason for the suspension. defendant waived a jury for purposes of that finding, which the trial court later found to be true. 3 garcia stopped in the far right hand lane before the intersection at crenshaw and 78th, to allow parish, sherman, and sims to cross the street. manuel also stopped to let n change lanes to get around her car. she estimated the car was going around 70 or 75 miles per hour. manuel the street going the opposite way really, really fast, about 90 to 100 sherman, who was

received a call to respond to the intersection of 78th and crenshaw. by the time he arrived at the scene, a private ambulance was already attending to parish. parish was lying face down with multiple

that same evening, phillip jones was driving near imperial highway and spinning avenue when he noticed a silver mercedes, which appeared to have been wrecked. jones saw defendant get out of the car, look at it while walking with an unstable gait. as jones continued watching, defendant ran across the street and out of sight. after driving around the corner, failing to locate defendant, and checking the mercedes to see if someone was injured, jones called the police. investigation los angeles county coroner james ribe performed an autopsy on parish and prepared a diagram during the

ribe further stated that parish suffered a hemothorax, which is a bleeding into the chest cavity caused by internal injuries. los angeles police officer maurice hallauer investigated the collision that occurred at 78th and crenshaw. miles per hour at the time of impact traveling after parish lost contact with the car was 43 miles per hour. officer hallauer estimated that prior to impact, defendant was traveling at least 86 miles per hour and at most 129 miles per hour. los angeles police officer hayssen aguirre, a collision investigator, responded to 78th and crenshaw to recover evidence, including bloodstains, and was present when another officer took measurements of the locations of recovered items. los angeles police officer ruben mendoza investigated the collision and sought to locate the driver of the mercedes. officer mendoza went to imperial and spinning, which was about two and a half to three miles away from 78th and crenshaw, in order to inspect the mercedes that had been abandoned at that location. he noticed a red stain on girlfriend, rashida williams. the next day, officer mendoza spoke with walker who took him to 2916 west 78th place, the address

did not know any other person who drove her mercedes other than defendant. it was stipulated that collision. on july 25, 2013, los angeles police department criminalist mandel medina compared the mercedes with pieces of the car that were recovered from the scene of the collision, and concluded that several pieces had come from the mercedes. medina also recovered trace evidence or red stains from the windshield, trunk lid, steering wheel, and dna evidence obtained from the windshield, trunk lid, and steering wheel matched the dna profile of parish. the dna profile obtained from the defense evidence defendant offered a photograph in his defense and rested without testifying. discussion defendant contends that the trial court prejudicially erred in admitting five autopsy photographs defendant argues the photographs had limited if any probative value regarding the issue of gross negligence, and their probative value was substantially outweighed by the danger these photographs would evoke an emotional bias against him. we conclude the court acted within its discretion in admitting the five autopsy photographs. 7 relevant facts prior to trial, defense counsel indicated that the prosecution presented her with numerous objections to them. the prosecutor responded that there were about 30 photographs but he did not intend to introduce them all. he hey are relevant is because the heart of this case is, you know, was this gross negligence, not did ed but to show his injuries. his specific injuries as shown in the photos show how egregious, in the p after the trial court asked whether the coroner would be testifying about the injuries as well, the prosecutor stated hem is the best evidence that shows what happened to him. the prosecutor further stated that he submitted 14 of photographs after taking out 15 that he would not use, but he probably would not even show all 14. he argued the injuries to his abdomen i think are very relevant. i think the ones showing injuries to his head as well as his shoulder are relevant because er that did, in fact, penetrate the windshield of the car. that tordinary the court responded much injury. you could hit someone at a higher speed, and they may still die and not have this much injury. negligence. what determines the gross negligence is what would arguably be the rate of speed. so the injury is really a separate issue . . . ultimately, i think these photos, 8 especially a number of them, are inflammatory to the point where i think it would affect the court responded that it understood and would likely limit the number of photographs, but would need to see them and have the court later examined and discussed autopsy photograph nos. 116 through 128 with defense counsel and the prosecutor. during this process, the prosecutor agreed to remove photograph nos. 117, 118, 119, 121, 124, 126, 127, and 128. the prosecutor legs, and photograph no. 120 as showing the wounds on the top of his head, which shows the force with which he either hit the car or hit the ground. he stated that photograph no. 122 shows shows raph no. 125, the trial court found admissible five autopsy photographsnos. 116, 120, 122, 123, and 125. the state, and it does give prejudice. on the other hand, they do appear to be relevant. during trial, defense counsel objected to photograph nos. 116 and 120 during autopsy photographs being admitted into analysis substantially outweighed by the probability that its admission will . . . create substantial code,  352.) [t]he decision to admit victim photographs is a discretionary matter we will not disturb on appeal unless the prejudicial effect of the photographs clearly 9 o (people v. taylor (2001) 26 cal.4th 1155, 1168.)(people v. davis (2009) 46 cal.4th 539, 615.) defendant contends the autopsy photographs were wholly unnecessary for the jury to make a finding as to whether defendant acted with gross negligence. this contention lacks merit. [a]utopsy and crime scene photographs are not made inadmissible because they are offered to prove an issue not in dispute. (people v. watson (2008) 43 cal.4th 652, 684; people v. crittenden (1994) 9 cal.4th 83, 132-133.). as our supreme court has explained: because they had no bearing on the only disputed question at trial (his mental state), we have made clear that the absence of a defense challenge to particular aspects of the (people v. lewis (2001) 25 cal.4th 610, 641.) the autopsy photographs demonstrate parish, and corroborate . depicting making the admission of the autopsy photographs cumulative. it is true that the however, is immaterial for purposes of determining the relevance of evidence that other evidence (people v. scheid (1997) 16 cal.4th 1, 16; see also people v. anderson (2001) 25 cal.4th 543, 592 e they illustrate evidence presented by other mean; in re romeo c. (1995) 33 the only ban on cumulative evidence is found in evidence code section 352 even if the autopsy photographs were cumulative this does not demonstrate the trial court abused its broad discretion. rosecutors . . . are not obliged to prove their case with evidence solely from live witnesses; the jury is entitled to see details of the bodies to determine if the ev 10 (people v. garcia (2008) 168 cal.app.4th 261, 294; accord, people v. lewis (2009) 46 cal.4th 1255, 1282.) as stated previously, the autopsy extensive injuries from the collision. (people v. virgil (2011) 51 cal.4th 1210, 1248 [photographs are relevant s testimony]; people v. howard (2010) 51 cal.4th 15, 33 [autopsy photographs are admissible to clarify the testimony of prosecution witnesses regarding the crime scene and the autopsy].) defendant cites people v. gibson (1976) 56 cal.app.3d 119, 135, in arguing that the autong to ordinary defendant contends the photographs were highly inflammatory as they attached to his body, which were used by medical personnel during their efforts to revive him. while we agree the photographs are undoubtedly unpleasant, we hold the photographs cannot be fairly characterized as sensational or unduly gruesome. (see people v. davis, supra, 46 cal.4th at pp. 558, 615 s badly decomposed body not gruesome].) through prosecutorial discretion, and careful control of the record by the trial court, the 30 autopsy photographs resulted in admission of only 5 into evidence. the record, as a whole, demonstrates no violation of the principles of evidence code section 352. assuming the court abused its discretion in admitting the five autopsy photographs, the photographs did not disclose to the jury any information that was not presented in detail throno more inflammatory than the graphic testimony provided by a number of s (people v. heard [(2003) 31 cal.4th. 946,] 978.)people v. cole (2004) 33 cal.4th 1158, 1199.) thus, admission of the photographs was harmless under both chapman v. california (1967) 386 u.s. 18, 22-24 and people v. watson (1956) 46 cal.2d 818, 837. (people v. cole, supra, at p. 1199.) 11 disposition the judgment is affirmed. kriegler, j. we concur: turner, p. j. mosk, j.
