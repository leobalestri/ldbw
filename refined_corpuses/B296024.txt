(b)-(i), 1170.12, subds. (a)-(d)). the trial court sentenced defendant to a term of 25 years to life in prison, plus two years due to the prior prison terms. we affirmed the judgment in people v. fontenot, supra, b095765. in 2013, after the passage of proposition 36, defendant filed his first petition for recall of sentence. the trial court denied the petition, finding defendant statutorily ineligible for resentencing under the provisions of sections 1170.126, subdivision (e)(2), and 667, subdivision (e)(2)(c)(iii), since he was armed with a firearm during the commission of the offense. we affirmed the trial people v. fontenot, supra, b267335. after the publication of people v. frierson (2017) 4 cal.5th 225, in which the california supreme court held that the reasonable doubt standard, rather than the preponderance of evidence standard, applied to burden to 2 our summary of the case is taken from the allegations of 11, 2018, as well as exhibits attached to the petition, which include our opinions in prior appeals relating to this case. (see people v. fontenot (oct. 1, 1996, b095765) [nonpub. opn.]; people v. fontenot (aug. 17, 2016, b267335) [nonpub. opn.].) 3 establish ineligibility for resentencing under proposition 36, defendant filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus. counsel was appointed to represent defendant in his second petition to recall sentence, which was filed in september 2018. the trial court considered the second petition and exhibits, which included t(exhibit n), and argument of counsel. on february 13, 2019, the trial court found beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was armed with firearms during the commission of his crime of felon in possession of a firearm, making him ineligible for resentencing. the petition was denied. defendant filed a timely notice of appeal from that order. in his supplemental brief, defendant argues that his 1995 conviction was not supported by substantial evidence, and that the arresting officer made inconsistent statements at trial and in pretrial proceedings. defendant also argues that during deliberations in the 1995 trial, some jurors were undecided possession of a firearm was constructive or actual. in addition, defendant contends that the 1995 trial court erred in determining that his prior assault conviction qualified as a strike under the three strikes law. those issues are not subject to relitigation here. (cf. people v. cabrera (2018) 21 cal.app.5th 470.) we have examined the entire record and are satisfied that responsibilities and that no arguable issue exists. we conclude that defenwende procedure and our review of the record, received adequate and effective appellate review of the judgment entered against 4 him in this case.
