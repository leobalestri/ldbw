(people v. wende (1979) 25 cal.3d 436, 441.) our review of the record reveals that we lack jurisdiction to consider this appeal because it was not timely filed. (cal. rules of court, rule 8.308(a); people v. mendez (1999) 19 cal.4th 1084, 10941095 (mendez).) procedural background defendant was charged by information in count 1 with assault with a deadly or dangerous weapon ( 245, subd.
