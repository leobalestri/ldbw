(b), counts 1 and 4) and two counts of making a criminal threat ( 422, counts 2 and 3) in or about march 2009. as to counts 1, 2, and 3, the information also alleged that williams had suffered one prior serious or violent felony -(i), 1170.12, subds. (a)-(d)). represented by private counsel, williams pleaded not guilty and denied the special allegation. to represent him. on march 29, faretta v. california (1975) 422 u.s. 806, 819 [95 s.ct. 2525, 45 l.ed.2d 562] and relieved the on june competence under section 1368. criminal proceedings were suspended, and williams was ordered examined by a court-appointed mental health expert. at some point, the trial court reappointedefender as counsel of record due to a conflict of interest. in august 2010, after some discussion with counsel, the trial court found williams competent to stand trial, set aside section 1368 proceedings, and reinstated criminal proceedings. in accordance with the plea agreement, on january 10, 2011, the trial court sentenced williams to concurrent 1 all further statutory references are to the penal code. 3 three-year state prison terms.2 credits according to a now superseded version of section 4019. that section, as it read in 2009, allowed prisoners in local custody to be deemed to have served six days for every four days of actual confinement. (former  4019, subds. (b), (c), (f) & (g); stats. 1982, ch. 1234,  7, p. 4553 [former  4019, subd. (f)].) williams was awarded 1,010 days of presentence custody credits (673 actual days and 337 days of conduct credits). williams was ordered to pay an $80 court security fee, a $60 criminal conviction assessment, a $50 lab fee, and a $600 restitution fine. the court imposed and suspended a parole revocation fine. ( 1202.45.) motion to modify his presentence custody credits based on an amendment to section 4019 that was expressly applicable to crimes committed on or after its effective date of operative october 1, 2011 and allowed four days to be deemed served for every two days of actual confinement. (stats. 2011, ch. 15,  482, stats. 2011-212, ch. 12,  35.) discussion 1. williams asserts he is entitled to an additional 336 days of conduct credits based on the newly amended section 4019, even though he was sentenced prior to october 1, 2011. specifically, williams contends: (1) the amendment to section 4019 applies retroactively, despite its express language, and (2) the denial of the additional credits violates the equal protection clause. people v. brown (2012) 54 cal.4th 314 (brown brown, the california supreme court determined that an earlier version of section 4019 prisoners in local custody first became eligible to earn credit for good behavior at the increased rate beginning on the id. at p. 318.) brown reasoned that statutory construction did 2 williams also admitted violating probation on two misdemeanor convictions. the trial court revoked and terminated probation and imposed a two-year concurrent sentence. 4 e statute contains no express declaration that increased conduct credits are to be awarded retroactively, and no clear and unavoidable implication to that effect arises from the relevant extrinsic sources, i.e., the legislative id. at p. 320.)3 brown also decided that prospective application of the earlier version of section 4019 did not violate the equal protection clauses of the federal and state constitutions. (u.s. const., 14th amend.; cal. const., art. i,  7, subd. (a).) t correctional purposes of a statute authorizing incentives for good behavior [citation] are not served by rewarding prisoners who served time before the incentives took effect and thus could not have modified their behavior in response. that prisoners who served time before and after former section 4019 took effect are not similarly situated necessarily brown, supra, 54 cal.4th at pp. 328-329.) we see no reason the rationale of brown should not apply with equal force to the newly amended section 4019. (see people v. lara (2012) 54 cal.4th 896, 906, fn. 9.) is entitled to additional presentence custody credits by reason of retroactive application of the latest amendment to section 4019. 2. the the information alleged that in 1995 williams had suffered a serious or violent juvenile adjudication for assault with a firearm (pen. code,  245, subd. (a)(2)) (l.a. county sup. ct. no. pj07331) making him eligible for sentencing under the three strikes law with respect to count 1, 2 and 3. at a january 11, 2010 pretrial hearing, the the court. 3 in contrast to the prior statute, the legislature expressly stated its intent that the new amendment not be applied retroactively. 5 on march 29, 2010, willjuvenile court file had not yet been found, and there was a question as to whether the juvenile adjudication related to williams or to another minor arrested with williams. at a pretrial hearing on april 12, 2010, at which williams was representing himself, the prosecutor informed the trial court the original plea offer was four years for making a criminal threat or double the two-year-lower term under the three strikes law. however, she would be willing to offer a term of four years, without the strike. williams rejected the offer. the prosecutor also advised the juvenile court records still could not be found. when williams entered his negotiated plea to counts 3 and 4, there was no mention of the prior strike allegation as to count 3. the trial court did not include the count. rather the trial court told williams he was facing a maximum state prison sentence of seven years, consisting of three years for making a criminal threat and four years for stalking. at sentencing, the trial court imposed the agreed upon sentence and granted the although it appears the prosecution did not intend to proceed on the prior strike allegation, it should have been dismissed. (see  667, subd. (f)(2).) dispostion the judgment is affirmed. the matter is remanded to the trial court to dismiss the prior strike allegation as to count 3, making a criminal threat. the court is ordered to prepare a new abstract of judgment reflecting the dismissal of the prior strike allegation and to forward it to the department of corrections and rehabilitation. zelon, j. we concur: woods, acting p. j. jackson, j.
