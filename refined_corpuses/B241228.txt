(pen. code,1  245, subd. (a)(1)). defendant admitted a prior serious felony allegation was true. ( 667, subds. (b)-(i), 1170.12.) he was and affirm the judgment as modified. ii. discussion a. force likely to produce great bodily injury - ex-girlfriend, athena scott, saw defendant on top of mr. sparling. defendant was mr. sparling was kneeling down. defendant was hitting him. defendant was swinging roberto pichardo saw mr. sparling at the hospital a few days later. mr. sparling had bruises and red marks on his head and face. defendant concedes the evidence supported a simple assault conviction. (the jury was given the option to so convict him.) he argues, however, that there was insufficient evidence he used force likely to produce great bodily injury. we find there was substantial evidence of force likely to produce great bodily injury. in reviewing a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, we apply the following 1 further statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise noted. 3 judgment and presume the existence of every fact the trier could reasonably deduce from the evidence in support of the judgment. the test is whether substantial evidence supports the decision, not whether the evidence proves guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. people v. mincey (1992) 2 cal.4th 408, 432; accord, people v. zamudio (2008) 43 cal.4th 327, 357.) our sole function is to determine if any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. (jackson v. virginia (1979) 443 u.s. 307, 319; people v. castaneda (2011) 51 cal.4th 1292, 1322; people v. bolin (1998) 18 cal.4th 297, 331; taylor v. stainer (9th cir. 1994) 31 f.3d 907, 908-pothesis whatever is there sufficient people v. bolin, supra, 18 cal.4th at p. 331, quoting people v. redmond (1969) 71 cal.2d 745, 755; accord, people v. zamudio, supra, 43 cal.4th at p. 357.) neither physical contact nor actual injury is a required to support a conviction under section 245. (people v. aguilar (1997) 16 cal.4th 1023, 1028; people v. brown (2012) 210 cal.app.4th 1, 7; people v. beasley (2003) 105 cal.app.4th 1078, 1086.) further, it is well established that an assault with force likely to produce great bodily injury may be perpetrated by the use of hands or feet alone. (people v. aguilar, supra, 16 cal.4th at p. 1028; people v. wingo (1975) 14 cal.3d 169, 176; people v. tallman (1945) 27 cal.2d 209, 212; people v. hinshaw (1924) 194 cal. 1, 14-18.) it is for the jury to determine whether the force used was likely to produce great bodily injury. (people v. sargent (1999) 19 cal.4th 1206, 1221; people v. armstrong (1992) 8 cal.app.4th 1060, 1066; people v. rupert (1971) 20 cal.app.3d 961, 968.) moreover, here, an attack was justified in finding an assault by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury.

(1989) 207 cal.app.3d 1157, 1162; people v. rupert, supra, 20 cal.app.3d at p. 968; people v. chavez (1968) 268 cal.app.2d 381, 384; people v. hamilton (1968) 258 cal.app.2d 511, 518; people v. hahn (1956) 147 cal.app.2d 308, 311; people v. kinman (1955) 134 cal.app.2d 419, 420-422; people v. score (1941) 48 cal.app.2d 4 495, 496-499; see people v. armstrong, supra, 8 cal.app.4th at p. 1066; people v. allen (1963) 220 cal.app.2d 796, 801; people v. schmidt (1944) 66 cal.app.2d 253, 255-256.) defendant repeatedly punched the victim in his face, chest, back and neck. a few days later, bruising was still visible. substantial evidence supported the verdict. b. presentence custody credit defendant was awarded credit for 360 days in presentence custody plus 54 days of conduct credit for a total of 414 days. defendant contends he received insufficient presentence custody credit. the attorney general agrees. defendant was arrested on may 19, 2011, and sentenced on may 14, 2012. therefore, he was entitled to 362 days of custody credit plus 54 days of conduct credit for a total of 416 days.
