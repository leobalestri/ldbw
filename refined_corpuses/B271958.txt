[p]risoners with high classification scores will be sent to the prisons with higher levels of security. (in re jenkins (2010) 50 cal.4th 1167, 1174.) 6 mr. subia concluded defendant did not unreasonable risk of dangerto public safety. he opined that style in prison was predictable because without gang involvement, defendant had very few options to ensure his day-to-day safety in prison. the expert testified corrections personnel previously almost uniformly dictated gang association on some level. that culture changed in recent years due to several court decisions. the expert population as a response to those decisions and the recognition there has to be direct mr. subia also explained there are department of corrections rules prison is going to be required to follow whatever rules have been established by their particular race. . . . some of the rules being assist southern hispanics whether a gang member or not. failure to do so could result in discipline by the southern hispanic according to the expert, defendant was assaulted by a group of inmates and retaliated, killing a fellow inmate. he pleaded guilty to manslaughter. he retaliated because had he not done so, would have been the target of his own prison faction for being labeled weak. after that incident, defendant possessed weapons because he became a target. mr. subia was of the 7 b. trial court decision the trial judge issued a comprehensive memorandum of decision, addressing the statutory criteria in section 1170.126, subdivision (g). his written decision discussed the evidence detailed above, i.e., disciplinary record while incarcerated, rehabilitative programming, classification score, age, gang involvement, and post-release plans. the memorandum did not discuss evidence the judge did not rely on in reaching his decision. the trial criminal history and his failure to ever successfully complete a parole. these facts, the judge nd relevant concerns only if other evidence in the record provide[d] a nexus between [defendast and his current the trial gang involvement while incarcerated, his prison disciplinary history and the dearth of rehabilitative programs. deprison [d] serious rule-breaking behavior and are probative of recidivist tendencies and moreover, defendant did not engage in any substance abuse programming or take classes in anger management or violence prevention while incarcerated. the trial would typically be a factor indicating that he no longer poses an 8 declined opportunities to debrief from gang membership and participate in the step down program, designed to assist gang members upon their release from custody. his classification the trial -release particularly because they did not include discussion the people have the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that a petitioner seeking recall of his sentence under proposition 36 poses an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. (people v. superior court (kaulick) (2013) 215 cal.app.4th 1279, 1305.) while this appeal has been pending, the supreme court proposition 36 petitions to recall sentences under the three strikes law. (people v. valencia (july 3, 2017, s233402) __ cal.5th __.) as previously noted, defendant presented no evidence in the proposition 47 hearing. in the proposition 36 hearing, however, he presented the report and testimony of expert subia. decision under an abuse of discretion standard. ( 1170.126, subds. (f), (g).)4 4 citing people v. carmony (2004) 33 cal.4th 367 (carmony), the attorney general and defendant agree the abuse of discretion 9 in carmony, the supreme court described the discretion standard: [t]he burden is on the party attacking the sentence to clearly show that the sentencing decision was irrational or arbitrary. [citation.] in the absence of such a showing, the trial court is presumed to have acted to achieve the legitimate sentencing objectives, and its discretionary determination to impose a particular sentence will not be set aside on review. [citations.] second, a reversed merely because reasonable people might disagree. an appellate tribunal is neither authorized nor warranted in substituting its judgment for the judgment of the trial judge. [citations.] taken together, these precepts establish that a trial court does not abuse its discretion unless its decision is so irrational or arbitrary that no reasonable person could agree with it.carmony, supra, 33 cal.4th at pp. 376-377.) defendant argues the trial court abused its discretion because it did not address expert , defendant late,defendant. these standard applies here. we concur, and note courts of appeal are of the same mind. the supreme court granted review in a number of those published opinions, however, and deferred briefing pending its decision in people v. valencia, supra, __ cal.5th __. (see, e.g., people v. buford (2016) 4 cal.app.5th 886, 895, review granted jan. 11, 2017, s238790; people v. sledge (2015) 235 cal.app.4th 1191, 1193, review granted july 8, 2015, s226449; people v. davis (2015) 234 cal.app.4th 1001, 1018, review granted june 10, 2015, s225603; people v. aparicio (2015) 232 cal.app.4th 1065, 1069, review granted march 25, 2015, s224317.) 10 arguments demonstrate that reasonable persons disagree. they are insufficient, however, to reverse a decision under an abuse of discretion standard. (carmony, supra, 33 cal.4th at p. 377.) tdefendant would constitute an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety if resentenced was n(carmony, supra, 33 cal.4th at p. 377.) there is no basis for reversal. 11 disposition the order denying defendans petition for recall of sentence is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports dunning, j. we concur: kriegler, acting p. j. baker, j. judge of the superior court of the county of orange, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
