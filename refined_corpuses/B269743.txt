(b)-(j), 1170.12, subds. (a)-(d)).2 defendant was sentenced to four years in state prison, consisting of the low term of two years, doubled due to the prior strike conviction. the trial court ordered defendant to pay restitution to the victim in the amount of $2,246.11 plus 10 percent interest, including $250 for reprogramming the defendant contends there is insufficient evidence to support the portion of the restitution order awarding the victim $250 to reprogram the garage door and gates. we conclude substantial evidence supports the restitution order and therefore affirm. factual and procedural summary3 on october 30, 2015, defendant burglarized the garage of roy padgett, taking sunglasses missing from the car. defendant drove the car 350 miles, using a tank of gas on his drive. defendant also damaged the body of the car. after the burglary, padgett changed the locks on his home and had his garage doors and gates reprogrammed. padgett filled out a victim restitution form, listing his losses. the list included the $250 expense of reprogramming the garage door and gates, the only item in dispute on 1 statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise stated. 2 an additional charge of driving or taking a vehicle (veh. code,  10851, subd. (a)) was dismissed. 3 because defendant entered his no contest plea before the preliminary hearing, we take the facts as stated in the probation report. 3 garage doors lic 828098 661-274-4297 est [] garage doors programmed 125.00 gates repr a restitution hearing was held after defendant declined to accept the amount requested by the prosecutor. padgett testified to specific losses he incurred as a result of ng the locks on his home, a missing pair of sunglasses, auto body damage to his car, mileage put on his car, and gas. padgett did not specifically testify to reprogramming his garage doors and gates, but he did testify that the victim restitution form he filled out was accurate. this form was admitted into evidence without objection by defendant. after reviewing the evidence, the court awarded padgett $2,246 in restitution, including the $250 for reprogramming the garage door and gates, which defendant disputes on appeal. discussion standard of review the standard of review for a restitution order is abuse of discretion. (people v. millard (2009) 175 cal.app.4th 7, 26 (millard); people v. akins (2005) 128 cal.app.4th 1376, 1382 (akins).in determining the amount of restitution, all that is required is that the trial court use a rational method that could reasonably be said to make the victim whole, and may not make an order which is arbitrary or capricious. (people v. thygesen [(1990) 69 cal.app.4th 988,] 992; see in re brian s. (1982) 130 cal.app.3d 523.) the order must be affirmed if there is a factual and rational basis for the amount. (people v. dalvito (1997) 56 cal.app.4th 557, 562.) (akins, supra, at p. 1382.) in reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence [to support a factual finding], the power of the appellate court begins and ends with a determination as to whether there is any substantial evidence, contradicted or uncontradicted, to support the trial courts findings. [citations.] further, the standard of proof at a restitution hearing is by a preponderance 4 of the evidence, not proof beyond a reasonable doubt. [citation.] if the circumstances reasonably justify the [trial courts] findings, the judgment may not be overturned when the circumstances might also reasonably support a contrary finding. [citation.] we do not reweigh or reinterpret the evidence; rather, we determine whether there is sufficient evidence to support the inference drawn by the trier of fact. [citations.] (people v. baker [(2005)] 126 cal.app.4th [463,] 468-469.) (millard, supra, at p. 26.) analysis defendant contends that the restitution award should be reduced by $250 for the expense of reprogramming the garage door and gates, claiming that this part of the award was not supported by substantial evidence at the restitution hearing. we disagree. the california constitution gives crime victims a right to restitution and, consequently, requires a court to order a convicted wrongdoer to pay restitution in every case in which a crime victim suffers a loss. (cal. const., art. i,  28, subd. (b)(13)(b).) to implement this requirement, section 1202.4, subdivision (f), generally provides that in every case in which a victim has suffered economic loss as a result of the defendants conduct, the court shall require that the defendant make restitution to the victim or victims in an amount established by court order, based on the amount of loss claimed by the victim or victims or any other showing to the court. (people v. sy (2014) 223 cal.app.4th 44, 62.) to fully reimburse the victim . . . for every determined economic loss incurred as the the value of damaged property. the value of stolen or damaged property shall be the replacement cost of like property, or the actual cost of repairing the property when repair as victim restitution is required under both the regard is in fixing the amount of tpeople v. rowland (1997) 51 cal.app.4th 1745, 1751.) 5 are given virtually unlimited discretion as to the kind of information they can consider people v. baumann (1985) 176 people v. foster (1993) 14 cal.app.4th 939, 947, superseded by statute on another ground as noted in millard, supra, 175 cal.app.4th at p. 42.) section 1202.4 does not require that a sentencing judge must look to any particular kind of proof to establish the value of the loss a victim suffered. (people v. lehman (2016) 247 cal.app.4th 795, 801; people v. gemelli (2008) 161 cal.app.4th 1539, 1542-1543 (gemelliof an item without a supporting receipt (see people v. prosser (2007) 157 cal.app.4th 682, pp. 690-691 (prossersee gemelli, supra, at p. 1543). or other claim or statement of, the millard, supra, 175 cal.app.4th at p. 26, italics shifts to the defendant to demonstrate that the amount of the loss is other than that prosser, supra, 157 cal.app.4th at pp. 690-691.) here, padgett submitted a statement of loss. he testified the statement was accurate. the statement was admitted as an exhibit. defendant presented no evidence at trial to refute the $250 loss related to the garage door and gates, and he tenders no argument on appeal that the loss was not suffered. the trial court acted well within its considerable discretion in awarding the $250 requested, and substantial evidence supports that determination. nothing more is required to affirm the award. 6 disposition the judgment is affirmed. kriegler, j. we concur: turner, p.j. kumar, j. judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
