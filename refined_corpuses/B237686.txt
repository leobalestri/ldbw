filed 1/28/13 p. v. lewis ca2/4 not to be published in the official reports california rules of court, rule 8.1115(a), prohibits courts and parties from citing or relying on opinions not certified for publication or ordered published, except as specified by rule 8.1115(b). this opinion has not been certified for publication or ordered published for purposes of rule 8.1115. in the court of appeal of the state of california second appellate district division four the people, plaintiff and respondent, v. william joseph lewis, defendant and appellant. b237686 (los angeles county super. ct. no. ya081051) appeal from a judgment of the superior court of los angeles county, eric c. taylor, judge. affirmed as modified. kimberly howland meyer, under appointment by the court of appeal, for defendant and appellant. kamala d. harris, attorney general, dane r. gillette, chief assistant attorney general, lance e. winters, assistant attorney general, victoria b. wilson and chung l. mar, deputy attorneys general, for plaintiff and respondent. 2 upon the denial of his motion to suppress evidence (pen. code,  1538.5), defendant william joseph lewis pleaded no contest to one count of possession of a controlled substance (health and saf. code,  11350, subd. (a)) and admitted three prior conviction allegations (id. at  11370, subds. (a), (c)). the trial court entered judgment and, after suspending the imposition of sentence, placed defendant on probation pursuant to proposition 36. defendant contends on appeal that his suppression motion should have been granted because he was unlawfully detained and searched in violation of the fourth amendment. we conclude the trial court properly denied the suppression motion. however, the sentence must be modified because the court miscalculated the conduct credits to which defendant was entitled and failed to impose a mandatory fine. as modified, the judgment is affirmed. background i. the evidence at the hearing on the suppression motion, torrance police officer tyrone gribben testified as follows: at about noon on may 9, 2011, gribben was on patrol with his partner when he saw defendant standing near a motorcycle that was parked illegally on the sidewalk in front of a motel. gribben was familiar with the area because he had made over 50 arrests gribben walked over to defendant and initiated a conversation about the motorcycle, which defendant admitted was hisdisplay a weapon or tell defendant he could not leave. he might have told defendant the motorcycle was parked illegally. he residence, occupation, prior record, medications, and possession of anything illegal. 3 encounter, which was recorded,1 gribben was concerned about his safety. his concerns were based on his knowledge of the location and the number of armed individuals he had sually nervous demeanor which indicated he was manner in which defendant was fidgeting with his hands, looking away, and . . experiences in and around that area, specifically that hotel, and the fact that i was there investigating the motorcycle parked on the sidewalk, i detained mr. lewis and decided, based on all those things before, that i was going to conduct a pat-down search on him for at that point, defendant was detained and told to place his hands behind his head while gribben patted his waistband and found no weapons. gribben inquired whether he t here, spread ft object and a larger hard object, which 1 at the suppression hearing, neither party introduced the audio recording of 4 he believed might be some type of folding knife or small gun.2 gribben asked defendant what he had in his pocket, and defendant mentioned a pack of cigarettes and a zip-up case for an earpiece. gribben reached inand . . . a hard black zip- -up case and found a white substance that resembled rlooked in there, and he indicated that he did not mind, and i conducted a search of its after defendant admitted the rock cocaine was his, gribben asked why he had allowed him to search inside the defendant was arrested for a narcotics violation but was not cited for a vehicle code violation. ii. the arguments and ruling below the prosecution argued below that the detention, patsearch, and search inside the zip-up case were lawful for the following reasons: the initial encounter was consensual. t was obscuring for weapons violations, gribben became legitimately concerned that defendant might be armed and dangerous. accordingly, it was lawful for gribben to detain defendant and pat that might be a weapon, gribben lawfully removed the suspicious object to ensure his 2 acknowledged the item was soft when he manipulated it. however, he went on to state, one end, and there was something else on there that was fairly large. it 5 efore opening the hard zip-up case and examining its contents.3 defendant argued, on the other hand, that because the detention was unlawful, the the encounter and the detention became unlawful when it was unduly prolonged beyond the time reasonably necessary to cite him for a simple parking violation. in addition, he argued the search inside the zip-up case was not consensual. after a lengthy hearing that consumed several court sessions, the trial court found the detention and searches leading to the discovery of the controlled substance were lawful. it therefore denied the suppression motion. although the record does not contain a written order setting forth the court indicated that gribben was a credible witness and that the detention and patsearch were lawful. the court then turned to the final question, whether defendant had consented to the search of the zip-up case. although earlier the court had indicated the search of the zip-up case was not consensual, the court now expressed the opposite words that you have read to me and the way that they were read to me they are they are certainly a good argument that your client consented to search after the pouch was out the search of the zip-up case was consensual. contest plea, the court entered judgment and, after suspending the imposition of sentence, placed him on probation for six months under proposition 36. this timely appeal followed. 3 that the search was conducted incident to arrestwill not be discussed because it is not necessary to our determination of the appeal. 6

(people v. mcgaughran, supra, 25 cal.3d at p. 583.) the evidence reasonably showed, however, that defendant was not detained until midway through the four-minute encounter when his unusually nervous behavior caused gribben, who could not see his waistband and had arrested others at the same location for weapons violations, to suspect he might be armed and dangerous. we disagree that the detention was unduly prolonged. as discussed below, the evidence, when viewed in the 8 justifiable suspicion that he was carrying a concealed weapon. iii. the patsearch was lawful defendant contends the patsearch was unlawful because the circumstances did not support a reasonable suspicion that he was carrying a weapon. we are not persuaded. a. patsearches generally when an officer reasonably suspects that an individual whose suspicious behavior he or she is investigating is armed and dangerous to the officer or others, he or she may perform a patsearch for weapons. (terry v. ohio, supra, 392 u.s. at pp. 24, 30; giovanni b. v. superior court (2007) 152 cal.app.4th 312, 320; people v. dickey (1994) 21 cal.app.4th 952, 955-956; people v. garcia (2006) 145 cal.app.4th 782, 786.) the sole justification for the search is the protection of the officer and others nearby, and the search must therefore be confined in scope to an intrusion reasonably designed to discover weapons. (terry v. ohio, supra, upon the sanctity of the person, which may inflict great indignity and arouse strong id. at p. 17, fn. omitted.) on the other hand, law enforcement officers have a legitimate need to protect themselves even where they may lack probable cause for an arrest. (id. at p. 24.) the officer has an id. at p. 23.) specific and articulable facts which, considered in conjunction with rational inferences to be drawn therefrom, give rise to a reasonable suspicion that the suspect is armed and people v. medina [(2003)] 110 cal.app.4th [171,] 176; see ybarra v. illinois (1979) 444 u.s. 85, 92-93; see terry v. ohio, supra, 392 u.s. at p. 21; people v. lindsey (2007) 148 cal.app.4th 1390, 1395-1396; people v. lopez (2004) 119 cal.app.4th 132, 135; people v. dickey, supra, 21 cal.app.4th at p. 956; people v. 9 miranda (1993) 17 cal.app.4th 917, 927 [minor traffic offenses do not reasonably suggest the presence of weapons, and an officer may not search a driver unless the objective circumstances furnish reasonable grounds to believe the driver is armed or dangerous and may gain immediate control of a weapon].) of the issue is whether a reasonably prudent person in the totality of the circumstances people v. avila (1997) 58 cal.app.4th 1069, 1074; see terry v. ohio, supra, 392 u.s. at p. 27.) nferences about illinois v. wardlow [(2000)] 528 u.s. [119,] 125.) the determination -people v. durazo [(2004)] 124 cal.app.4th [728,] 735.) an inchoate and unparticularized suspicion or hunch is not sufficient, nor is the fact the officer acted in good faith. (terry v. ohio, supra, at pp. 22, 27.) where specific and articulable facts are absent, the patsearch cannot be upheld. (people v. dickey, supra, 21 cal.app.4th at p. 956.) whether a search is reasonable must be determined based upon the circumstances known to the officer when the search was conducted. (in re jaime p. in re h.m. (2008) 167 cal.app.4th 136, 143-144.) b. the finding that the patsearch was justified is supported by substantial evidence in this case, the trial court found the patsearch was justified because (1) the officer had made over 50 arrests at that same location for narcotics, stolen vehicles, firearms, and he was fidgeting with his hands, looking away, and sweating continuouslycaused him to seem unusually nervous for a person who had committed a simple parking violation; and (3) the officer could not see defe reasonableness of a patsearch for weapons. in in re h.m., supra, 167 cal.app.4th 136, 10 for example, the court stated: we conclude the trial court correctly held the detective had a reasonable suspicion h.m. was armed. h.m. was not stopped solely because he committed a minor traffic violation. h.m. was also stopped because of his unusual, suspicious behavior. magallon observed h.m. dashing through heavy traffic, causing as he ran suggested he was frightened and fleeing from a dangerous situation. the fact he was sweating profusely and appeared confused and nervous reinforced this impression. nervous, evasive behavior is a pertinent factor in determining reasonable suspicion. (illinois v. wardlow, supra, 528 u.s. at p. 124.) viewed objectively, through the lens of common sense and criminal activity was afoot. indeed, we can conceive of few hypotheses explaining in re h.m., supra, 167 cal.app.4th at p. 144.) similarly, defendant in this case was not detained simply because of a parking violation, but because he was nervously fidgeting, sweating continuously, and looking away, and the location was one in which gribben had made several arrests for firearms offenses. the fact that defendant was standing next to a motorcycle that was parked illegally on the sidewalk in a high crime area was a legitimate factor in assessing the reasonableness of the patsearch. to be sure, the mere fact a person is located in a high-crime area when stopped by police does not, by itself, give rise to a reasonable suspicion that the individual is armed. (illinois v. wardlow, supra, area of expected criminal activity, standing alone, is not enough to support a reasonable, people v. perrusquia (2007) 150 cal.app.4th 228, 233; people v. medina, supra, 110 cal.app.4th at p. 177.) nonetheless, the character of the locale where the stop occurs is a factor to be considered characteristics of a location in determining whether the circumstances are sufficiently suspicious to warrant further investigation. accordingly, . . . the fact that the stop 11 terry illinois v. wardlow, supra, at p. 124; see also people v. souza [(1994)] consideration in assessing whether an investigative detention is reasonable under the people v. medina, supra, in re h.m., supra, 167 cal.app.4th at p. 145.) given that gribben had arrested other armed individuals near the same motel, he was justifiably concerned for his safety when defendant, who was wearing a large shirt that covered his waistband, exhibited unusually nervous behavior under the circumstances. we conclude the trial court correctly determined that the patsearch was defendant argues the removal of the soft objects from his pocket was unlawful. and that he thought the hard object might be a folding knife or small gun. the objects n at the hearing, and the trial court, which had an opportunity to observe both objects, found his testimony was credible. the primary reason for deferring to the trial courconflicting evidence will necessarily depend upon the relative credibility of the witnesses offering that evidence. the trier of fact is the sole judge of that credibility (estate of teel (1944) 25 cal.2d 520, 526), because only the trier of fact has the opportunity to observe and hear the witnesses. by contrast, an appellate court has nothing but the cold written hesitations, their doubts, their variations of language, their precipitancy, their calmness or consideration. a witness may convince all who hear him testify that he is disingenuous and untruthful, and yet his testimony, when read, may convey a most favorable maslow v. maslow (1953) 117 cal.app.2d 237, 243, overruled on another 12 ground in liodas v. sahadi people v. jackson (1992) 10 cal.app.4th 13, 20-21.) iv. the finding that defendant consented to the search of the case is supported by substantial evidence e. as previously mentioned, based on our reading of the transcript, we infer the trial court found that defendant had consented to the search of the case. gribben testified that after discovering the white substance inside the case, he asked why defendant had agreed to let him search the case. gribben asked whether defendant this testimony, which the court found credible, reasonably supports a finding that the search of the case was consensual. the trial court miscalculated the number of conduct credits and failed to impose a mandatory $30 fine pursuant to government code section 70373, subdivision (a)(1). defendant does not dispute either contention. we conclude the attorney general is correct and we will remedy the error. (people v. smith (2001) 24 cal.4th 849, 854 [unauthorized sentence may be corrected at any time whether or not objection was lodged in the trial court].) the trial court gave defendant credit for three days of custody time and three days of conduct credit. this was er13 language, the court in people v. smith (1989) 211 cal.app.3d 523, 527, observed: as defendant served only three days in custody, he was entitled to no conduct credits.4 government corelevant here. the amount of the fine is $30 for each felony or misdemeanor conviction. the trial court did not impose the fine, thus resulting in an unauthorized sentence. (people v. rodriguez (2000) 80 cal.app.4th 372, 376.) disposition the judgment is modified to reflect that defendant is entitled to no presentence conduct credits and is required to pay a $30 fine pursuant to government code section 70373, subdivision (a)(1). not to be published in the official reports suzukawa, j. we concur: epstein, p. j. willhite, j. 4 the attorney general also incorrectly calculated the conduct credits, concluding defendant was entitled to two days.
