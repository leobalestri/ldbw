(see  1385; people v. superior court (romero) (1996) 13 cal.4th 497.) broussard subsequently pleaded no contest to one count of second degree robbery. he also admitted one of the prior serious or violent felony allegations under the three strikes law (the one for carjacking), both allegations under section 667, subdivision (a)(1), and two of the prior prison term allegations under section 667.5, subdivision (b). at the time he entered his plea, broussard was advised of his constitutional rights and the nature and consequences of the plea, which he stated he understood. counsel for broussard joined in the waivers of his constitutional rights. the trial court found that 1 statutory references are to the penal code. 3 waivers, plea, and admissions were voluntary, knowing and intelligent. the trial court sentenced broussard in accordance with the negotiated plea agreement to an aggregate state prison term of 22 years, consisting of 10 years for second degree robbery (the upper term of five years, doubled under the three strikes law), plus 10 years for the two enhancements under section 667, subdivision (a)(1), and two years for the two enhancements under section 667.5, subdivision (b). the court awarded broussard presentence custody credits and imposed various fines, fees, and assessments. the court dismissed the other serious or violent felony allegations under the three strikes law. broussard filed a notice of appeal in which he checked the preprinted box indicating his appeal was or other matters occurring after the plea that do not affect the broussard stated he was also challenging the plea. in his request for a certificate of probable cause, which the trial court denied, broussard indicated term of incarceration for a second strike felony which had been we appointed counsel to represent broussard on appeal. after reviewing the record, counsel filed an opening brief raising no issues. we subsequently advised broussard he had 30 days to file a supplemental brief raising any contentions or issues he wanted us to consider. although we granted broussard two extensions of time, he never filed a supplemental brief. 4 discussion a criminal defendant who appeals without a certificate of probable cause following a plea of no contest or guilty can only challenge a denial of a motion to suppress evidence or raise issues arising after the entry of the plea that do not affect the validity of the plea. (cal. rules of court, rule 8.304(b)(1).) to the extent broussard is seeking to challenge the validity of his plea and the sentence the trial court imposed as part of his plea, he cannot do so without a certificate of probable cause. (see people v. buttram (2003) 30 cal.4th 773, 781; people v. hoffard (1995) 10 cal.4th 1170, 1173; people v. stubbs (1998) 61 cal.app.4th 243, 245; cal. rules of court, rule 8.304(b)(3).) with respect to other potential sentencing or post-plea issues that do not in substance challenge the validity of the plea, we have examined the record and are satisfied appellate counsel for broussard has fully complied with his responsibilities and there are no arguable issues.
