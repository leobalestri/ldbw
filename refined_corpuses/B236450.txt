( 667, subds. (b)-(i); 667, subd. (a)(1); 667.5, subd. (b).) the court subsequently granted durens motion to strike one of the prior strike findings. (people v. superior court (romero) (1996) 13 cal.4th 497.) the trial court sentenced duren to 9 years in state prison as follows: on the aggravated assault conviction: the high term of 4 years, doubled for a strike to 8 years, plus 1 year for a prior conviction with a prison term. the trial court imposed a concurrent 6-month term for the misdemeanor battery conviction, to be served in any facility. no term was imposed pursuant to section 667, subdivision (a)(1). we affirm. facts on june 22, 2010, cheryl mcdaniel (the crime victim) walked to a local store to purchase beer for a family get-together. outside the store, duren approached mcdaniel and asked for money. mcdaniel said no, and went into the store. at the counter, duren walked up to mcdaniel and threw one punch, hitting her in the face, knocking her down and backward. mcdaniel hit her head on the concrete floor. mcdaniels son came upon the scene within minutes of the incident, and took mcdaniel to a hospital where medical tests revealed no abnormalities. mcdaniel was released from the hospital after about one and one-half hours. a few days after the incident, mcdaniel saw duren outside mcdaniels apartment complex. mcdaniel called police, and duren was arrested. 1 all further section references are to the penal code. 3 in late 2010, the people filed an amended information charging duren as follows: felony battery with serious bodily injury (count 1;  243, subd. (d)); and assault by means likely to produce great bodily injury (count 2;  245, subd.
