assault with a firearm in violation of section 245, subdivision (a)(2) (count 2); the making of criminal threats in violation of section 422 (count 3); attempted murder in violation of sections 664 and 187, subdivision (a) (count 4);

elizalde went immediately into her bedroom. ramirez followed her into her 1 all subsequent statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise indicated. 3 bedroom and continued arguing. ramirez struck elizalde once on the forehead with the butt-end of the sawed-the shotgun was loaded because she had seen ramirez load it and she believed that he would kill her. valerie and boy rez told them to leave the room and told ride; valerie, boy, and ramirez left the apartment about 15 minutes later. and boy. elizalde immediately grabbed her keys and went to the pomona police station where she reported what had perez, according to his sister jessica perez (hereinafter of prison . . . borrow her car, a white ford explorer, between 10:30 p.m. and 11:00 p.m. on the evening question, and she had often observed ramirez wearing a green bay packer sweatshirt. jessica testified that her white ford explorer was parked in the driveway in the early morning hours of february 1, 2009, and that she normally parked her car there or by the sidewalk. early on february 1, 2009, perez to put in a load of laundry sometime after midnight. as she was walking into the garage, perez was leaving the garage, and jessica caught a glimpse of ramirez in the garage 4 through the doorway. that was the last time that jessica saw perez alive. ramirez was girlfriend, testified at trial that perez woke her up to have sex. about 15 minutes later avila heard somebody banging on the garage. avila told the . . . or door open. she knew it was the white ford explorer because the car was parked close to the cellular phone rang and he had a conversation with someone. in the police interview, ncertain later;

the last outgoing call perez made was that same minute. -door neighbor, testified at trial that when he wrong side of the street. moreno stated that he only looked at the vehicle for . . . went to the restroom [for] [] . . . individuals, one of whom was wearing a gray sweatshirt that appeared to have the green liexplorer, before leaving the scene. ii. the assault on stark (counts 4 and 5) . . . new who he was [or] . . . a standard gang challenge. stark was shocked and told him that she was just picking up ramirez hit or stabbed her in the face, slicing her face three times on her left jaw 6 e driveway to a residence, but ramirez pulled her and his companion chased ramirez, but lost him. after ramirez ran away, someone that had to be stapled shut. iii. the police interviewed ramirez on september 6, 2009. ramirez stated that he 2 a gang he had been jumped into at 14, after he moved have any other guns. ramirez told the police that he and perez got into an altercation methamphetamines. ramirez had perez drop him off in the alley. perez came back later in the white ford explorer. perez did not have a gun. perez hit ramirez a couple of his green bay packer jacket. when asked if he was angry at perez that morning because after ramirez shot perez, he threw the gun into the bushes and went straight to his -caliber gun by the apartments. 2 smaller gang in the east side 7 when ramirez described his encounter with stark to the police, he said that he . iv. gang evidence interview with the police, including a statement regarding how he was jumped into his gang. given that ramirez stated that stark spoke ill of his gang, the trial court admitted . . . jury that this evidence could only be considered as it related to the issues of motive and intent, but not to show that ramirez is a person of bad character or a person prone to ke for no apparent reason, off goes the defendant . . . a strong motive has now been suggested both by the testimony of [stark] interview with the police ramirez stated that when he was about 14 years old. discussion ramirez contends that: the trial court abused its discretion by granting the jury on use of deadly force in response to an attack with fists, caljic 5.31, misled the jury; he was denied his sixth amendment right to counsel when his counsel failed to request modification of caljic 5.31; the trial court committed a reversible error, which imperfect self-defense with respect to the counts involving ms. stark; and the cumulative 8 effect of the errors that occurred during the trial was the denial of his right to due process and a fair trial. i. the trial court did not abuse its discretion consolidate. abuse of discretion, which requireto the joinder of the cases. (people v. gray (2005), 37 cal.4th 168, 221; see also people v. koontz (2002) 27 cal.4th 1041, 10741075; people v. mason (1991) 52 cal.3d 909, 933935.) under section 954 of the penal code, an accusatory pleading may charge two or more different offenses connected together in their commission, or two or more different offenses of the same class of crimes. ( 954; see people v. soper (2009) 45 cal.4th 759, 771 (soper).) people v. koontz (2002) 27 cal.4th 1041, 1074; people v. mason, supra, 52 cal.3d at p. 935; see  954.) crimes of the same class. (people v. poggi (1988) 45 cal.3d 306, 320 (poggi).) in poggi, the california supreme court held that joinder of the following charges against different victims was proper because they were assaultive crimes against the person: robbery, rape, murder, and assault with a deadly weapon. (ibid.) consolidation also is the way that the crimes were executed. (people v. lucky (1988) 45 cal.3d 259, 276.) 9 murder, assault with a firearm, making criminal threats,3 and attempted murderare assaultive crimes against the person. during ommission of each of these crimes, he referred to his gang affiliation. in ghetto . . . guns and a knifeproperly subject to consolidation as crimes of the same class and offenses sharing certain characteristics. we next consider whether ramirez was prejudiced by the consolidation by applying a factor test. (see alcala v. superior court (2008) 43 cal.4th 1205, 12201221.) the first factor considered is the cross-admissibility of the evidence in separate trials. (ibidnot be cross--r soper, supra, 45 cal.4th at p. 775.) in assessing the the charges are particularly likely to inflame the jury against the defendant; (2) whether a weak case has been joined with a strong case or another weak case so that the totality of the evidence may alter the outcome as to some or all of the charges; or (3) whether one of the charges (but not another) is a capital offense, or the joinder of the charges converts ibida motion to sever is correct at the time it was made, a reviewing court still must 3 doe v. saenz (2006) 140 cal.app.4th 960, 986the criminal threatit was a crime against the person. 10 determine whether, in the end, the joinder of counts or defendants for trial resulted in id. at p. der [rises] to the level of a constitutional violation only if it results in united states v. lane (1986) 474 u.s. 438, 446, fn. 8.) ramirez argues, and respondent does not dispute, that there was no cross-admissible evidence. although cross-admissibility may be an influential consideration non people v. geier (2007) 41 cal.4th 555, 575.-ibid.) thus, the lack of cross-admissible evidence, standing alone, is not sufficient to require was likely to unduly inflame a jury soper, supra, 45 cal.4th at p. 780), the risk of inflaming the jury against the defendant is not present. (see people v. cook (2006) 39 cal.4th 566, 582 (cook).) in cook, the court held that three sibid.) in soper, supra, 45 cal.4th 759, the court held that homicides sufficiently similar in nature are unlikely to unduly inflame a jury against the defendant. far more egregious than the murder and assault charges in the elizalde-ramirez argues that stark was unknown to him and his assault of her was a random, unusvictims in the elizalde and perez crimes, and argued with each victim before he 11 committed the crimes. he also contends that he used a different weapon during the commission of the crimes, that gang undertones were present in the stark offense but not attack inflamed the jury against him. in support of his contention, ramirez cites the people v. harris (1998) 60 cal.app.4th 727 (harris). unlike this case, the controlling issue in harris could result iharris, supra, 60 cal.app.4th at p. 730.) the court found that the trial court erred in admitting prior crime evidence that allowed the jury to hear evidence that 23 years earlier, the defendant had been paroled for a prior from sex offenses involving two women who were patients where the defendant worked. (id. at pp. 733741.) the harris court reasoned that 23 years between parole and a g and fondling two women, of whom one was incapacitated and the other was his former sexual partner, and both of whom remained on speaking terms with him. (id. at pp. 738739.) even assuming harris applies here, ramirez committed the crimes against perez and elizalde only six months before he attacked stark. also, all the charges against ramirez involve violence and deadly weapons, which resulted in the death of perez and could have resulted in the deaths of stark and elizalde. respondent correctly observes, in each case, a difference that does not render the crimes meaningfully different in type. therefore, neither charge can be readily found to inflame the otherwas evidence that ramirez threatened perez using territorial threats when he shouted, . . . the stark assault, he asked her, 12 the jury convicted ramirez of attempted murder of stark. thus, there is no basis to conclude that the consolidation of the charges against ramirez posed a risk of inflaming the jury against him. we also conclude that joinder did not bolster a weak case. ven if it is circumstantial, joinder people v. zambrano (2007) 41 cal.4th 1082, 1130, overruled on other grounds in people v. doolin (2009) 45 cal.4th 390, 421, all involve violence, the use of deadly weapons, gang-great amount of circumstantial evidence including witness testimony and his interview with the police, and the stark assa the possibility that ramirez killed perez in self-defense. we disagree. the evidence of n that it was a murder in the first degree. the jury could reasonably conclude from the evidence that ramirez intentionally lured perez into the that if perez ever retusimply carried out his threat. therefore, as in people v. zambrano[ramirez is responsible for the murder of perez] though circumstantial [(his interview t p. 1130.) ramirez argues that joinder denied him due process. where the cases are supported with enough evidence to have been tried separately, the joinder of unrelated 13 cases and the evidence introduced at trial does not result in gross unfairness. (people v. thomas (2012) 53 cal.4th 771, 799801.) here, the charges against ramirez involved his violent acts against others. there ble and within the bounds of discretion. . . . moreover, viewed in light of the evidence presented at trial, the judgment is not subject to reversal based on any unfairness in the joinder ruling that would amount to a denial of due people v. macklem (2007) 149 cal.app.4th 674, 701.) ii. the jury instructions were not erroneous. ramirez asserts that he was prejudiced at trial because his trial counsel did not seek to modify caljic no. 5.31, which states that use of a deadly weapon in response to . . . -defense [because of the possibility rfect self- the judge instructed the jury on perfect and imperfect self-defense consecutively, as well as the use of a deadly weapon in self-defense in response to an attack with fists, in using a deadly weapon in self-defense unless that person believes and a reasonable person in the same or similar circumstances would believe that the assault is likely to and responsive to the evidence was too general or incomplete unless the party has requested appropriate clarifying or amppeople v. hudson (2006) 38 cal.4th 1002, 10111012.) ramirez argues his counsel was ineffective because he failed to object or request modification of caljic 5.31. ined from the entire charge of the court, not from consideration of parts of an instruction or from a particular people v. carrington (2009) 47 cal.4th 145, 192.) we assume that it is 14 id. at p. 192.) reversal based on an instruction or a part thereof is not warranted, even if that instruction combined with the arguments of couns(people v. jaspar (2002) 98 cal.app.4th 99, 111.) reasonable and unreasonable self-defense. the jury instructions on self-defense were done in the actual but unreasonable belief in the necessity to defend against imminent peril to life or great bodily injury, the offense is manslaughter. in that case, even if the intent to kill exists, the law is that malice, which is an essential element of murder, is find ramirez guilty of voluntary manslaughter, with respect to the killing of perez. the undue weight or stress on that particular instruction. the instructions are considered as a was instructed on perfect and imperfect self-defense claims in immediate succession. we assume that the jury correctly interpreted and understood the instructions on imperfect self-defense in immediate comparison and juxtaposition to the perfect self-defense instruction. thus, the jury was able to make the critical distinction between the concepts of reasonable and unreasonable self-defense. -defense were confusing and misleading is meritless. the jury instructions adequately addressed both concepts with clarity, and the defense counsel explained the concepts in depth -defense is justifiable and not unlawful when the person who does the killing asuffer great bodily injury at the hands of the other person. counsel then described imperfect/unreasonable self-unreasonable belief thagreat bodily injury kills unlawfully but does not harbor malice aforethought, is not guilty 15 of murder [] . . . [] . . . in other words, if you feel that the action out there was unreasonable, okay, but that there was a danger . . . the jury could acquit ramirez if it found perfect self-defense, and find him guilty of voluntary manslaughter if it found imperfect self-defense. thus, there is no reason to believe that the jury could have misunderstood the defense theories. the jury instructions were not erroneous. that his counsel was ineffective for failing to object or to request modification to caljic regarding claims of ineffective assistance of counsel is settled. (people v. castillo (1997) 16 cal.4th 1009, 10141015 (castillo), citing strickland v. washington (1984) 466 u.s. 668, 687, 693694 [104 s.ct. 2052, 80 l.ed.2d 674].) claims of ineffective assistance of counsel arising from instruction issues fail as long as a reasonable juror would understand the instructions and the instructions did not hinder counsel in effectively arguing. (castillo, at p. 1017.) therefore need not consider whether any error prejudiced ramirez, and we reject his claim that he was denied effective assistance of counsel. iii. -defense as to the counts involving ms. stark did not deny ramirez his rights to due process. self-defense with respect to the charges pertaining to the stark incident denied him due process, a fair trial, and the right to present a defense. revidence to get to unreasonable self-fect self-defense resulted in prejudice is subject to the harmless error test articulated in people v. watson (1956) 46 cal.2d 818, 836. (people v. blakely (2000) 23 cal.4th 82, 93.) 16 -defense doctrineapplicable where a defendant reasonably believes that his safety is endangeredmay not be invoked by a defendant who, through his own wrongful conduct (e.g., the initiation of a physical assault or the commission of a felony), has created circumstances under which his in re christian s. (1994) 7 cal.4th 768, 773, fn. 1; but see people v. randle (2005) 35 cal.4th 987, 10011003, overruled on other grounds in people v. chun (2009) 45 cal.4th 1172, 1201.) however, the defense remains available where the defendant is responsible for the circumstances defendant is unlawful. (randle, at pp. 10021003.) specifically, a person only has the right to defend themselves or their property as long as the threat to themselves or their property persists. (ibid.) in randle, there was excessive force by the victim. in this case, the absence of excessive force by the victim, stark, lies at the heart of the trial -defense instructions,] even absent request if there is some substantial evidence, i.e., nontrivial, substantial evidence. as to tto self-slapped, to which his use of deadly force was not justifiable as a matter of law. the court also stated there was not sufficient evidence to instruct the jury on unreasonable self-bad starks version of events, there was not substantial evidence justifying an instruction on 17 imperfect self-defense, as ramirez never stated that he actually believed he was in imminent peril to life or great bodily injury. thus, ramirez was not entitled to an imperfect self-defense instruction as to his attack on stark, so the trial court did not err in violated.4 disposition the judgment is affirmed. not for publication. johnson, j. we concur: mallano, p. j. chaney, j. 4 because we conclude that there were no errors on appeal, we do not address whether ramirez is entitled to a reversal based on the cumulative effect of errors.
