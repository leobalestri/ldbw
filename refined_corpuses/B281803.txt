 filed 6/25/18 p. v. martinez ca2/4 not to be published in the official reports california rules of court, rule 8.1115(a), prohibits courts and parties from citing or relying on opinions not certified for publication or ordered published, except as specified by rule 8.1115(b). this opinion has not been certified for publication or ordered published for purposes of rule 8.1115. in the court of appeal of the state of california second appellate district division four the people, plaintiff and respondent, v. fabian martinez, defendant and appellant. b281803 (los angeles county super. ct. no. ta132641) appeal from a judgment of the superior court of los angeles county, tammy chung ryu, judge. affirmed as modified. jeanine g. strong, under appointment by the court of appeal, for defendant and appellant. xavier becerra, attorney general, gerald a. engler, chief assistant attorney general, lance e. winters, assistant attorney general, shawn mcgahey webb and analee j. brodie, deputy attorneys general, for plaintiff and respondent. 2 introduction appellant calculation of his presentence custody credits. the parties dispute the appropriate inferences to be made from the minimal record before the court. appellant asserts the trial court abused its discretion in failing to award 70 days of conduct credit, arguing there was insufficient evidence to find that he was committed to a state hospital as mentally incompetent for that amount of time. we find no error apparent from the record before appellant also asserts that he is entitled to one additional day of actual custody credit. we agree that the record suggests the trial court erred in awarding 394 days of actual custody credit, rather than 395. background i. procedural background on september 30, 2014, appellant was charged by information with one count of arson of property of another (pen. code,  451, subd. (d)).1 appellant pled not guilty. appellant later withdrew his plea and entered a plea of guilty. the court ac on june 24, 2015, the court suspended the imposition of sentence and placed appellant on formal probation for five years. appellant violated probation in september 2015. the court revoked his probation, but ultimately reinstated it under the same terms and conditions. appellant violated probation a second time and was taken into custody on january 30, 2017. 1 all further statutory references herein are to the penal code unless otherwise indicated. 3 the court terminated probation and imposed a sentence of three years in state prison on the previously suspended sentence. ii. facts relevant to calculation of credits appellant was arrested on march 17, 2014. according to a probation report, he was sent to patton state hospital on june 2, 2014370 pc (mentally incompetent).2 the record does not contain the date of his return to jail or a finding that he was no longer mentally incompetent. appellant contends that he posted bail on october 16, 2014. respondent does not dispute this assertion. appellant remained out of custody until april 22, 2015. on that date, mental competency pursuant to section 1368. the court adjourned criminal proceedings, remanded appellant to custody, and appointed dr. kory knapke to examine appellant. on june 5, 2015, the court stated it had reviewed the report from dr. knapke and found appellant competent to stand trial. on june 24, 2015, the court placed appellant on probation. the court ordered appellant to be conditionally released to the fresh start recovery home, noting that he would be released to that program as soon as a bed was available. the court awarded presentence custody credits totaling 475 days. the court calculated the credits as 203 days actual custody credit, 202 days according to a letter from the fresh start program, appellant was released from jail to the program on july 9, 2015. he remained in the program until leaving on july 21, 2015, in 2 section 1370 sets forth, among other things, the requirements for commitment of a mentally incompetent defendant. 4 violation of his probation. he was at large until his arrest on september 16, 2015. and he was remanded to custody. the court reinstated probation on october 14, 2015 and again ordered appellant released to the fresh start program. he reentered the program on november 24, 2015. appellant remained out of jail and in the fresh start program until sometime in late april or early may 2016. after leaving the program, he remained at large until january 30, 2017, when he surrendered on a bench warrant and was remanded to custody. he remained in custody until he was sentenced on march 2, 2017. at the sentencing hearing, the court noted that appellant the court also stated that asked defense counsel if he knew how much time appellant he does not custody as reflected in the minute order and the abstract of judgment, the court ultimately awarded 394 days of actual custody credit and 324 days of conduct credit, for a total of 718 days of credit. appellant timely appealed. discussion presentence custody credits. appellant contends he was entitled 5 to one additional day of actual custody and 70 additional days of conduct credit, for a total of 789 days instead of the 718 awarded by the court. i. standard of review appellant argues that this issue involves application of uestion of law subject to our independent review. we disagree. in the cases cited by appellant, the issue before the court was the legal application of a statute to undisputed facts. (see people v. anaya (2007) 158 cal.app.4th 608, 611 [applying de novo review to question of whether defendant statute while he wore an electronic home monitor]; see also people v. ravaux (2006) 142 cal.app.4th 914, 919 (ravaux) custody for the purposes of section 2900.5 while detained by the police prior to being booked into jail is a matter of statutory interpretation, a question of law we review de novo determination of the amount of time appellant spent in custody and corresponding award of presentence credits. indeed, the parties dispute the factual inferences that can be drawn from the substantial evidence. (people v. superior court (jones) (1998) 18 cal.4th 667, 681.) that standard is deferential: courts factual determination is attacked on the ground that there is no substantial evidence to sustain it, the power of an appellate court begins and ends with the determination as to whether, on the entire record, there is substantial evidence, contradicted or uncontradicted, which will support the determination. . . . 6 (ibid.) he very settled rule of appellate review is a s order/judgment is presumed to be correct, error is never presumed, and the appealing party must affirmatively demonstrate error on the face of the record. (people v. davis (1996) 50 cal.app.4th 168, 172.) ii. award of actual custody credits a defendant convicted of a felony is entitled to credit against his or her term of imprisonment for time spent in custody prior to sentencing. ( 2900.5, subd. (a); ravaux, supra, 142 cal.app.4th at p. 919.) he or she is also entitled to earn conduct credits under section 4019at a rate of two days for every two days in presentence custody. (people v. chilelli (2014) 225 cal.app.4th 581, 588.) starting from the date of his arrest, the record reflects that appellant spent the following days in custody up to and including the day of sentencing: march 17, 2014 to october 16, 2014 (214 days); april 22, 2015 to july 9, 2015 (79 days); september 16, 2015 to november 24, 2015 (70 days), and january 30, 2017 to march 2, 2017 (32 days). this totals 395 days, one more than the 394 days of actual custody credit awarded by the trial court. respondent notes that presentence custody credits begin to accrue when the defendant is booked into custody, rather than at the time of his arrest. (see ravaux, supra, 142 cal.app.4th at p. 919; section 2900.5, subd. (a).) here, because the crime occurred g date was different than his arrest date. as such, we conclude appellant is entitled to 395 days of presentence custody credit. 7 iii. award of conduct credits appellant also asserts that he was entitled to an additional 70 days of conduct credit. it appears that the trial court awarded 70 days of custody credit, but withheld a corresponding amount of conduct credit, based on an implied finding that appellant was incompetent and committed to patton for 70 days some time after his arrest. appellant counters that the record lacks substantial evidence to support that conclusion. we disagree. typically, an accused awaiting trial is not statutorily entitled to conduct credits for time spent in a state hospital while subject to a finding of incompetency. (people v. bryant (2009) 174 cal.app.4th 175, 182 (bryant), citing people v. waterman (1986) 42 cal.3d 565, 569; people v. sage (1980) 26 cal.3d 498, 502503.) however, equal protection requires application of section 4019 credits to presentence confinement in a state facility if the circumstances of the confinement are essentially penal. (people v. buckhalter (2001) 26 cal.4th 20, 30, fn. 6; see also bryant, supra, 174 cal.app.4th at pp. 182183.) thus, in bryant, the court granted conduct credits for the time after defendant was declared competent but before he was transferred from the state hospital to the county jail. (id. at p. 184; see also people v. guzman (1995) 40 cal.app.4th 691, 693695 [person entitled to section 4019 credits for time confined at treatment facility but excluded from treatment as unsuitable].) similarly, here, if appellant spent time at the state hospital after he was declared competent, he would be entitled to conduct credits for those days. although the record on appeal is sparse, we find that sconclusion that appellant was committed to patton state hospital for 70 days as 8 commitment to the hospital on june 2, 2014 pursuant to section 1370, the section dealing with commitments based on mental incompetence. a commitment of 70 days would have resulted in the transfer of appellant back to jail in mid-august, 2014. that result is not inconsistent with the record before us, which shows appellant in custody as of the date of his preliminary hearing on september 16, 2014. the trial court referred to appellant having spent 70 days at patton when calculating custody credits at the hearing on june 24, 2015; then, when calculating credits for a second time on march 2, 2017, the court again referred to seeing no objection or correction was raised by defense counsel in response to either of these statements by the court. the court indicated it would review the documents and calculate the conduct credits accordingly. subsequently, the court awarded 324 days of conduct credit, 70 less than the full amount available if appellant had spent the entire time in jail. further, the record also contains several other references to y. first, according to the probation report prepared on september 29, previously hospitalized at patton state hospital for approximately 2-evaluation by a medical expert. while there is no indication in the record that either of these references corresponds to the 70-day commitment relied upon by the court, the record suggests recurring competency issues 9 moreover, appellant has not carried his burden on appeal to demonstrate error. he suggests contrary inferences that might be drawn, such as that the only time appellant spent at the state hospital occurred prior to his arrest, or that commitment might not have resulted in a finding of incompetence. but these suggestions are not supported by the record and do not affirmatively demonstrate error. we therefore conclude that the trial court did not err in its award of 324 days of conduct credits. disposition the judgment is modified to award appellant one additional day of custody credit, for a total of 719 days of credit. the judgment is affirmed in all other respects. the clerk is directed to prepare an amended abstract of judgment and forward it to the department of corrections and rehabilitation. not to be published in the official reports collins, j. we concur: willhite, acting p. j. manella, j.
