(people v. johnson (1980) 26 cal.3d 557, 578; see also jackson v. virginia (1979) 443 u.s. 307, 317320.) the standard of review is the same in cases in which the people rely mainly on circumstantial evidence. (people v. bean people v. cravens (2012) 53 cal.4th 500, 507.) we are compelled to affirm unless there is no hypothesis under which the evidence is sufficient.
