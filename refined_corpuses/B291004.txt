(kramer v. intuit inc. (2004) 121 cal.app.4th 574, 578.) ii. proposition 36 in 1994, california enacted the three strikes law. (people v. valencia (2017) 3 cal.5th 347, 359.) pursuant to that enactment, a defendant who committed a felony while having two prior serious or violent felony convictions had to be sentenced to onment . . . . ( 667, subd. (e)(2)(a), 1170.12, subd.

( 1170.126, subds. (e) & (f).) relevant to this appeal, one of the disqualifying exceptions to resentencing under proposition 36 is if the commission of the current offense, the defendant used a firearm, was armed with a firearm or deadly weapon, or intended to cause great bo( 667, subd. (e)(2)(c)(iii), 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(c)(iii)).) iii. no error numerous cases establish that proposition 36 disqualifies an inmate from being sentenced as a second-strike offender if his or her third felony conviction is for being a felon in possession of a firearm, and if the evidence shows the firearm was available for use either offensively or defensively.
