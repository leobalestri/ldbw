 filed 8/28/13 p. v. burgos ca2/5 not to be published in the official reports california rules of court, rule 8.1115(a), prohibits courts and parties from citing or relying on opinions not certified for publication or ordered published, except as specified by rule 8.1115(b). this opinion has not been certified for publication or ordered published for purposes of rule 8.1115. in the court of appeal of the state of california second appellate district division five the people, plaintiff and respondent, v. johnny burgos, defendant and appellant. b238795 (los angeles county super. ct. no. la067011) appeal from a judgment of the superior court of los angeles county, joseph a. brandolino, judge. affirmed in part, modified in part, and remanded with directions. marcia c. levine, under appointment by the court of appeal, for defendant and appellant. kamala d. harris, attorney general, dane r. gillette, chief assistant attorney general, lance e. winters, assistant attorney general, lawrence m. daniels, eric e. reynolds and allison h. chung, deputy attorneys general, for plaintiff and respondent. 2i. introduction a jury convicted defendant, johnny burgos, as charged in count 2 of lewd conduct upon a child under 14 years of age. (pen. code,1  288, subd. (a).) and, as to count 3, defendant was convicted of child molestation with a previous conviction. ( 647.6, subds. (a)(1) & (c)(2).) the jury further found true prior conviction and prison term allegations under sections 667, subdivisions (a)(1), (b) through (i), 1170.12 and 667.5, subdivision (b) respectively. defendant was sentenced to 35 years to life in state prison. we modify the judgment and remand with directions. ii. the evidence a. prior sex crimes evidence 1. a.r. defendant married s.b. on september 4, 1989. they subsequently had three sons. also in 1989, defendant victimized seven-year-old a.r. the mother of a.r. was s.b.s friend. that is, defendant, s.b.s spouse, molested a.r., the daughter of his wifes friend. defendant put his hands inside a.r.s nightgown and put his finger inside her vagina. a.r. freaked out in her words. defendant apologized and offered to let a.r. hit him. on october 16, 1989, defendant pled guilty to a violation of section 288, subdivision (a). on january 17, 1990, he was placed on five years probation on the condition, among others, that he serve 360 days in the county jail. despite therapy, a.r. had trouble sleeping, wet her bed until she was about 10, and could not be in the same 1 all further statutory references are to the penal code except where otherwise noted. 3room with men at school. a.r. testified, if . . . a man came near me, i would freak out and start screaming. 2. s.b.s niecesa.d. and ar.d. in 1994, defendant lived next door to s.b.s brother. s.b.s brothers family included two daughters, a.d. and ar.d. during that year, defendant molested a.d. and ar.d., both of whom were s.b.s nieces. a.d. was five or six years old when defendant sexually abused her. in 1994, a.d. often spent time with her cousins, including spending the night at their house. defendant would: wake a.d. up in the middle of the night; pull her pants and underwear down; pull his own pants down; and put his penis in her vagina. this happened five or six times. a.d. also saw defendant molesting ar.d. ar.d. was in the shower naked. defendant was in the shower with her. a.d. saw ar.d.s legs spread apart. also, a.d. saw ar.d. moving back and forth while in the shower with defendant. a.d. thought she would get in trouble if she told anyone. so she stayed silent. but when a.d. was eight or nine years old, a family member asked whether there was anything going on. a.d. broke down and said yes. on cross-examination, a.d. said that after she was molested, she had nightmares, did not sleep well, and went to therapy. ar.d. was three and four years of age when defendant molested her. defendant touched her private parts with his hands and his penis. he did it a lot of times. he made her touch his hard penis with her hands. defendant touched ar.d. when she was sleeping. also sleeping in the room were ar.d.s sister and cousins. he did not put his penis inside her; he rubbed it against her vagina. he did that more than 10 times. he molested her once in the bathroom during a birthday party. ar.d. knew defendant was molesting a.d. ar.d. testified, i was scared to look. after the molestation was reported, ar.d. attended therapy. defendant was convicted on november 18, 1998, of two counts of lewd act upon a child in violation of section 288, subdivision (a). on december 2, 1998, he was 4sentenced to 15 years in state prison. defendant was released from prison on march 7, 2006. he committed the present offenses shortly after his release. b. the present crimes 1. the prosecution case a. the victim, k.h. the victim, k.h., met defendant in 2006, when she was seven years old. k.h. is the cousin of a.d. and ar.d. defendant is the biological father of k.h.s three older brothers. there was no evidence k.h. knew defendant had molested a.d. and ar.d. prior to the 2006 assault. neither a.d. nor ar.d. had ever told k.h. about the molestations. nor did a.d. or ar.d. tell k.h.s brothers or their own siblings. nor did k.h.s parents ever tell her that defendant had been convicted of inappropriate sexual contact with her cousins. defendant and k.h. were alone in the kitchen together when he first molested her. defendant was sitting on a stool. he unzipped his pants. he pulled down k.h.s pants and her underwear. he told k.h. to sit on his lap. defendant did not move, but k.h. felt defendants penis pressing against her. the incident lasted about five seconds. defendant told k.h. to get off his lap. he said he was sorry. shortly thereafter, defendant and k.h. were lying on the bedroom floor or on a bed looking at a board game. defendant put his hand in k.h.s pants. he put his index finger in her vagina. he left his finger there for 10 minutes. k.h. was afraid defendant would hurt her if she told anyone. the next time k.h. saw defendant, she avoided him so he could not touch her. k.h. did not reveal the molestation until 2010, when she was 11. this was four years after the molestation ended. by then the memory of what happened was making her so sad that she need to tell someone. so k.h. wrote s.b. a letter. this was because k.h. did not know how to tell s.b. about being molested by defendant. k.h. left the note 5where s.b. would find it. k.h.s father found it instead. k.h. did not want to tell the police. but sometime later, her father became intoxicated and told police officers what had happened. k.h. was interviewed by a female police officer and, later, by detective mark leon. k.h. did not tell either one about what happened in the bedroom. she was more upset by the encounter in the kitchen. later, k.h. met with deputy district attorney pamela revel and detective leon. at that meeting, k.h. described both incidents to them. on cross-examination, k.h. said she did not know whether defendants finger was actually inside her vagina. she did not know how that would feel. she had never looked at or touched her vagina. k.h. was also questioned about the note discovered by her father. as previously explained, the note was intended for k.h.s mother. but the note was accidentally discovered by k.h.s father. in that note, k.h. wrote that defendant put his finger in her pee-pee or vagina. on redirect examination, ms. revel questioned k.h. further about the touching that occurred in the bedroom: ms. revel: your honor, im kind of indicating just two fingers . . . [] . . . kind of to represent like what your pee-pee is. okay? [] a yes. [] q okay. and when you say that he touched you, did he touch you on the outside of your pee-pee? [] a yeah. [] q okay. and then did he ever touch you on the inside of your pee-pee? [] a no. [] okay. . . . [a]re my fingers kind of demonstrating to you theyre kind of two sides? [] a yes. [] q and did he ever at all put his finger inside the two sides of you pee-pee? [] a no. [] q and so he touched the outside? [] a yes. b. detective leon a police report concerning the molestation of k.h. was prepared on september 27, 2010. detective leon interviewed k.h. at the police station on october 20, 2010. the interview was recorded. k.h. did not tell detective leon about what happened in the bedroom. the jury heard a recording of this first interview. detective leon was 6present when ms. revel interviewed k.h. in november 2010. the interview was not recorded. during this second interview, k.h. talked about defendants conduct in the bedroom. c. k.h.s mother, s.b. shortly after s.b. married defendant, she learned he had been convicted of child molestation. s.b. had babysat for the child. years later, defendant was arrested for molesting s.b.s two nieces, her brothers daughters. defendant was sentenced to prison. s.b. visited her husband in prison on most weekends. she brought their three boys with her until defendant was transferred. after the transfer, she went alone to visit defendant in prison. s.b. had been in a relationship with k.h.s father, s.h., for more than 13 years. the relationship began three months after defendant went to prison. s.b. did not worry about the safety of her own children with defendant. s.b. testified, i never thought about it. in june or july 2010, s.b. received the note k.h. had written. it said defendant had touched k.h. when she was younger. there were details in the note, but s.b. did not remember them. s.b. did not remember the details because, i rather would not have known. when asked what happened to the letter, s.b. testified, [k.h.] told me she ripped up the letter. s.b. and k.h. talked about defendants acts of molestation. when asked why the police were not thereafter notified, s.b. testified, [k.h.] asked me not to. the police learned about the molestation only after s.h. got drunk and fought with s.b. s.b. then called the police. when the police arrived, s.h. told them about k.h.s accusations. s.b. did not know whether she wanted defendant to be prosecuted because she was concerned about her sons. on cross-examination, s.b. testified that k.h. had seen defendant after the sexual abuse occurred. k.h. would hug defendant when she saw him. k.h. never voiced any displeasure or concern about defendant. k.h. never said she was afraid of him or that she did not want to see him. k.h. did not shrink from touching him. the last time k.h. had 7seen defendant was in las vegas, between 2008 and 2009. there had not been any change in k.h.s behavior after defendant came back into their lives. k.h. had gained weight due to inactivity. but she did not exhibit any bed-wetting, vaginal infections, sexual acting out, or withdrawal from the family. although k.h. knew defendant had been in prison, she never asked why he had been incarcerated. s.b. never put k.h. in therapy. this was because k.h. did not want to go to therapy. k.h. only mentioned one incident in her written note. she said defendant asked her to sit on his lap. k.h. told s.b. that defendant opened his pants. the note did not include anything about defendant touching her or taking her clothes off. d. s.h. s.h. had never seen defendant alone with k.h. the only time defendant was alone in a room with k.h., s.h. was nearby on the porch. k.h. would not talk to s.h. about the molestation. s.h. did not notice any behavioral changes in k.h. after defendants release from prison. k.h. never said she did not want to be around defendant. 2. the defense case defense counsel, christine field, produced a kitchen stool. k.h. testified it was similar in height to the one defendant sat on when he molested her in the kitchen. defendant sat on the stool in the jurys presence. ms. field subsequently argued to the jury that given defendants obesity, he would not have been able to sit on the stool, unzip his pants, and remove his penis. 8iii. discussion a. evidence code section 1108 defendant argues the trial court abused its discretion when it admitted prior victim testimony under evidence code section 1108 (section 1108). section 1108, subdivision (a) states, in a criminal action in which the defendant is accused of a sexual offense, evidence of the defendants commission of another sexual offense or offenses is not made inadmissible by section 1101, if the evidence is not inadmissible pursuant to section 352. our supreme court has held, available legislative history indicates section 1108 was intended in sex offense cases to relax the evidentiary restraints [evidence code] section 1101, subdivision (a), imposed, to assure that the trier of fact would be made aware of the defendants other sex offenses in evaluating the victims and the defendants credibility. (people v. falsetta (1999) 21 cal.4th 903, 911; see people v. villatoro (2012) 54 cal.4th 1152, 1174.) further our supreme court held, in exercising [the evidence code section 352] discretion as to a sexual offense, trial judges must consider such factors as its nature, relevance, and possible remoteness, the degree of certainty of its commission and the likelihood of confusing, misleading, or distracting the jurors from their main inquiry, its similarity to the charge offense, its likely prejudicial impact on the jurors, the burden on the defendant in defending against the uncharged offense, and the availability of less prejudicial alternatives to its outright admission, such as admitting some but not all of the defendants other sex offenses, or excluding irrelevant though inflammatory details surrounding the offense. (people v. falsetta, supra, 21 cal.4th at p. 917.) (people v loy (2011) 52 cal.4th 46, 61.) our review is for an abuse of the trial courts broad discretion. (ibid.; people v. thomas (2011) 52 cal.4th 336, 354-355.) there was no abuse of discretion in the present case. in response to the prosecutions section 1108 motion, the trial court carefully considered the relevant factors. the trial court reasonably concluded the sex offenses defendant committed against a.d., ar.d. and a.r. were similar to the crimes perpetrated on k.h. the pattern 9of defendants conduct in his interaction with each of the young girls was consistent. defendants victims all visited his home. all were known to him through his wife, s.b. all were very young at the time of the molestation. in two of the four cases, he apologized to his victim. defendant was in prison until 2006; he committed the present offenses shortly after his release. presentation of the other sex offenses evidence was relatively brief, hence there was no undue consumption of time. and there was no significant potential the jury would be confused. the jury was informed of defendants convictions for the prior offenses and of his incarceration history. the proper use of the evidence was addressed in jury instructions and the attorneys arguments. as noted, we have found no abuse of discretion in admitting the prior sex crimes evidence under section 1108. thus, we need not consider whether it was also admissible under evidence code section 1101. further, in light of our conclusion no abuse of discretion resulted under section 1108, defendants constitutional due process and fair trial rights were not violated by the admission of the prior sex offense evidence. (people v. falsetta, supra, 21 cal.4th at pp. 912-922; see people v. reliford (2003) 29 cal.4th 1007, 1009.) b. defendants new trial motion defendant argues he was entitled to a new trial. ar.d. testified defendant: put his penis in her vagina; touched her everywhere, including her vagina and buttocks; and rubbed his erect penis against her vagina. defendant asserts he was surprised by that testimony because no such conduct was reflected in the police reports or preliminary hearing testimony. defendant characterizes ar.d.s trial testimony as describing acts more inflammatory than the charged conduct. we review the denial of a new trial motion for an abuse of discretion. (people v. thompson (2010) 49 cal.4th 79, 140; people v. navarette (2003) 30 cal.4th 458, 526.) our supreme court has held, a trial courts ruling on a motion for new trial is so completely within that courts discretion that a reviewing court will not disturb the ruling absent a manifest and unmistakable abuse of 10that discretion. (people v. lewis (2001) 26 cal.4th 334, 364; people v. hayes (1999) 21 cal.4th 1211, 1260-1261.) (people v. thompson, supra, 49 cal.4th at p. 140.) here, the trial court reasonably concluded ar.d.s testimony did not describe conduct that was more egregious than that k.h. testified to, nor was it unduly prejudicial. there was no abuse of discretion. c. sentencing 1. sections 667.61 and 667.71: pleading and proof defendant was sentenced in part under sections 667.61, subdivisions (a) and (d)(1) and 667.71 due to his prior lewd act convictions. (see people v. mcqueen (2008) 160 cal.app.4th 27, 37-38; people v. lopez (2004) 119 cal.app.4th 355, 365-366.) the jury made no specific finding of prior qualifying convictions under section 667.61, subdivisions (a) and (d)(1) or section 667.71. no objection was interposed to the allegation in the second amended information. nor was an objection interposed to the verdict forms. thus, any constitutional or statutory contention as to the findings format is forfeited. (people v. bolin (1998) 18 cal.4th 297, 330; people v. toro (1989) 47 cal.3d 966, 976, disapproved on a different point in people v. guiuan (1998) 18 cal.4th 558, 568, fn. 3.) both statutes require that the qualifying facts be alleged in the information and admitted by the defendant or found true by the trier of fact. ( 667.61, subd. (o); see people v. anderson (2009) 47 cal.4th 92, 102-103; people v. torres (2011) 198 cal.app.4th 1131, 1147.) however, the second amended information alleges two prior qualifying convictions under section 667.61, subdivisions (a) and (d), and one prior qualifying conviction under section 667.71. the second amended information alleged: [w]ithin the meaning of penal code sections 667.61(a) and (d), as to defendant, johnny burgos, as to count(s) 2 that the following circumstances apply: lewd act upon child in violation of pc 288(a) on december 2, 1998  la029147 and lewd act upon a child in 11violation of pc 288(a) on january 17, 1990. the second amended information further alleged, pursuant to . . . section 667.71, as to count(s) 2[,] that the defendant was previously convicted of the crime of lewd act upon a child in violation of . . . section 288(a) on december 2, 1998 in the superior court of los angeles county. thus the second amended information put defendant on notice that he was being charged under those provisions. in addition, the jury found to be true the allegations that defendant sustained the prior qualifying convictions. the jury found as to counts 2 and 3, under sections 667, subdivisions (a)(1) and (b) through (i), 667.5, subdivision (b), and 1170.12, that defendant was convicted of violating section 288, subdivision (a) in case number 45679 on or about october 16, 1989, and in case number la029147 (two counts) on or about november 18, 1998. the pleading and proof requirements of sections 667.61 and 667.71 were thus satisfied. 2. sections 667, subdivision (e)(2)(a)(i) and 1170.12, subdivision (c)(2)(a)(i) defendant was sentenced to 25 years to life on count 2 under sections 667.61, subdivisions (a) and (d)(1), and 667.71. the trial court should have tripled the count 2 sentence pursuant to sections 667, subdivision (e)(2)(a)(i) and 1170.12, subdivision (c)(2)(a)(i) plus applicable enhancements. (people v. acosta (2002) 29 cal.4th 105, 118-128; people v. miranda (2011) 192 cal.app.4th 398, 416-417.) 3. count 3 prior serious felony conviction enhancement the attorney general argues the count 3 sentence must be enhanced pursuant to section 667, subdivision (a)(1). however, defendant was not convicted of a serious felony in count 3. rather, defendant was convicted of a violation of section 647.6, subdivisions (a)(1) and (c)(2) which is not a felony enumerated in section 1192.7, subdivision (c). thus, the 5-year section 667, subdivision (a)(1) enhancement may not be 12imposed on count 3 which is not a serious felony. ( 667, subd. (a)(1); 3 witkin & epstein, california criminal law (4th ed. 2012) punishment,  405, pp. 625-626.) the authority cited by the attorney general involves conduct described in prior convictions. here, the issue is whether the charge in the present case is a serious felony which it is not. 4. section 667.5, subdivision (b) a. jury prior serious felony conviction and prison term findings i. section 667, subdivisions (b) through (i) and 1170.12 prior serious convictions consistent with the second amended informations allegations, the jury found three prior serious felony conviction allegations to be true for purposes of sections 667, subdivision (b) through (i) and 1170.12. the prior conviction and prison term findings in the verdict referred to both counts 2 and 3. the jury found that defendant had been convicted in case no. 45679 in san joaquin county of violating section 288, subdivision (a) on october 16, 1989. also, the jury found that defendant had been convicted of violating section 288, subdivision (a) in los angeles county on november 18, 1998, in case no. la029147. finally, the jury found defendant had been convicted in a second count of violating section 288, subdivision (a) on november 18, 1998, in los angeles county in case no. la029147. ii. section 667, subdivision (a)(1) prior serious conviction findings the jury found defendant had sustained two section 667, subdivision (a)(1) prior serious felony convictions. these two prior serious felony convictions were sustained in case nos. 45679 on october 16, 1989, and la029147 on november 18, 1998, in san joaquin and los angeles counties respectively. only one section 667, subdivision (a)(1) prior serious felony conviction was alleged in case no. la029147. this was because the 13two los angeles county serious felony convictions were sustained in the same case and on the same date. thus, the los angeles county lewd conduct charges were not brought and tried separately within the meaning of section 667, subdivision (a)(1). (in re harris (1989) 49 cal.3d 131, 136-137; people v. deay (1987) 194 cal.app.3d 280, 286.) iii. section 667.5 prior prison term finding the jury found a single prior prison term allegation was true. the jury found that on november 18, 1998, defendant was sentenced to prison for a conviction of violating section 288, subdivision (a) in case no. la029147. the verdict form does not identify which of the two section 288, subdivision (a) lewd conduct on a child counts in case no. la029147 applied to the prior prison term finding. b. count 2 as noted, defendant was convicted in count 2 of lewd conduct on a child in violation of section 288, subdivision (a). lewd conduct on a child in violation of section 288, subdivision (a) is a violent felony. ( 667.5, subd. (c)(6); 3 witkin & epstein, california criminal law, supra, punishment,  401, p. 619.) therefore, given the prior violent felony prison term finding, defendant would typically be expected to serve three additional years. ( 667.5, subd. (a); 3 witkin, supra, punishment,  400, p. 617.) however, defendant contends the november 18, 1998 prison term resulted from his prior lewd conduct with a child conviction in case no. la029147. thus, defendant reasons that the prior prison term enhancement as to count 2 may not be imposed and must be stricken. (people v. jones (1993) 5 cal.4th 1142, 1150-1153; people v. perez (2011) 195 cal.app.4th 801, 805.) the attorney general argues defendant was convicted of two section 288, subdivision (a) counts in case no. la029147 and therefore may be sentenced on the prior prison term allegation. the attorney general reasons that only a single section 667, subdivision (a)(1) prior serious felony conviction enhancement was 14imposed as a result of case no. la029147. we agree with the attorney general. (people v. ruiz (1996) 44 cal.app.4th 1653, 1668-1669; people v. brandon (1995) 32 cal.app.4th 1033, 1055.) the trial court had jurisdiction only to impose or strike the section 667.5, subdivision (a) three-year enhancement pursuant to section 1385, subdivision (a). ( 12; people v. bradley (1998) 64 cal.app.4th 386, 390-392; people v. harvey (1991) 233 cal.app.3d 1206, 1231.) the imposition of a legally unauthorized sentence is an issue that can be raised for the first time on appeal by the attorney general. (people v. dotson (1997) 16 cal.4th 547, 554, fn. 6; people v. scott (1994) 9 cal.4th 331, 354.) as a result, upon remittitur issuance, the trial court is to either strike or impose the section 667.5 subdivision (a) three-year enhancement as to count 2. if the trial court decides to strike the count 2 section 667.5, subdivision (a) three-year enhancement, it must comply with section 1385, subdivision (a). if the trial court decides to strike the count 2 prior prison term three-year enhancement it must state its reasons for the exercise of its discretion in the minutes. (people v. superior court (romero) (1996) 13 cal.4th 497, 531; people v. orin (1975) 13 cal.3d 937, 944.) c. count 3 as to count 3, defendant is subject to a 25-year-to-life indeterminate term pursuant to sections 667, subdivision (e)(2)(ii) and 1170.12, subdivision (c)(2)(ii). because counts 2 and 3 are both indeterminate sentences, the prior prison term enhancement must be imposed on both counts, absent an order striking the additional term. (people v. williams (2004) 34 cal.4th 397, 401-405; people v. garcia (2008) 167 cal.app.4th 1550, 1559.) because count 3 is not a violent felony, only a one-year term may be imposed. ( 667.5, subd. (b); 3 witkin, supra, punishment,  400, p. 618.) upon remittitur issuance, the trial court is to exercise its discretion as described in the immediately preceding paragraph and either impose or strike the one-year enhancement. 155. section 654, subdivision (a) we asked the parties to brief the question whether the trial court improperly stayed the sentence on count 3. we apply section 654, subdivision (a) (section 654) to conceded facts as a matter of law. (people v. perez (1979) 23 cal.3d 545, 552, fn. 5; people v. baylor (1989) 207 cal.app.3d 232, 235.) we find section 654 did not preclude punishment for the sex offense charged in count 3. (see people v. scott, supra, 9 cal.4th at pp. 344, fn. 6, 346-347; people v. perez, supra, 23 cal.3d at p. 553; see also people v. jones (2012) 54 cal.4th 350, 374.) the court of appeal has explained: section 654 provides that [a]n act or omission that is punishable in different ways by different provisions of law shall be punished under the provision that provides for the longest potential term of imprisonment, but in no case shall the act or omission be punished under more than one provision. the section applies when there is a course of conduct which violates more than one statute but constitutes an indivisible transaction. (people v. saffle (1992) 4 cal.app.4th 434, 438.) generally, whether a course of conduct is a divisible transaction depends on the intent and objective of the actor: if all of the offenses were incident to one objective, the defendant may be punished for any one of such offenses but not for more than one. (neal v. state of california (1960) 55 cal.2d 11, 19[, disapproved on another point in people v. correa (2012) 54 cal.4th 331, 334, 338].) [] however, the rule is different in sex crime cases. even where the defendant has but one objectivesexual gratificationsection 654 will not apply unless the crimes were either incidental to or the means by which another crime was accomplished. (people v. perez[, supra,] 23 cal.3d [at p.] 553; e.g., people v. siko (1988) 45 cal.3d 820, 826 [separate punishment for lewd conduct impermissible where it was the very basis for his rape and sodomy convictions]; people v. greer (1947) 30 cal.2d 589, 604[, disapproved on another point in people v. fields (1996) 13 cal.4th 289, 308, fn. 6] [removal of victims underclothing was merely incidental to subsequent rape and did not warrant separate punishment]; people v. madera (1991) 231 cal.app.3d 845, 855 [section 654 would bar separate 16punishment for applying lubricant to the area to be copulated.].) (people v. alvarez (2009) 178 cal.app.4th 999, 1005-1006.) here, in counts 2 and 3, defendant committed two distinct sex crimes in two different locationsthe kitchen and the bedroom. neither sex offense was committed as a means of committing or facilitating the other. nor were the counts 2 and 3 sex offenses incidental to the commission of any other. therefore, section 654 did not preclude punishment for each of the sex offenses charged in counts 2 and 3. upon remittitur issuance, the trial court is to impose either a concurrent or consecutive sentence on count 3. ( 667, subd. (c)(6), 1170.12, subd. (a)(6); people v. lawrence (2000) 24 cal.4th 219, 233.) 6. section 290.3: sex offender fine the trial court only imposed a $500 sex offender fine plus penalties. defendant committed the present offenses on or between january 1, 2006, and december 31, 2007. the amount of the sex offender fine was increased effective september 2006 from: $200 for the first offense; $300 for subsequent offense to $300 for the first offense; and $500 for subsequent offenses. (stats. 2006, ch. 337,  18.) therefore, defendant was properly subject to a $500 fine. (see people v. voit (2011) 200 cal.app.4th 1353, 1372; people v. valenzuela (2009) 172 cal.app.4th 1246, 1248.) however, defendant was convicted of two counts both of which qualify for the fine. (see  290.3, subd. (c).) but, on a silent record, we presume the trial court found as to one of the counts defendant did not have an ability to pay the $500. (people v. sharret (2011) 191 cal.app.4th 859, 864 [health & saf. code,  11372.7, subd. (a) drug program fee]; people v. walz (2008) 160 cal.app.4th 1364, 1371 [sex offender fine].) in addition, because the trial court had the discretion to not impose the sex offender fine, the prosecutors failure to object forfeited any claim of error on appeal. (people v. tillman (2000) 22 cal.4th 300, 303; people v. sharret, supra, 191 cal.app.4th at p. 864.) thus, no action need be taken in connection with the sex offender fine. the abstract of 17judgment identifies the fine and the imposition of the penalties which includes the section 1465.7, subdivision (a) surcharge. 7. presentence conduct credit the trial court awarded defendant credit for 324 days in presentence custody, from march 7, 2011, to january 24, 2012. however, the trial court miscalculated defendants conduct credit as 65 days. defendant should have received only 48 days conduct credit. ( 667.5, subd. (c)(6); 2933.1.) the judgment must be modified to so provide. iv. disposition the judgment is modified to: impose an 85-year-to-life sentence on count 2; impose an unstayed concurrent or consecutive 25-year-to-life sentence on count 3; and award defendant conduct credit of 48 rather than 65 days. upon remittitur issuance, the trial court is to either impose or strike the prior prison term enhancements on counts 2 and 3. and the trial court is to impose a concurrent or consecutive term as to count 3 as explained in part iii (c)(5) of this opinion. the superior court clerk must then prepare an amended abstract of judgment and deliver a copy to the department of corrections and rehabilitation. not to be published in the official reports turner, p.j. we concur: kriegler, j. kumar, j.* * judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
