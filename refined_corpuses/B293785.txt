(a); count 1) and possession of a controlled substance, methamphetamine (health & saf. code,  11377, subd. (a); count 2). the court sentenced him under the three strikes law to two 25-years-to-life terms, to be served concurrently. in 2013, defendant filed a petition for recall of his sentence under the three strikes reform act of 2012 (proposition 36). (pen. code,  1170.126).1 after a hearing, the court found that mickey was ineligible for relief because he was armed with a deadly weaponthe car he was drivingduring the commission of count one. mickey appealed. we agree with mickey that the finding, and therefore reverse. factual and procedural summary a. 7 convictions on january 29, 1997, at about 11:30 a.m., officer michael ryan was driving a marked patrol car when he saw mickey, driving a chrysler lhs, enter the parking lot of a strip mall and drive north through the lot at a high speed. officer ryan followed mickey to the northeast corner of the lot. mickey made eye contact with officer ryan and, after two women got out of the car, accelerated and drove out of the parking lot and onto an adjacent street at a high speed. officer ryan followed. mickey turned onto a residential street, where the speed limit was 25 miles per hour, and drove at speeds of 45 to 50 miles per hour. officer ryan which mickey drove through a four-way stop intersection without 1 unspecified statutory references are to the penal code. 3 braking or slowing down. a school and a park are located about three blocks east of the intersection, which, according to officer amount of pedestrian flow in this pedestrians were present on either side of the street. officer ryan activated his siren. mickey, without slowing down, drove through another four-way stop intersection adjacent to the park and school. mickey then attempted unsuccessfully to make a u-turn by using his brakes to spin his car. after car came to rest, officer ryan stopped the patrol car in the intersection. the two cars then faced each other about six feet apart. mickey looked at the officer and accelerated toward the patrol car. he struck the front end of the patrol car, then traveled over a curb and collided with a brick wall. pedestrians were in this area at the time. mickey then drove away rapidly, with officer ryan in pursuit, and drove through another four-way stop intersection. he then made two left turns in quick succession, stopped his car, got out, and ran. he was apprehended a short time later in possession of four bags of methamphetamine. more methamphetamine was found in the chrysler. mickey was charged with evading a police officer with willful and wanton disregard for the safety of persons and property (veh. code,  2800.2, subd. (a); count 1), felony possession of a controlled substance (health & saf. code,  11377, subd. (a); count 2), and assault on a police officer by means likely to produce great bodily injury ( 245, subd. (c); count 3). a jury convicted him of the first two counts and acquitted him of count 3 and the lesser included offense of simple assault on a peace officer (former  241, 4 subd. (b).)2 in a bifurcated trial, the court found true allegations that mickey had committed 12 strike priors. the court sentenced him under the three strikes law to two 25-years-to-life terms, to be served concurrently. this court affirmed the judgment in an unpublished opinion (people v. mickey (dec. 29, 1999, b127039) [nonpub. opn.]). b. the petition for recall of sentence in march 2013, mickey filed a petition to recall his sentence pursuant to proposition 36. the court found that mickey had stated a prima facie showing of eligibility for resentencing and issued an order to the district attorney to show cause why the petition should not be granted.3 the people argued that mickey was ineligible for relief under proposition 36 for two reasons: (1) mickey intended to inflict great bodily injury on officer ryan when he drove toward and hit officer patrol car; and (2) mickey was armed with a deadly weaponhis vehiclewhen he drove the car at officer ryanvehicle. 2 at the time of the incident, penal code section 241, subdivision (bwhen an assault is committed against the person of a peace officer . . . engaged in the performance of his or her duties . . . and the person committing the offense knows or reasonably should know that the victim is a peace officer . . . engaged in the performance of his or her duties . . . , the assault is 1, p. 2626.) 3 in march 2017, mickey filed a petition for recall of sentence under the safe neighborhoods and schools act, or proposition 47 ( 1170.18), with respect to the conviction on count two for methamphetamine possession. counsel thereafter agreed to limit s proposition 36 petition to the conviction on count one for evading a police officer. 5 arguments are foreclosed by acquittal on count 3, assaulting a police officer with a deadly weapon. the court agreed with mickey that his acquittal on the charge of assaulting a police officer precluded the court from finding that he intended to inflict great bodily injury on the police officer or that he was armed with a dryan. although the [the] collision [with officer ryan] does not prevent [the] court from examining the rest of the pursuit to determine if [mickey] was armed with a deadly weapon at any point while committing the crime of evading a peace (italics omitted.) the court conducted that examination and concluded that mickey is ineligible for relief because he with a deadly weapon during the commission of count one the court explained: drove at 45 to 50 miles per hour through a residential area where pedestrians were present and the speed limit was 25 miles per hour. . . . he drove through three stop signs before abandoning his car to flee on foot. . . . accordingly, everdict [of acquittal on count three, mickey] willfully used his car in a manner likely to result in injury when he drove at twice the speed limit through a residential area, disregarding multiple stop signs. by willfully using his car in such a dangerous manner, he armed himself with a deadly weapon, regardless of whether he intended to use his car as a weapon. 6 discussion under proposition 36, an inmate serving a third-strike sentence for crimes that are not serious or violent felonies may be eligible for reduction in his or her sentence. ( 1170.126, subd. (e).) here, there is no dispute that the offenses for which mickey is incarceratedevading a police officer by driving with willful and wanton disregard for the safety of others and possessing a controlled substanceare nonserious and nonviolent felonies for purposes of the three strikes law. an inmate is statutorily ineligible for resentencing, however, if, among other disqualifying acts, he was armed with a . . . deadly ( 667, subd. (e)(2)(c)(iii); 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(c)(iii); 1170.126, subd. (e)(2); people v. johnson (2015) 61 cal.4th 674, 681.)4 one is if has the specified weapon available for use, either offensively or defensively.(people v. bland (1995) 10 cal.4th 991, 997.) to establish ineligibility for relief under proposition 36 on the ground that the defendant was armed with a deadly weapon, the people must prove that fact beyond a reasonable doubt. (people v. perez (2018) 4 cal.5th 1055, 1059 (perez); people v. frierson (2017) 4 (perez, supra, 4 cal.5th at p. 1066.) 4 if a petitioner is eligible for resentencing, the court must determines that resentencing the petitioner would pose an subd. (f).) because the court determined that mickey was not eligible for relief, it did not reach this consideration. 7 a deadly to be capable of producing and likely to produce, death or great bodily (people v. aguilar (1997) 16 cal.4th 1023, 10281029; accord, perez, supra, 4 cal.5th at p. 1068.) our supreme court has nthat serious injury could have resulted from the way the object was (in re b.m.

(see, e.g., people v. bipialaka (2019) 34 cal.app.5th 455, 458; people v. oehmigen (2014) 232 cal.app.4th 1, 56, 11; people v. golde (2008) 163 cal.app.4th 101, 116117; people v. finney (1980) 110 cal.app.3d 705, 716; people v. claborn (1964) 224 cal.app.2d 38, 42.) a vehicle has also been held to be a deadly weapon when it was driven in a reckless manner within a few feet of pedestrians with the intent to scare them. (people v. wright (2002) 100 cal.app.4th 703, 707, 725.) but evidence that a defendant drove through a residential neighborhood with willful or wanton disregard for the safety of persons or property while being pursued by police in two patrol vehicles was insufficient to support a finding that he used the car 8 as a deadly weapon. (people v. piper (2018) 25 cal.app.5th 1007, 1011, 1016, fn. 4.) here, the court, in examining the record of conviction, excluded from its consideration the evidence that mickey drove the chrysler lhs at and hit officer patrol car. the court disregarded that evidence, it explained, because the jury had acquitted mickey of the charge of assault upon a police officer with a deadly weapon, and it could (quoting people v. piper, supra, 25 cal.app.5th at p. 1015.) the court thus based its decision on the facts that mickey drove 45 to 50 miles per hour in a 25 mile-per-hour residential area when pedestrians were present, without stopping at stop signs. the attorney decision not to consider the evidence that mickey drove his car at othat fact in determining the sufficiency of the evidence. we will, therefore, limit our consideration of the evidence to that which the court considered. the evidence is insufficient to support the finding that mickey used the car as a deadly weapon. mickey drove 45 to 50 miles per hour in a residential 25 mile-per-hour zone and ran through stop signs at three 4-way stop intersections. although officer ryan testified that pedestrians were of the there is no evidence that any person was in or crossing a street in at or entering an intersection mickey drove through, or otherwise faced more than a mere possibility of being hit by the vehicle. the fact that mickey drove on streets near a park and school did not transform his car into a deadly weapon in the absence of evidence that anyone was at the school or park or, if anyone was present, that they were at risk of great bodily injury or . 9 in its ruling, the trial court stated before and after [the] collision [with o dangerous than the driving found to support assault with a deadly weapon . . . in [people v. aznavoleh (2012) 210 cal.app.4th 1181 (aznavoleh)]. aznavoleh, however, is distinguishable. in that case, the defendant was involved in a street race with another vehicle when he entered intersectionagainst a red light at a high rate of speed. (id. at pp. 11831184, 1189.) passengers in the down, and one screamed that the light was red. (id. at p. 1184.) although the defendant admitted he saw another vehicle enter the intersection and start to turn left in front of him, the court found that he (id. at p. 1189.) the defendant hit the other vehicle, causing injuries to one of his passengers and the driver of the other vehicle. here, by contrast, there is no evidence that anyone was enteringor even stopped at or approachingany of the four-way stop intersections that mickey ran. finding that mickey was armed with a deadly weapon, we reverse at basis. 10 disposition as to count one is reversed. the court shall, pursuant to section 1170.126, subdivision (f), determine whether resentencing would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. not to be published. rothschild, p. j. we concur: chaney, j. bendix, j.
