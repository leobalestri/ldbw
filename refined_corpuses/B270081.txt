filed 11/9/16 p. v. renteria ca2/8 not to be published in the official reports california rules of court, rule 8.1115(a), prohibits courts and parties from citing or relying on opinions not certified for publication or ordered published, except as specified by rule 8.1115(b). this opinion has not been certified for publication or ordered published for purposes of rule 8.1115. in the court of appeal of the state of california second appellate district division eight the people, plaintiff and respondent, v. ronald renteria, defendant and appellant. b270081 (los angeles county super. ct. no. ka500014) appeal from an order of the superior court of los angeles county, wade d. olson, judge. affirmed. david r. greifinger, under appointment by the court of appeal, for defendant and appellant. kamala d. harris, attorney general, gerald a. engler, chief assistant attorney general, lance e. winters, assistant attorney general, mary sanchez and paul s. thies, deputy attorneys general, for plaintiff and respondent. 2 this is another case involving resentencing under proposition 47, enacted by voters in the general election in november codified in [penal code] section 1170.18,[1] reduced the penalties for a number of offenses. among those crimes are certain second degree burglaries where the defendant enters a commercial establishment with the intent to steal. such offense is now characterized as shoplifting as defined in new section 4(people v. sherow (2015) 239 cal.app.4th 875, 879 (sherow).) completed his or her sentence for a conviction, whether by trial or plea, of a felony or felonies who would have been guilty of a misdemeanor under this act had this act been in effect at the time of the offense, may file an application before the trial court that entered the judgment of conviction in his or her case to have the felony conviction or convictions designated as misd in 1992, defendant ronald renteria was charged with one count of second degree burglary ( 459) and one count of hit and run causing injury (veh. code,  20001, subd. (a)) with two prison priors. he pled guilty in 1994 and the court sentenced him to two years in state prison and struck the priors. according to the probation report prepared for his sentencing, he and four others burglarized a furniture store during the 1992 los angeles riots. after they loaded furniture onto the back of defendsped away. he was involved in a traffic collision and fled the scene. ten people were seriously injured. the probation report indicated a spokesperson for the furniture store stated the 1 all undesignated statutory citations are to the penal code. 3 damages and loss of property amounted to approximately $4,877. on december 4, 2015, defendant filed a form petition requesting reclassification of his felony second degree burglary conviction as a misdemeanor pursuant to section 1170.18, subdivisions (a) and (f). defendant did not submit any evidence of value of the property involved. the trial court held a hearing on january 25, 2016, and denied the request. the court stated: 1 is a second degree burglary. my unwithout prejudicebut said nothing about whether the denial was with or without prejudice. the minute order noted, the people indicate that the loss in count 01 is over four thousand dollars and count 02 is not an eligible charge defendant without prejudice to him filing a new petition with supporting evidence of the value of the property taken. we will do so because that is what the trial court appears to have intended. prior to defendant filing his petition in this case in december 2015, at least two published opinions held the petitioner bears the initial burden to show eligibility for resentencing under proposition 47. (people v. rivas-colon (2015) 241 cal.app.4th 444, 449 [decided oct. 16, 2015]; sherow, supra, 239 cal.app.4th at p. 880 [decided aug. 11, 2015].) decisions published after his petition have followed suit. (people v. johnson (2016) 1 cal.app.5th 953, 964 (johnson) [decided 4 july 26, 2016]; people v. bush (2016) 245 cal.app.4th 992, 1007 [decided mar. 22, 2016]; people v. perkins (2016) 244 cal.app.4th 129, 136 (perkins) [decided jan. 25, 2016].) as the court in sherow nature of the items sherow, supra, at p. 880.) in johnson, the court clarified a defendant is not limited to the record of conviction in carrying the from any source resentencing. (johnson, supra, at p. 968.) the burden on him to submit evidence of value, and sherow suggested he could submit his own testimony, defendant presented no evidence of value. this was crucial because the probation report contained evidence that the value of the was over $4,000, well beyond the $950 cap for misdemeanor shoplifting under section 459.5. defendant asks for another opportunity to present evidence because the form he filed did not indicate he had to submit sherow, perkins, and johnson. those cases are to some extent distinguishable because the defendants were unaware of their initial burden or need to present evidence when they filed their original petitions. (see perkins, supra, 244 cal.app.4th at pp. 139-140 [noting prop. 47 is silent on burdens, the form at issue did not inform defendant he had to submit evidence, and 5 see also johnson, supra, 1 cal.app.5th at pp. 970-971 [relying on reasoning in perkins to deny petition without prejudice].)2 nonetheless, we will affirm without prejudice because the oral pronouncement indicated it was denying his petition without prejudice, signaling it would allow him to file a properly supported petition. respondent urges us to interpret the record as a denial with prejudice because the minute order of the hearing discrepancy in a minute order. (people v. farell (2002) 28 cal.4th 381, 384, fn. 2.) we also think it fair to give defendant another chance to file a properly supported petition, given the still-evolving nature of the burdens under proposition 47 at the time he filed his first petition. is affirmed without prejudice to defendant filing a properly supported petition. flier, j. we concur: rubin, acting p. j. grimes, j. 2 sherow did not state a specific reason for affirming denial the burden to the petitioner to show initial entitlement to relief, fairness dictated giving the petitioner in that case a chance to file a properly supported petition.
