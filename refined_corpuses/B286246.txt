(a)(1)). the trial court found that defendant had suffered five prior convictions within the meaning of the three strikes law ( 667, subds. (b)-(i); 1170.12, subds. (a)-(d)) and sentenced him to a term of 25 years to life in prison. in 2013, defendant filed a petition for recall and resentencing pursuant to proposition 36 ( 1170.126). the trial court denied the petition on the ground that defendant was ineligible because he was armed during the commission of the offense. defendant timely appealed. discussion overview of section 1170.126 in november 2012, voters in california approved proposition 36, which enacted section 1170.126. that statute established a procedure under which a defendant serving an 1 all further statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise specified. 3 indeterminate life sentence as a third strike offender for a non-serious or non-violent felony that was a strike under the pre-proposition 36 version of the three strikes law, could file a petition for recall of sentence and request resentencing as a second strike offender for that offense. (teal v. superior court (2014) 60 cal.4th 595, 596-597 (teal).) under section 1170.126, an inmate serving an indeterminate third-strike term for a crime that is not a serious or violent felony may petition for resentencing, unless his third-strike offense comes within one of the statutory exceptions to eligibility. ( 1170.126, subd. (e).) one such exception applies when . . . [the defendant] was armed with a firearm.(c)(2)(c)(iii), 667, subd. (e)(2)(c)(iii), 1170.126, subd.

(people v. martinez (2014) 226 cal.app.4th 1169, 1181.) section 1170.126 was enacted by the electorate when it approved proposition 36. (teal, supra, 60 cal.4th at pp. 596-597.) the same rules that apply in construing a statute enacted by the people v. park (2013) 56 cal.4th 782, 4 796 (park).) when we interpret a stascertain the intent of the enacting legislative body so that we may adopt the construction that best effectuates the purpose of people v. albillar (2010) 51 cal.4th 47, 54-55.) because section 1170.126 was enacted by the electorate, parkordinary and usual meaning and viewing them in their statutory context, because the statutory language is usually the most albillar, at p. 55.) if the language of the statute is ambiguous, we examine and arguments contained in the official ballot pamphlet. (people v. briceno language of the statute is not ambiguous, the plain meaning controls and resort to extrinsic sources to determine the albillar, at p. provisions must be construed to conform to that intent. park, at p. 796.) an inmate is ineligible for resentencing under section defendant used a firearm, was armed with a firearm or deadly weapon, or intended to cause great bodily injury to another tions 667, subdivision (e)(2)(c)(iii) and 1170.12, subdivision (c)(2)(c)(iii).

(see, e.g., people v. cruz (2017) 15 cal.app.5th 1105; osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th 1020; people v. white (2014) 223 cal.app.4th 512; people v. blakely (2014) 225 cal.app.4th 1042; people v. brimmer (2014) 230 cal.app.4th 782; people v. hicks (2014) 231 cal.app.4th 275.) defendant urges us to reject this uniform line of authority because courts in those cases a felony (when there must be a facilitative nexus between the commission a felony, when a temporal nexus is sufficient. he atutory construction, basic grammar, and legislative intent support his argument that the two terms can be used interchangeably, and that a facilitative nexus standard should apply when determining whether an inmate was rlying felony for purposes of resentencing under proposition 36. the distinction courts have drawn between being armed in which those terms are used. courts have distinguished between imposition of a sentence enhancement for anyone armed disqualification for sentencing relief under section 1170.126 if commitment felony. (osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at pp. 1030-1031.) facilitative nexus between the arming and the crime. (bland, supra, 10 cal.4th at p. 999.) no such facilitative nexus exists when the underlying crime is possession of a firearm by a felon, 7 (osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1032.) a defendant convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm accordingly does not risk imposition of additional punishment under section 12022. unlike sentence enhancement statutes such as section 12022, whiin the proposition 36 disqualifies an inmate from eligibility for lesser during the not a facilitative one. (osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1032.) as the court in osuna [citations], and since at issue is not the imposition of additional punishment but rather eligibility for reduced punishment, we conclude the literal language of the [statute] disqualifies an inmate from resentencing if he or she was armed with a firearm ibid.) support for this interpretation of section 1170.126 may be only narrowly drawn categories of third strike offenders who committed particular, specified offenses or types of offenses, but also broadly inclusive categories of offenders who, during commission of their crimes -- statutory elements -- used a firearm, were armed with a firearm or deadly weapon, or intended to cause great bodily injury to osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1036), and 8 related to proposition 36. these materials included statements that the initiative the third strike conviction was for certain nonserious, non-violent sex or drug offenses or involved firearm possession.(ibid.) the court in osuna initiative measure would shorten sentences for some third strikers, the legislative analyst explained there would be some requires that if the offender has committed certain new or prior offenses, including some drug-, sex-, and gun-related felonies, he or she would still be subject to a life sentence under the three ibid.) the court in osuna conducted an extensive review of ballot materials that distinguished between of simple drug possession) who posed little or no risk to the public convicted of two or more serious and/or violent felonies in the pid. at in osuna rejected the claim that conviction for possession of a purposes of ineligibility for resentencing under section 1170.126. (osuna, at p. 1038.) people v. estrada (2017) 3 cal.5th 661 (estrada) similarly negates the argument that there must be a facilitative nexus between being armed with a firearm and the underlying offense for a defendant to be ineligible for resentencing under proposition 36. the court in estrada n (c)(2)(c)(iii) provides only one express nexus requirement between [its] general 9 d]uring [citation.al overlap: something that occurs throughout the duration of an event or at some point in its course. [citation.] the term implies, at a minimum, a need for a temporal connection between the although the need to establish such a nexus imposes certain limits on the applicability of the firearm-related exception, [proposition 36] could certainly have imposed an even stricter requirement for triggering the exception. (see [bland, supra, ] 10 cal.4th [at p.] 1002 . . . because [proposition 36] does not do so, we may infer some kind of temporal limitation on the retroactive application of section 1170.12, estrada, at p. 670, fn. omitted.) defendant argues that estrada did not address the issue of whether arming must be tethered to the underlying offense, and the use, arming and intent described in section 1170.12, subdivision (c)(2)(c)(iii) must have a more-than-coincidental estrada, supra, 3 cal.5th at p. 670, fn. 4.) while it is true that estrada did not decide the preciseligibility for resentencing under proposition 36 should be narrowly cserving sentences for the mere commission of a gun possession 10 the supreme court in estrada noted, as defendant does in this appeal, that proposition 36 specifies three categories of offenses that are ineligible for resentencing, and that the third from the other two. the first two categories of ineligible offenses (1170.12, subds. (c)(2)(c)(i) and (c)(2)(c)(ii)), the court explained, but instead more general terms describing how criminal offenses estrada, supra, 3 cal.5th at pp. 669-670.) the supreme court rejected any facilitative nexus requirement ivision inclusive categories of offenders who, during commission of their crimes -- -- used a firearm, were armed with a firearm or deadly weapon, estrada, at p. 670.) nexus or tethering test, a felon in possession of a firearm would always be found to be armed simply because he is possession of a firearm and that all weapons offenses would therefore be ineligible for resentencing under proposition 36. the premise underlying this argument -- section 1170.12(c)(2)(c)(iii) is synonymous with simple possession of a firearm under former section 12021 -- is untrue. a defendant may be convicted of violating former section 12021 based on mere . . . not in his actual possession, [but] nonetheless under his dominion and 11 [citation.]osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1029, quoting people v. pena (1999) 74 cal.app.4th 1078, 1083-example, suppose a pasearched and a firearm is found next to his bed. the parolee is in possession of the firearm, because it is under his dominion and control. if he is not home at the time, however, he is not armed with the firearm, because it is not readily available to him for (blakely, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1052.) such a defendant would be eligible for proposition 36 relief. (ibid.) in such a case, the facilitative nexus test would be uof sections 1170.12, subdivision (c)(2)(c)(iii), and 667, subdivision (e)(2)(c)(iii), and thus eligible for relief under section 1170.126, subdivision (e)(2). a firearm cannot be available for use when it contrast, defendant had actual possession of the firearm and it was accordingly available for his use. the trial court did not err in ruling that defendant was ommission of the crime of felon in possession of a firearm, and was thus ineligible for resentencing under proposition 36. disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. ____________________________, j. chavez we concur: __________________________, p. j. lui __________________________, j. hoffstadt
