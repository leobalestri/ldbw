(a)(2)), and one count of attempted second degree robbery ( 211, 664). after a court trial, the following allegations as to all counts were found to be true: (1) a principal was armed with a firearm ( 12022, subd. (a)(1)); (2) defendant personally used a firearm ( 12022.53, subd. (b)); (3) defendant had suffered three prior strike convictions ( 667, subds. (b)-(i), 1170.12); (4) defendant had suffered three prior convictions of a serious felony ( 667, subd. (a)(1)); and (5) defendant had served three prior prison terms ( 667.5, subd. (b)). the court sentenced defendant to 236 years to life plus 38 years in state prison. on appeal, defendant contends the trial court abused its discretion in denying his marsden2 and romero3 motions, and in failing to stay the sentence on count 11 (attempted robbery). we find no ground for reversal and affirm the judgment. facts prosecution homan saw two men otwo men entered a branch of the washington mutual bank. deputy homan looked inside 1 all further statutory references are to the penal code. 2 people v. marsden (1970) 2 cal.3d 118. 3 people v. superior court (romero) (1996) 13 cal.4th 497. 3 the bank and observed what appeared to be a robbery of the bank. she went inside a store next to the bank and reported the robbery to the police. at trial, she identified defendant as the man in the security outfit. several customers and employees in the bank at the time of the robbery testified at trial. the men took money belonging to the bank from bank employees and also took money from customers. teller diane moreno (moreno) saifrom bank customer thomas bartlette and then ordered him to lie on the floor. the same money, which had been obtained from cashing his payroll check. the person in the white jumpsuit obtained $985 in cash from moreno. manager sonia mubaraka said the two men screamed and threatened people with a gun. a few minutes after watching the two men enter the bank, deputy homan observed the two exit the bank and leave in a green four-door bmw with a handicapped license plate. deputy jeffrey jackson, who responded to the call about a robbery in progress, spotted the green bmw and engaged in a pursuit, during which the bmw traveled at over 100 miles per hour. a money bag was thrown onto the street at some point. after losing sight of the bmw, deputy jackson found it parked by the havenhurst avenue off-ramp. maria newton (newton) was alone in the vehicle and stated that the canine units found defendant and bobby black (black) hiding in a residential garage near the vehicle. numerous items were recovered on the freeway along the path of the pursuit, including a brown leather tool belt and a blue windbreaker, a white gown, in an alleyway near where defendant was found. a search of the bmw revealed an envelope with written directions to the bank that was robbed. insurance papers for the bmw in the names of black and newton4 were also found inside the car. 4 codefendants black and newton are not part of the instant appeal. 4 have possibly been the source of the dna found on the hat band of the black hat with the defense newton testified that she drove defendant and black to the bank and, after they entered the car, she drove fast and recklessly, but she insisted she did not know what happened inside the bank. newton confirmed that defendant was wearing a blue windbreaker and black, her boyfriend, was wearing a white jumpsuit. before the robbery, newton got out of the car at the mall to buy coffee, and black and defendant were gone when she came back. the parking lot. after driving fast on the freeway, she exited at a ramp and stopped. defendant and black left the car. she falsely told the police that they forced her to drive discussion substitute appointed attorney is not providing adequate representation [citation] or that defendant and counsel have become embroiled in such an irreconcilable conflict that ineffective representation is likely tpeople v. welch (1999) 20 cal.4th 701, 728, citing people v. memro (1995) 11 cal.4th 786, 857.) people v. marsden, supra, 2 cal.3d at p. 124 gives a defendant who seeks to substitute counsel the right to a hearing to explain the reasons for the request. once the hearing is held, the decision whether or not to allow the defendant to substitute counsel rests within the sound discretion of the trial court 5 people v. burton (1989) 48 cal.3d 843, 855; accord, memro, supra, at p. 857.) defense of his own choosing, but merely the right to an adequate and competent defense. [citation.] tactical disagreements between the defendant and his attorney do not by represented bpeople v. welch, supra, 20 cal.4th at pp. 728-729.) neither does a lack of rapport or a lack of trust between defendant and counsel require that a motion to substitute counsel be granted. (people v. memro, supra, 11 people v. clark (1992) 3 cal.4th 41, 100.) in the instant case, on december 13, 2007, thomas burns of the alternate public ney burns as his counsel. the following day, defendant relinquished his pro. per. status and the court appointed lawrence sperber as his counsel. trial began with jury selection on november 13, 2010. on december 10, -in-chief, defendant requested a marsden hearing. during the marsden hearing, defendant indicated that he wanted his defense to be based on the fact that he was probably suffering from the effects of a blackout at the time of the bank robbery and lacked the intent to commit the crimes. defendant complained that counsel did not want to proceed with such a defense and refused to subpoena records to support such a defense. defendant indicated this conflict was the same conflict he had with his prior counsel and this had led him to seek pro. per. status. 6 asked whether defendant had any defenses and support evidence and defendant answered marsden motion. defendant claims that the trial court violated his sixth amendment right to counsel by refusing to grant his marsden motion, because the conflict with counsel resulted in a failure to present the only possible defense theory. we disagree. the trial court permitted defendant to explain the reason that he felt that counsel was providing inadequate representation. (people v. marsden, supra, 2 cal.3d at p. 124.) a defendant is entitled to new appointed counsel if the existing counsel is not providing adequate representation or if there is an irreconcilable conflict in the relationship such that ineffective representation is likely to result. (people v. fierro (1991) 1 cal.4th 173, 204.) the trial court has broad discretion in determining whether defendant has made an adequate showing to justify the granting of the marsden motion. there is no showing in marsden motion was an abuse of discretion. [simply a] rigpeople v. welch, supra, 20 cal.4th at p. people v. hamilton (1989) 48 cal.3d 1142, 1162.) simply the evidence presented. the robbery was clearly planned before it was committed. there were directions to the bank in the bmw. defendant and black were wearing costumes suspicious enough to draw the attention of a sheriff deputy. evidence of the crime was thrown from the vehicle during the escape. defendant ran from the vehicle after the pursuit and hid until he was located by canine units. trial counsel had a right to refuse to 7 adopt any defense which he believed to be untenable. (see, e.g., (2010) 48 cal.4th 257, 286.) in light of the evidence presented, defendant has not shown how he was prejudiced e thus has failed to demonstrate an abuse of discretion in the denial of his marsden motion. (people v. henning (2009) 178 cal.app.4th 388, 405.) romero motion sentencing court retains the discretion under section 1385, subdivision (a), to strike the prior convictions in the interests of justice. (people v. superior court (romero), supra, 13 cal.4th at pp. 505, 529-530.) because a decision to strike or not to strike prior convictions lies within the discretion of the trial court, we cannot reverse that decision except for an abuse of discretion. (people v. carmony (2004) 33 cal.4th 367, 376.) the abuse of discretion standard is a deferential one. (people v. williams (1998) 17 ibid.) ken by a reasonable judge (people v. superior court (romero), supra, 13 cal.4th at pp. 530-531) people v. jordan (1986) 42 cal.3d 308, 316; people v. franco (1994) 24 cal.app.4th 1528, 1542-1543.) that the sentencing decision was irrational or arbitrary. [citation.] in the absence of such a showing, the trial court is presumed to have acted to achieve legitimate sentencing objectives, and its discretionary determination to impose a particular sentence will not be be reversed 8 people v. superior court (alvarez) (1997) 14 cal.4th 968, 977-978; accord, people v. carmony, supra, 33 cal.4th at pp. 376-377.) in deciding whether to dismiss prior convictions under section 1385, subdivision his current offense and other individualized considerations (people v. superior court (romero), supra, 13 cal.4th at p. 531; people v. dent (1995) 38 cal.app.4th 1726, 1731), including all of the relevant factors, both aggravating and mitigating (people v. tatlis (1991) 230 cal.app.3d 1266, 1274; see people v. jordan, supra, 42 cal.3d at p. e be treated as thought he had not previously been convicted of one or more serious and/or people v. williams, supra, 17 cal.4th at p. 161; accord, people v. carmony, supra, 33 cal.4th at p 377.) defendant contends that the trial court abused its discretion in denying his romero motion. he argues that the court should have given greater weight to the length of his sentence, his age (65 at the time of sentencing), and his fragile medical condition (brain lesions, seizures, blackouts and strokes). advanced age is not necessarily a mitigating factor. (see people v. strong alone, cannot take a defendant outside the spirit of the law; otherwise, the very factor that takes a defendant within the spirit of the lawa lengthy criminal career with at least one serious or violent felonywould have the inevitable consequenceagethat would purportedly t here, the court could not overlook the failure of any prior rehabilitative efforts by defendant. he continued to commit criminal offenses over the course of his life. the trial court, in considering the romero motion, clearly exercised its discretion. in part, the trial court stated: people [v.] williams, [supra], 17 cal.4th 148, it held that the court must 9 serious or violent felony convicharacter, and prospects that defendant may be deemed outside the spirit of the scheme of the three strikes law in whole or in part, and hence should be treated as though he had not previously been convicted of one or more serious or violent felony convictions. i did take note from the pre-plea report that the defendant has an adult history, as far as convictions are concerned, back to 1966. e received substantially lengthy terms. for example, in 1980 a five-year plus 25-year consecutive sentence; in 1988, a five-year plus 25-year consecutive sentence that occurred. and in 1994, a 30-year sentence in which he was on probation at the time of the commission of this offense. based upon the law and the facts i have before me, i cannot say the defendant is outside the spirit of the scheme of the three strikes law at all, and the motion to strike or more of ands now convicted of yet another bank robbery, a planned armed robbery of a bank where both customers and bank employees were robbed at gunpoint. during the sentencing hearing, defendant indicated that his record of prior convictions was not correct. he stated that in 1980 he was convicted of a charge and was incarcerated from 1980 until 2004. he stated that he was not convicted or arrested in 1988 or 1994. even assuming defendant was correct, his record certainly justified the grant his romero motion. the trial court, during a court trial on the prior violations, found true that defendant had suffered three strike convictions in 1966, 1973 and 1980. if, in fact, defendant was not released from prison until 2004 and did not commit any offenses in 1988 or 1994, he was not released from custody for a significant period of time from 2004 until 2007 when he committed the current offenses. compelling reason for the trial court to deny his romero motion. (see people v. strong, supracourts have reversed the dismissal of, or affirmed the refusal to dismiss, a strike of those defendpeople v. carmony, 10 suprabalanced the relevant facts and reached an impartial decision in conformity with the spirit o his persistent unwillingness or inability to comply with the law. indeed, despite his argument of his ill people v. stone (1999) 75 cal.app.4th 707, 717.) the fact that the sentence imposed by the trial court will result in defendant spending the rest of his life in prison is a reason defendant should have defendant did not fall outside the purview of the three strikes lawand to the contrary, exemplified the need for the lawwas well within its discretion. failure of trial court to stay count 11 (attempted robbery) defendant contends the trial court violated section 654,5 which prohibits punishment for multiple offenses arising from the same act or from a series of acts constituting an indivisible course of conduct (people v. latimer (1993) 5 cal.4th 1203, 1207-1208; people v. harrison (1989) 48 cal.3d 321, 335), by imposing separate sentences for the robbery (count 3) and attempted robbery (count 11) as to a single victim, moreno. according to defendant, since the two acts were made pursuant to a single objective to rob money from the same victim, the court should have stayed count 11 pursuant to section 654. 5 different ways by different provisions of law shall be punished under the provision that provides for the longest potential term of imprisonment, but in no case shall the act or omission be punished under more than one provision. an acquittal or conviction and sentence under any one bars a prosecution for the s 11 gives rise to more than one act within the meaning of section 654 depends on the intent and objective of the actor. if all of the offenses were incident to one objective, the (people v. britt (2004) 32 cal.4th 944, 951-nd, defendant incidental to each other, he may be punished for each statutory violation committed in or were parts people v. harrison, supra, 48 cal.3d at p. 335; accord, people v. vu objective were single in re jose p. (2003) 106 cal.app.4th 458, 469.) whether section 654 applies in a given case is a question of fact for the trial court, which is vested with broad latitude in making its determination. (people v. hutchins (2001) 90 cal.app.4th 1308, 1312; people v. herrera (1999) 70 cal.app.4th 1456, 1466, disapproved on another ground in people v. mesa (june 4, 2012, s185688) ___ cal.4th ___ [2012 cal. lexis 5204].) its findings will not be reversed on appeal if there is any substantial evidence to support them. (hutchins, at p. 1312; herrera, at p. 1466; people v. nichols (1994) 29 cal.app.4tdetermination in the light most favorable to the [defendant] and presume the existence of people v. jones (2002) 103 cal.app.4th 1139, 1143; see people v. cleveland (2001) 87 cal.app.4th 263, most favorable to the judgment].) in the instant case, after moreno was robbed of $985 cash she had obtained from 12 was accompanied by a verbal threat. moreno testified that the acts occurred within a in people v. nubla (1999) 74 cal.app.4th 719, on which the people rely, the defendant committed several acts of violence against his wife, and the appellate court held it was not error to impose multiple sentences for assault and corporal injury on a id. at p. 730.) the court stated that just punishable criminal act, notwithstanding that all the offenses arguably were done to ibidas a means of committing any other, none facilitated commission of any other, and none id. trial court was entitled to conclude that each act was separate for purposes of . . . section ibid.) similarly here, the first robbery was completed and other robberies committed before defendant returned to attempt to rob moreno a second time. the two robberies were not committed to facilitate the other; neither was one incidental to the other. by contrast, in people v. marquez (2000) 78 cal.app.4th 1302, on which -conceived effort, [the] defendant walked up to the counter at [a] [r]estaurant, threatened [the] waitress . . . with a handgun, thereby money from the cash drawer. this was an indivisible transaction involving a single victim who was forced to relinquish possession of two separately owned amounts of idid. at p. 1308, italics omitted.) 13 the facts in the instant case are distinguishable from marquez. although the offenses occurred in a brief period of time, defendant had committed the first robbery of moreno, and then the attention was focused on other cash dispensers. after that, defendant returned to moreno and attempted to rob her again. the acts were not -marquez. (people v. marquez, supra, 78 cal.app.4th at p. 1307.) finally, the case of people v trotter (1992) 7 cal.app.4th 363 supports separate punishment. in trotter, the defendant was driving a vehicle with a police officer in pursuit. three times during the course of the pursuit, the defendant fired at the officer. (id. at p. 366.) the defendant was convicted on three counts of assault with a firearm on a peace officer. the trial court sentenced him consecutively on all three counts. he contended that under section 654 he could be sentenced on only one of the counts. (id. at pp. 365, 366.) the court noted that each assault was a separate volitional act. each was separated from the others by a period of time in which reflection and consideration was possible. each posed a separate and distinct risk to the pursuing police officer. each people v. trotter, supra, 7 cal.app.4th at p. 368.) the court concluded that the defendant should not be rewarded with only one portunity (ibid., quoting from people v. harrison, supra, 48 cal.3d at p. 338.) it therefore upheld separate and consecutive punishment on each of the three assault counts. (trotter, supra, at p. 368.) the same is true here. defendant could have stopped his crimes after each refusal to apply section 654 to count 11 is supported by substantial evidence. 14 disposition the judgment is affirmed. jackson, j. we concur: woods, acting p. j. zelon, j.
