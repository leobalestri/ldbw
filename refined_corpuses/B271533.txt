(people v. glaser (1995) 11 cal.4th 354, 362; people v. loewen (1983) 35 cal.3d 117, 123.) the search of a person who is on probation and subject to search conditions is reasonable under the fourth amendment as long as the law enforcement officials conducting the search know the person is on probation and as long as the search is not harassing and is conducted in an reasonable manner.
