filed 6/9/16 p. v. johnson ca2/3 not to be published in the official reports california rules of court, rule 8.1115(a), prohibits courts and parties from citing or relying on opinions not certified for publication or ordered published, except as specified by rule 8.1115(b). this opinion has not been certified for publication or ordered published for purposes of rule 8.1115. in the court of appeal of the state of california second appellate district division three the people, plaintiff and respondent, v. curtis johnson, defendant and appellant. b264651 (los angeles county super. ct. no. ba384415) appeal from a judgment of the superior court of los angeles county, craig richman, judge. affirmed. kelly c. martin, under appointment by the court of appeal, for defendant and appellant. no appearance for plaintiff and respondent. _____________________ 2 defendant and appellant curtis johnson appeals the denial of post-trial motions following his conviction of assault with a firearm, felon in possession of a firearm, and possession of an illegal shotgun. after this court affirmed his convictions and sentence on appeal, johnson filed pro se new trial motions in the trial court which were denied as untimely and on the merits. we now affirm those rulings. background johnson represented himself at the evidentiary portion of his trial. the evidence showed1 that he and his occasional roommate argued, after which johnson shot at her with a sawed-off shotgun, put the barrel of the shotgun into her mouth and threatened to kill her, and then threatened a second person before fleeing from the scene. johnson testified in his own defense, denying that he had anything to do with the shooting and asserting that he did not even own a shotgun. the jury convicted johnson of assault with a firearm with a finding that he personally used a firearm (pen. code,  245, subd. (a)(2), 12022.5, subd. (a); count 1)2, being a felon in possession of a firearm (former  12021, subd. (a)(1), now  29800, subd. (a)(1); count 2) and possessing a short-barreled shotgun (former  12020, subd. (a)(1), now  33210; count 3). after the jury found him guilty, johnson relinquished his pro se status and counsel was appointed for purposes of sentencing. following a court trial, the trial judge found true the allegations that johnson had been convicted of two prior serious felonies ( 667, subd. (a)), which were also strikes pursuant to the hree strikes law ( 667, subds. (b)-(e), 1170.12, subds. (a)-(d)), and that he had served seven prior prison terms for felony convictions ( 667.5, subd. (b)). at sentencing, pursuant to section 1385, subdivision (a), the trial court dismissed one of the three strikes prior conviction findings, as well as the seven prior prison term enhancement findings. (see people v. superior court (romero ) (1996) 13 cal.4th 497.) 1 prior appeal, people v. johnson (sept. 24, 2013, b240999) [nonpub. opn.]). 2 all further statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise specified. 3 the trial court then imposed a determinate second-strike term of 28 years in state prison, calculated as follows. on count 1, assault, the court sentenced johnson to eight years (the upper term of four years, doubled under the three strikes law), enhanced by two consecutive terms of 10 years for the personal use of a firearm and for the two prior serious felony convictions. on count 2, being a felon in possession of a firearm, the trial court imposed a concurrent term of six years (the upper term of three years, doubled under the three strikes law). on count 3, the trial court stayed sentencing for the offense of possessing a short-barreled shotgun pursuant to section 654, the prohibition on multiple punishment. this court, in people v. johnson, supra, b240999, then convictions and sentence on appeal, during which he was represented by appointed appellate counsel. subsequently, on january 7, 2014, johnson filed a pro se new trial motion which raised issues concerning both the conduct of the evidentiary portion of his trial as well as decisions made at his sentencing. on april 29, 2015, the trial court ruled untimely, but the court also denied the motion on the merits. on may 4, 2015, johnson filed a pro se motion for sentence modification under section 1181. on june 26, 2015, the trial court denied this second motion, again finding it untimely while also denying it on the merits. meanwhile, on may 26, 2015, johnson filed a pro se notice of appeal purportedly 18, 2016, we on april 29, 2015, and from the denial of a motion for resentencing on june we appointed counsel to represent johnson on this appeal. after reviewing the record, appellate counsel filed an opening brief requesting this court to independently review the record pursuant to people v. wende (1979) 25 cal.3d 436, 441. we directed counsel to send the record on appeal and a copy of the opening brief to johnson, and notified defendant he had 30 days within which to personally submit any contentions or issues that he wished us to consider. no supplemental brief was filed. 4 discussion may move for a new trial on various statutory grounds including that the verdict is contrary to the law or evidence. ( 1181.) a trial court may grant a motion for new trial only if the defendant demonstrates reversible error. [citation.] with regard to claims of ial, the trial court must weigh the evidence independently. [citation.] it is, however, guided by a presumption in favor of the correctness of the verdict and proceedings supporting it. . . but instead . . . should consider the proper weight to be accorded to the evidence and then decide whether or not, ing on a motion for new trial is reviewed for (people v. guerra (2006) 37 cal.4th 1067, 1159-1160, disapproved on other grounds in people v. rundle (2008) 43 cal.4th 76, 151.) post-judgment motions were indeed untimely. (see  1182 ;  1181 [enumerating statutory grounds for new trial motion]; thurmond v. superior court of solano county under section 1182 of the penal code an application for a new trial must be made before judgment or within 20 days after the making of an order granting probation, whichever first occurs it further appears that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying post-judgment motions on the merits. johnson complained in his post-judgment motions that based on mere circumstantial evidence the however, as to the type of evidence presented, judicial council of california criminal jury instructions (2016) calcrim no. both direct and circumstantial evidence are acceptable types of evidence to prove or disprove the 5 elements of a charge, including intent and mental state and acts necessary to a conviction, and neither is necessarily more reliable than the other. neither is entitled to any greater and as we recorded , the jury convicted him of assault with an enhancement for personal firearm use, not an enhancement for having inflicted great bodily injury. the evidence demonstrated that he shot at the victim at one point, and stuck the barrel of his shotgun in her mouth at another point. (see people v. white (2015) 241 cal.app.4th 881, actually results in any injury. the focus is on force likely to produce great bodily injury. johnson also complained about how various evidentiary and related trial issues were handled, but he chose to represent himself at trial (as was his right under faretta v. california (1975) 422 u.s. 806 [95 s.ct. 2525]), and claim of ineffective assistance of counsel on his own shortcomings. [cipeople v. blair (2005) 36 cal.4th 686, 734, disapproved on other grounds in people v. black (2014) 58 cal.4th 912, 919-920.) johnson was represented by counsel at sentencing, but the sentencing issues he raised in his post-judgment motions concerned the fact that his assault term was doubled under the three strikes law, claims that seem plainly without merit. johnson alleged the prosecution violated the eighth amendment by charging three strikes prior conviction allegations it could not prove, that he never admitted any qualifying three strikes priors, and that the jury never found any prior strike allegations to be true. but johnson is forgetting that, as confirmed by the during the bifurcated aspect of his trial he waived his right to a jury trial on the prior conviction allegations and, at the ensuing court trial, the court found the allegations to be true.3 johnson complained that the use of his 1978 aggravated assault conviction to qualify him for 3 priors and priors were found true on 4-20- 6 treatment under the three strikes law amounted to an illegal bill of attainder.is incorrect both legally (see people v. venegas (1970) 10 cal.app.3d 814, 823 . . prior to effective date [citation] . . . do and factually (the trial court here dismissed the 1978 prior conviction finding and used a post-19944 conviction to sentence johnson as a second-striker). we are satisfied that defense counsel has fully complied with the responsibilities we have delegated and that no arguable appellate issue exists. (smith v. robbins (2000) 528 u.s. 259, 278 [120 s.ct. 746]; people v. kelly (2006) 40 cal.4th 106, 110.) 4 strikes law was enacted twice in 1994, first by the legislature people v. johnson (2015) 61 cal.4th 674, 681, fn. 1.) it appears from his motions that johnson was convicted for aggravated assault in 2002 and/or in 2005. on february 16, 2016, we took judicial notice of a trial court minute order dated april court finds that the defendant has suffered the two alleged strikes. [] the court strikes prior a333440 for the purposes of sentencing[ ] only pursuant to penal code section 1385 and strikes all prison priors pursuant to penal code section 1385 for the following reasons: [] 1) due to the age of a333440 case; 2) no one was injured and evidence indicates defendant shot over heads of people involved. 7 disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports edmon, p. j. we concur: aldrich, j. hogue, j. judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
