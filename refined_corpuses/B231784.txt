(jackson v. virginia (1979) 443 u.s. 307, 318-319; people v. johnson (1980) 26 cal.3d 557, 575-578; people v. rodriguez (1999) 20 cal.4th 1, 11.) we do not re- 4 evaluate the credibility of the witnesses, and we must presume the existence of every fact the jury could reasonably deduce from the evidence. (people v. avila (2009) 46 cal.4th 680, 701; people v, kraft (2000) 23 cal.4th 978, 1053; people v. koontz (2002) 27 cal.4th 1041, 1078.) the jury was instructed on the elements of simple kidnapping and the elements of attempt.1 in an attempted kidnapping, the prosecution must show that the defendant intended to move the victim some appreciable distance before abandoning the effort. asportation simply is not an people v. cole (1985) 165 cal.app.3d 41, 50.) the to move the victim must usually be inferred from circumstantial evidence. (id. at p. 48; people v. davis (2009) 46 cal.4th 539, 606.) for example, in people v. fields (1976) 56 cal.app.3d 954, this court upheld a conviction of attempted kidnapping even though the victim was never physically moved: the attempt was abandoned when the victim threatened to scream after the defendant grabbed her by the hair and told her to get into his car. (idsuggest that defendant contemplated no more than a trivial movement of his victim, the id. at p. 957.) the ground. he tried to soothe the crying, collecting his puppy, appellant headed toward an exit gate: deandre thought appellant reet with brianna clutched in his arms. (see 1 t the defendant is guilty of this crime, the people must prove that: one, the defendant took a direct but ineffective step towards committing kidnapping; and, two, the defendant dnapping, the people must prove that: one the defendant took, held or detained another person by using force or by instilling reasonable fear; two, using that force or fear, the defendant moved the other person a substantial distance; and, three, the other person did not consent 5 people v. dillon appellant did not release brianna even after deandre tackled him and they fell onto the lawn, clinging tightly to brianna while deandre tried to pull his sister to safety. as brian hold on brianna until forced to do so by brian s. the children were petrified with fear. the jury could reasonably infer that appellant intended to kidnap brianna based with his of affection; his forceful grabbing of the child and refusal to let go despite her pleas to be released; his movements toward the exit gate with brianna in his arms; and the proximity appellant was ready to flee with brianna, prompting deandre to jump on appellant to stop the kidnapping. appellant did not abandon his efforts to take brianna until forced to do so by an adult male. this was, beyond a reasonable doubt, a kidnapping attempt. 2. attempted false imprisonment instruction appellant did not requestand the trial court did not givean instruction on attempted false imprisonment.2 ffreedom of movementpeople v. bamba (1997) 58 cal.app.4th 1113, 1121.) appellant argues sented at trial was legally insufficient to convict appellant of attempted kidnapping, there was substantial evidence to support jury instructions on 2 guilty of this crime, the people must prove that: 1. the defendant intentionally [and unlawfully] restrained, confined, or detained someone; and 2. the defendant made the an attempted false imprisonment does not require a present ability or personal presence, though it does require a specific intent to commit the crime. (people v. ross (1988) 205 cal.app.3d 1548, 1554.) 6 he maintains that the trial court had a duty to instruct the jury on the crime of attempted false imprisonment as a lesser included offense of attempted kidnapping. a lesser offense is necessarily included in a greater offense if either the statutory elements of the greater offense, or the facts actually alleged in the information include all of the elements of the lesser offense, so that the greater offense cannot be committed without also committing the lesser offense. (people v. birks (1998) 19 cal.4th 108, 117; people v. rundle (2008) 43 cal.4th 76, 143.) respondent concedes that a person who has the specific intent to detain and move a victim, as required for an attempted required for an attempted false imprisonment. it is well established that false so in order to restrain the personal liberty of his victim (pen. code,  236), whatever his purpos(people v. ratcliffe (1981) 124 cal.app.3d 808, 820-821.)3 even if attempted false imprisonment is a lesser included offense of attempted kidnapping, a sua sponte instruction evidence establishes that defendant was either guilty of kidnapping or was not guilty at people v. ordonez, supra, 226 cal.app.3d at p. 1233. see also, people v. vargas (2001) 91 cal.app.4th 506, 546 and people v. morrison (1964) 228 cal.app.2d 707, 713 [the trial court need not instruct on a lesser included offense if the evidence is such that the defendant, if guilty at all, was guilty of something beyond the lesser offense].) the trial court mus 3 see also people v. magana (1991) 230 cal.app.3d 1117, 1120-1121; people v. shadden (2001) 93 cal.app.4th 164, 171; people v. ordonez (1991) 226 cal.app.3d 1207, 1233; people v. patrick (1981) 126 cal.app.3d 952, 965; people v. gibbs (1970) 12 cal.app.3d 526, 547; and people v. chacon (1995) 37 cal.app.4th 52, 65. 7 defendant is guilty only people v. birks, supra, 19 cal.4th at p. 118, italics added.) the evidence in this case does not support a theory that defendant was guilty only of attempted false imprisonment. appellant exercised physical force in snatching up brianna and clutching her to him, refusing to release her despite her tears, screams, and ly toward an exit gate, getting ready to run away with brianna in his arms. the kidnapping was thwarted by deandre. there was no substantial evidence that appellant planned to remain in brian er will. the evidence showed that appellant picked up briana in an attempt to move the child a substantial distance, i.e., to his home 10 or 15 blocks away, by reasonable inference. 3. conduct credit appellant contends that his conduct credits were not properly calculated. at sentencing, he received 333 days of presentence custody credit, consisting of 290 days of actual custody and 43 days of conduct credit. respondent concedes that appellant did not receive enough conduct credit because the trial couattempted kidnapping is not a violent felony. (pen. code,  667.5, subd. (c).) appellant should be deemed to have served a term of four days for every two days spent in actual custody. (pen. code,  4019, subd. (f); people v. fry (1993) 1334, 1340-1341.) as a result, his conduct credit is 144 days, for a total of 434 days of presentence credit. 4. dna penalty assessment the trial court imposed a $20 dna penalty assessment, as well as a $200 restitution fine, and a $200 parole restitution fine. a dna penalty cannot be levied on imposed restitution fines, no dna assessment is allowed. disposition the judgment is modified to reflect conduct credit of 144 days, plus 290 days of actual custody, for a total of 434 days of precommitment credit. the judgment is also 8 modified to strike the $20 dna penalty assessment. as so modified, the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. boren, p.j. we concur: ashmann-gerst, j. chavez, j.
