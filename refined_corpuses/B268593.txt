(a)(1)), and, on october 20, 2015, she pleaded no contest to that offense and admitted a great bodily injury allegation ( 12022.7). that same day, she was sentenced to two years in prison and to three years under section 12022.7, subdivision (a), but the three-year term was stayed. thereafter, on november 18, 2015, the case was called for a restitution hearing. mcmillan did not want restitution, but he did want a protective order. the court issued a criminal protective order for mcmillan under section 136.2, based on a finding that walp and mcmillan knew each other. walp was prohibited from harassing, striking, threatening, assaulting, 1 all further undesignated statutory references are to the penal code. 3 following, stalking, molesting, destroying or damaging personal or real property, disturbing the peace, surveilling or blocking the movements of mcmillan. she was ordered not to contact or to come within 100 yards of him. defense counsel objected to the protective order pending. counsel pointed out that walp had already been sentenced and that this was not a domestic violence case. the court overruled the objection and issued the order, which remains in effect until approximately november 18, 2018. this appeal followed. discussion to protect a witness or a victim, a trial court may issue a protective order in a criminal case. ( 136.2; people v. ponce (2009) 173 cal.app.4th 378, 38during the pendency of a criminal proceeding when the court has t (people v. selga (2008) 162 cal.app.4th 113, 118.) witnesses in connection with the criminal proceeding in which the restraining order is issued in order to allow participation by the purposes it seeks to accomplish in the criminal under section 136.2 [are] operative only during the pendency of id. at pp. 118-119; accord, people v. stone (2004) 123 cal.app.4th 153, 159.) a protective order, however, may be ordered against a defendant sentenced to prison when the defendant has been convicted of 4 domestic violence or as a condition of probation. (ponce, at pp. 382-383; people v. robertson (2012) 208 cal.app.4th 965, 996;  136.2, subd. (i)(1).) here, the trial court expressly found that this was moreover, there was no evidence that this was a domestic violence case. mcmillan had not seen walp for two years before inviting her to stay at his place, which he did because she was down on her luck. also, the protective order could not have been imposed as a condition of probation, because probation was denied and walp was sentenced to prison. we therefore conclude that because the protective order under section 136.2 was issued after judgment had been pronounced and walp sentenced, the court had no authority to issue it. (people v. ponce, supra, 173 cal.app.4th at p. 382 [the limitation is jurisdictional].) the order must be stricken.2 notwithstanding that the order is stricken, we note that the minute order of november 18, 2015 mistakenly states that the order was issued under section 646.9, subdivision (k). it was not issued under that section and therefore the minute order must be corrected. 2 although appellant asks us to order the abstract of judgment be corrected, the abstract of judgment in the record on appeal does not reflect that a protective order was issued. 5 disposition the minute order dated november 18, 2015 shall be corrected to reflect that the protective order was issued under section 136.2 and not under section 646.9, subdivision (k). the protective order is reversed and stricken. not to be published in the official reports aldrich, j. we concur: edmon, p. j. lavin, j.
