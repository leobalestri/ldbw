[citation.] (people v. hester (2000) 22 cal.4th 290, 294.) few if any crimes, however, are the result of a single physical act. section 654 has been applied 2 the state of california apparently issues and uses e.b.t. cards to dispense funds to persons receiving benefits from various state programs. 4 not only where there was but one act in the ordinary sense . . . but also where a course of conduct violated more than one statute and the problem was whether it comprised a divisible transaction which could be punished under more than one statute within the meaning of section 654.]people v. latimer (1993) 5 cal.4th 1203, 1208.) whether a course of criminal conduct is divisible and therefore gives rise to more than one act within the meaning of section 654 depends on the intent and objective of the actor. if all of the offenses were incident to one objective, the defendant may be punished for any one of such offenses but not for more than one.people v. latimer, supra, 5 cal.4th at p. 1208.) he question of whether defendant harbored a (people v. harrison (1989) 48 cal.3d 321, 335.) the question whether section 654 is factually applicable to a given series of offenses is for the trial court, and the law gives the trial court broad latitude in making this determination. its findings on this question must be upheld on appeal if there is any substantial evidence to support them.people v. hutchins (2001) 90 cal.app.4th 1308, 1312.) f a defendant commits two crimes, punishment for one of which is precluded by section 654, that section requires the sentence for one conviction to be imposed, and the other imposed and then stayed. [citation.] section 654 does not allow any multiple punishment, whether concurrent or consecutivepeople v. deloza (1998) 18 cal.4th 585, 594.) in people v. williams (2009) 170 cal.app.4th 587, the trial court found that the conduct underlying the debut imposed a concurrent term on the possession of a firearm by a felon count rather than staying that term under section 654. (id. at p. 646.) the court of appeal reversed, he trial court . . . erred under section 654 in imposing a concurrent term rather conviction. (id. at pp. 645-646; see also people v. jones (2012) 54 cal.4th 350, 357 [in a 5 section 654 case concerning multiple punishment for illegal firearm possession, the california supreme court cited, with apparent approval, the holding in people v. williams which it characterized as: possession of a firearm by a felon and possession of a controlled substance while ) while there may be room to affirm a trial court that does not stay a sentence on in possession of a firearm and possession of methamphetamine while armed offenses (see people v. vang (2010) 184 cal.app.4th 912, 915-917 [not the case here. -possession of a controlled substance with a firearm conviction and stated it was basically, the same incident or same course of conduct underlying his convictions for possession of a controlled substance while armed and possession of a firearm by a felon arose from the same course of conduct is supported by substantial evidencei.e., defendant, a felon, possessed the controlled substance and firearm together in his bedroom and did not provide testimony that would support a finding that he possessed the firearm for an intended purpose different from his methamphetamine possession. (people v. hutchins, supra, 90 cal.app.4th at p. 1312.) accordingly, based on that finding, the trial court should not have imposed a concurrent sentence on on of a firearm by a felon, but, instead, should have stayed the sentence on that conviction under section 654. (people v. williams, supra, 170 cal.app.4th at pp. 645-646; see people v. jones, supra, 54 cal.4th at p. 357.) 6 disposition ce on his conviction for possession of a firearm by a felon is stayed pursuant to section 654, and his abstract of judgment is ordered modified accordingly. d not to be published in the official reports raphael, j. we concur: turner, p. j. kriegler, j. judge of the superior court of the county of los angeles, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
