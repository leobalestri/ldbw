( 1237.5, 1538.5, subd. (m); people v. avalos (1996) 47 cal.app.4th 1569, 1576; people v. whitfield (1996) 46 cal.app.4th 947, 959.) section 995 following a guilty or no contest plea, as the plea admits all the elements of the offense and therefore resolves the issue of probable cause. (people v. brown (1971) 18 cal.app.3d 1052, 1054-1055.) defendant entered a plea of no contest in return for an agreed upon sentence, and therefore the terms of the sentence may not be reviewed on appeal. (people v. panizzon (1996) 13 cal.4th 68, 78-79.) accordingly, the only issues before this court are the first two raised by defendantthat there was no cause for the officers to approach or search defendant and justification of the search as a condition of parole was improper because there was no evidence other than hearsay that defendant was a parolee. both contentions lack merit. 4 review challenges to the admissibility of evidence obtained by police searches and seizures under federal constitutional standards.

(people v. meredith (1992) 11 cal.app.4th 1548, 1561, fn. 8.) merely knocking on a motel room door does not constitute a search or seizure. no search took place until defendant admitted he was on parole and consented to the search of the room. suevidence that he was a parolee is mistaken. not only did the officers conduct a computer we have examined the entire appellate record, as well as the superior court file in this case. no arguable issues exist that are cognizable on appeal after a plea of no contest. moreover, none of the non-search issues raised by defendant provide any basis for a find of error or prejudice. the judgment is affirmed.
