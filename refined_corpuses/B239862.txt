[her] family to be broken just bt.d. would try not to fall asleep, and sometimes she felt safe if her sister was sleeping orellana was doing to her seemed normal. in 2005, when she was in fifth grade at a catholic school, t.d. got caught cheating told the teacher that because she was afraid of orellana. the teacher took t.d. to the office and the principal called the police, who came to the school. when t.d. was talking to the police she could t.d. left the school with her mother, orellana, and j., and went to the police ies, which made t.d. feel after her 2005 report, orellana continued to touch t.d. while they were in the ana touching her under or over her underwear and putting his fingers inside her. when t.d. was in high school and they had moved to a house in pomona, orellana tried to put his penis in her mouth when she was lying on her side on the couch. 5 orellana was sitting next to her head and got underneath her, putting his hands on her head and trying to put his penis in her mouth, but she did not let his penis go past her teeth. t.d. left without a struggle. t.d. kept a diary while she lived in the house in pomona, which she never intended anyone else to read. on august 4, 2009, she wrote that orellana had disconnected her phone and she hated him because he had molested her in third grade. in an entry dated august 29, 2009, she wrote that the night before she fell asleep, and orellana put his fingers in her vagina, sucked on her nipples, and put his penis in her orellana put his fingers in her vagina and made her bleed. t.d. also wrote about drinking before she has been happening to [her]. nobody would listen to [her] or hear [her], so [she] would in december 2009, t.d. told her boyfriend a.n.happened with orellana. matt told twent to the pomona police station and made a report to two policemen on july 26, 2010. she later gave her diary to a detective. orellana moved out of the home and did not come back. he never threatened or harmed t.d. after she reported the abuse. she was scared december 2009. t.d. told him that orellana would touch her breasts and vagina (to the point where once she fought back), had placed his fingers in and licked her vagina, and tried to make her suck his penis. her stories were consistent, and she would always cry. nd file a report. 6 after they picked t.d. up, they went to the west covina police department, where they mother would take them to the pomona police, so he called his mother, who drove matt and t.d. over to the pomona police department. elementary school in 2005, testified that t.d. said that in april 2004, she was awakened by orellana holding her legs, with her shorts pulled down but her panties still on. teacher told the deputies that t.d. told her that on june 4, 2004, they were watching tv in the living room when orellana grabbed her chest under her clothing. t.d. had not told investigating officer closed the case on the same day it was assigned; the detective did not remember the reason it was closed. mother had just come back from the market when t.d. came into the room and said, told him t.d. was saying he touched her, and asked t.d. how he touched her. t.d. put her hand in front of her leave the room. orellana denied that he did anything to her. t.d. came back in and mother asked orellana to leave, and after a few days he did. d their mother that 7 told their mother she was just going along with t.d. in jubeen drinki detective richard machado testified that he was the investigating officer from the pomona police department. t.d. had given him her diary at the beginning of the investigation. detective machado observed through a one-way mirror an interview with away from orellana when he touched her, and because she was intimidated by his size the guts . . . clinical psychologist dr. jayme bernfeld testified regarding a model called child sexual abuse accommodation syndrome, developed by a psychiatrist to help people understand the behavior of model posits that the sexual abuse of children occurs in secrecy, with no witnesses. the child victim is physically helpless because the child is much smaller, and is socially helpless because the child has been taught to do what it is told to do. the child tends to accommodate the abuse to be able to live with it, including using alcohol or drugs to numb the pain as the child gets older. most child victims never disclose; and those who do, disclose it many years later. many child victims recant, motivated by the negative pressure they experience as a result of their disclosure, which can cause a lot of trouble in the family. the closer the relationship between the child victim and the perpetrator, the more difficult disclosure becomes. child victims do not often disclose the entirety of the abuse all at once. 8 never touched her inappropriately. when she told her mother that he had touched her inappropriately, she was just going along with t.d. to support her by lying; they were a., 25 at the time of trial, also testified. orellana moved in when she was 16 and she left home when she was 22; she was not close to him. t.d. called a. the day she told her mother about the sexual abuse and asked a. to come get her, but instead a. went over to the house later that night. t.d. told a. that orellana had liar. t.d. never said anything again, and a. had never seen orellana behave inappropriately. after testimony ended, the defense moved to dismiss or reduce the charges because there was insufficient evidence of force, violence, duress or fear to support convicting orellana of forcible lewd acts, aggravated sexual assaultoral copulation, aggravated sexual assault, and sexual penetration by a foreign object. the court denied the motion. the jury found orellana guilty on all 10 counts. discussion i. orellana argues that the evidencharged offenses in all but counts 1 and 15 was insufficient to support his convictions for forcible lewd act upon a child (counts 2, 10, 11, and 12), aggravated sexual assault of a childoral copulation (count 6), aggravated sexual assault of a child (count 7), and sexual penetration by a foreign object (counts 13 and 14). we conclude that the evidence was sufficient. we apply the substantial evidence standard, examining the evidence in the light most favorable to the judgment, and determining whether the evidence is reasonable, credible, and of solid value so as to allow a reasonable trier of fact to find the defendant 9 guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. (people v. prince (2007) 40 cal.4th 1179, 1251.) the question is not whether we believe that the evidence establishes guilt beyond a reasonable doubt; instead, we review the evidence favorably to the prosecution to determine whether any rational jury could have reached the verdict that it did. (jackson v. virginia (1979) 443 u.s. 307, 318is present, no matter how slight it may appear in comparison with the contradictory in re gustavo m. (1989) 214 cal.app.3d (people v. moye hypothesis whatever is there sufficient substantial eviden(people v. racy (2007) 148 cal.app.4th 1327, 1332.) a. forcible lewd act upon a child (counts 2, 10, 11, and 12) the elements of a section 288, subdivisions (a) and (b)(1), offense are: (1) physical touching of a child under 14 years old; (2) for the present and immediate purpose of sexually arousing or gratifying the defendant or the victim; and (3) the touching was accomplished by use of force, violence, duress, menace or fear of injury. (people v. alvarez (2002) 27 cal.4th 1161, 1171.) force in this context means physical people v. soto (2011) 51 cal.4th 229, 242; accord, people v. griffin (20people v. alvarez isjunctive, so the prosecution need prove only that force or duress was used to accomplish the lewd act. (soto, at p. 236.) in the context of a sex crime with a hardship or retribution sufficient to coerce a reasonable person of ordinary susceptibilities to (1) perform an act which otherwise would not have been performed or, (2) acquiesce in people v. leal (2004) 33 cal.4th 999, 1004, italics omitted.) the jury was so instructed. the jury was 10 also instructed that it could take into account the age of the victim and her relationship to the defendant. orellana contends there is insufficient evidence in counts 2, 10, 11, and 12 to support the jury's verdict that he used force, violence, duress, menace, or fear of injury. thus, he asserts, the verdicts regarding those four counts should be modified to reflect convictions of the lesser included offense of nonforcible lewd conduct on a child under 14 under section 288, subdivision (a), and he should be resentenced accordingly. we reject this argument. was in fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh grade, when she fell asleep on the living room couch and he touched her after the rest of the family had gone to bed. t.d. testified that estimony is evidence that orellana used more force than was necessary to touch her, by keeping his arms around her and making it hard for her to get away. t.d. also testified that she was afraid to tell orellana to stop, and did not tell her family because she was afraid the family would be broken up. this constitutes evidence of he exercised over her and was not the result of freely given consent. [fn. omitted.] under these circumstances, given the age and size of the victim, her relationship to the defendant, and the implicit threat that she would break up the family if she did not people v. veale (2008) 160 cal.app.4th 40, 48.) a reasonable jury could have found orellana used force or duress as to counts 2, 10, 11, and 12. people v. espinoza (2002) 95 cal.app.4th 1287 (espinoza) does not require that we conclude that the evidence was insufficient to support a conviction on any of the four counts alleging a violation of section 288, subdivision (b). the prosecutor in espinoza argued only duress in support of the count alleging a violation of section 288, subdivision (b). (id. at p. 1319.) as we explain above, there was sufficient evidence of force in 11 counts 2, 10, 11, and 12, and so we need not reach the issue whether the convictions were sustainable on duress alone. (people v. mejia (2007) 155 cal.app.4th 86, 102.) further, we note that the victim in espinoza was 12, and she reported the abuse charged in the section 288, subdivision (b) count within a day of its occurrence. (espinoza, at pp. 12921293.) here, the abuse in counts 2, 10, 11 and 12 began when t.d. was in third or fourth grade. further, when she first told her fifth-grade teacher about the abuse, she wanted the teacher to tell her mother because she was afraid of orellana. orellana told the police he thing, and orellana continued his abuse of t.d. this supports an inference that orellana psychologically controlled t.d., first abusing her when she was very young and afraid he might do something worse, two years later obtaining her continued submission and silence by denying any abuse in her presence after she mustered the courage to tell her teacher, and then people v. veale, supra, 160 cal.app.4th at p. 48; people v. cochran (2002) 103 cal.app.4th 8, 15.) b. aggravated assault of a child (counts 6 and 7) count 6 charged orellana with aggravated sexual assault of a childoral copulation, in violation of section 269, subdivision (a)(4), and count 7 charged aggravated assault of a childsexual penetration, in violation of section 269, subdivision nine years old. she was in third grade, orellana entered her bedroom when she was sleeping in bed. she woke up with her shorts unbuttoned and pulled down, and felt orellana touching, licking and putting his fingers inside her vagina. t.d. stayed quiet because she was scared. orellana was side to block his access, but although that made it more difficult for him, orellana continued to touch her for 10 minutes. 12 like the offense of forcible lewd acts upon a child under 14, the offense of duress, menace, or fear of immediate and unlawful bodily injury on the victim or another people v. cochran, supra, 103 cal.app.4th at p. 13.) section 269 is subject to the definitions of force and duress provided in section 288, and the cases interpreting it. (people v. alvarez, supra, 178 cal.app.4th at p. 1004.) there was substantial evidence of force. a reasonable jury could conclude from overcame that resistance by using physical force substantially different from that required to touch, lick, and finger her vagina. further, there was evidence that t.d. told the deputy during the interview at her elementary school that in april 2004 she was awakened by orellana holding her legs, which supports an inference of use of force. there was also substantial evidence of duress to support the convictions on counts 6 and 7. t.d. was in third grade, and orellana was an adult and her stepfather; this large age discrepancy, and the family relationship, is evidence of duress. (people v. cochran, supra, 103 cal.app.4th at p. 15; people v. senior (1992) 3 cal.app.4th 765, 775.) (people v. superior court (kneip) (1990) 219 cal.app.3d 235, 238.) a rational jury could find people v. soto, supra, 51 cal.4th at pp. 245246.) further, t.d. testified that she feared retribution, and remained still so orellana would not do anything worse. this is ample evidence to support duress. a reasonable jury could have found orellana used force or duress as to counts 6 and 7. c. forcible penetration by a foreign object (counts 13 and 14) counts 13 and 14 each charged a violation of section 289, subdivision (a)(1), when she was 14 and in eighth grade. 13 october 19, 2009, when she was also 14, describing how on that day orellana put his fingers in her vagina and made her bleed. like the statutes criminalizing sexual assault or lewd acts on a child under 14, section 289, subdivision (a)(1) requires that the act be we concluded above that the evidence was sufficient to support a finding that the sexual abuse when t.d. was under 14 occurred under duress. the same substantial evidence supports the jury verdicts regarding these two incidents when t.d. was 14; evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict, a rational jury could conclude that the abuse in counts 13 and 14 was accomplished by means of duress. ii. on appeal, orellana arguesand respondent concedesthat he was improperly convicted of count 1, continuous sexual abuse of t.d. between december 17, 2003 and december 16, 2004, in violation of section 288.5, and the two acts of aggravated sexual assault of a child in violation of section 269, also between december 17, 2003 and december 16, 2004 (counts 6 and 7). the trial court in this case sentenced orellana to concurrent sentences of 15 years to life on counts 6 and 7, and stayed the sentence on count 1 under section 654. section 288.5, subdivision (c) provideconduct . . . involving the same victim may be charged in the same proceeding with a charge under this section unless the other charged offenses occurred outside the time period charged under this section or the othecounts 1, 6, and 7 all involved the time period between december 17, 2003 and [this] . . . conviction or the convictions people v. johnson (2002) 28 cal.4th 240, 248, 245.) while both parties agree that the convictions for both continuous sexual abuse and for the two acts during the same period were prohibited by section 288.5, subdivision 14 (c), they disagree on the remedy. orellana argues that his sentences on count 6 (15 years to life) and count 7 (15 years to life, to be served concurrently with the sentence on count 6) should be vacated, counts 6 and 7 should be dismissed, and the case should be count 1 (continuous sexual abuse) should be vacated and count 1 should be dismissed, leaving standing the more severe sentences imposed on counts 6 and 7. in people v. johnson, supra, 28 cal.4th 240, the california supreme court did not address or decide which of the multiple convictions should be reversed, the continuous sexual abuse or the five specific sexual offenses during the same period. instead, the offenses. (id. at pp. 244245, 248.) following people v. johnson, presiding justice roger boren of this appellate district conc288.5, adopted to prevent child molesters from evading conviction, could be used by those molesters to circumvent multiple convictions with more severe penalties . . . than available for a conviction under section people v. alvarez (2002) 100 cal.app.4th 1170, 11771178.) in people v. torres (2002) 102 cal.app.4th 1053, 1059, remedy for a violation of the proscription against multiple convictions set forth in section 288.5, subdivision (c) . . . we leave appellant standing convicted of the alternative in this case, the two counts of aggravated sexual assault carry a greater aggregate penalty than the penalty for continuous sexual abuse. each of counts 6 and 7 carried an indeterminate sentence of 15 years to life in state prison. ( 269, subd. (b).) the penalty for continuous sexual abuse of a child is a term of 6, 12, or 16 years in state prison. ( 288.5, subd. (a).) in accord with people v. alvarez and people v. torres,3 we will leave in place the convictions on the alternative offenses that are most commensurate 3 cases. 15 with his culpability, i.e., his convictions on counts 6 and 7. we therefore vacate disposition resentencing. in all other respects, the judgment is affirmed. not to be published. johnson, j. i concur: chaney, j.rothschild, acting p. j., concurring: the record shows each count is supported by substantial evidence that defendant used force. i therefore believe it is unnecessary to consider whether duress also supports the convictions. rothschild, acting p. j.
