(a)),1 two counts of identity theft ( 530.5) and one count of false impersonation ( 529, subd. (a)(3)) and admitted he had suffered a prior serious and/or violent felony conviction for sexual penetration by force ( 289, subd. (a)(1)). dadanian was sentenced to an aggregate state prison term of eight years four months and ordered to pay $9,189 in victim restitution ( 1202.4, subd. (f)). representing himself, on may 4, 2017 dadanian petitioned to recall his sentence and for resentencing of his three felony grand theft convictions as misdemeanors under proposition 47, the safe neighborhoods and schools act ( 1170.18). at a hearing on june 7, 2017 the trial court appointed the dadanian. the people opposed the petition, and the court denied it, finding that dadanian had suffered a prior disqualifying conviction and the amount of the loss exceeded $950, making him ineligible for resentencing under proposition 47. dadanian filed a timely notice of appeal. we appointed counsel to represent dadanian on appeal. after examination of the record counsel filed an opening brief in which no issues were raised. on february 20, 2018 we advised dadanian he had 30 days within which to submit any contentions or issues he wished us to consider. we have received no response. 1 statutory references are to this code. 3 discussion proposition 47 reduced certain drug- and theft-related offenses from felonies to misdemeanors for offenders who do not have prior convictions for specified violent or serious offenses. proposition 47, codified in new section 1170.18, also permits eligible inmates serving sentences for a reclassified crime to petition the court for resentencing.
