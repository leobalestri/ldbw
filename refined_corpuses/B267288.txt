held appellant to answer for attempted willful, deliberate, and premeditated murder. the magistrate indicated there was sufficient evidence for an 6 additional count but did not specify what it was, and the people indicated they would file it in the information. the information filed august 22, 2014, alleged as count 1 that appellant committed attempted willful, deliberate, and premeditated murder with firearm use (pen. code,  12022.5, subd. (a)). count 2 alleged appellant committed the offense of shooting at an inhabited dwelling (pen. code,  246).3 at all times prior to february 10, 2015, appellant was represented by retained counsel. on february 10, 2015, the court relieved retained counsel and appointed the public on july 13, 2015, appellant filed a penal code section 995 motion on the ground there was insufficient evidence that a crime was committed and that appellant was guilty of it. appellant argued that when he fired at the door he could not have intended to kill garcia because garcia testified he was in bed when he heard what he thought were gunshots, and that garcia ignored them and went back to sleep. on july 14, 2015, the people filed an opposition. an amended information, filed august 13, 2015, replaced the penal code section 12022.5, subdivision (a) firearm allegation with firearm allegations pursuant to section 12022.53, subdivisions (b) and (c). the amended information realleged 3 on august 25, 2014, defense counsel told the court guilty by reason of insanity. the court appointed two psychiatrists to evaluate appellantoffense. the reports were prepared and each indicated appellant was not legally insane. the record does not reflect further sanity proceedings. 7 counts 1 and 2. it also included three new counts: count 3, assault with a semiautomatic firearm (pen. code,  245, subd. (b)); count 4, assault with a firearm (pen. code,  245, subd. (a)(2)); and count 5, attempted first degree burglary (of (pen. code,  459, 664). as to each of counts 3 through 5, the amended information alleged firearm use (pen. code,  12022.5, subd. (a)). penal code section 995 motion. appellant pled not guilty to the amended information. on august 18, 2015, appellant waived his constitutional rights, was advised of the consequences of his plea, and entered a negotiated plea of no contest to attempted murder. he also admitted he personally used a firearm. during the taking of the plea, appellant stated he had had enough time to speak with counsel about his case. counsel stipulated there was a factual basis for the plea and concurred in the waivers and plea. the advisements and plea were reflected in a plea form signed by appellant and defense counsel. appellant affirmed the interpreter had read and translated the entire form to him. appellant indicated he understood the information on the form, which he had initialed and signed. in one portion initialed by appellant, he stated that, before entering his plea, he had had a full opportunity to discuss with counsel the facts of the case, available defenses, and anything else appellant thought was important to his case. appellant acknowledged that by initialing and signing the form, he was waiving his constitutional rights and subjecting himself to the consequences. the court asked if appellant was est 8 thing for you the court accepted the plea and admission, and found appellant guilty. the court sentenced appellant to prison as previously indicated, awarded him presentence credit, and imposed various fines and fees. at all proceedings appellant was assisted by a spanish interpreter. on september 22, 2015, appellant filed a notice of appeal and a request for a certificate of probable cause. in his request, appellant asserted there was no factual basis for the plea, he was not guilty, and if he had received effective assistance of counsel, he would not have pled no contest. the trial court issued a certificate of probable cause. contentions after examination of the record, appointed appellate counsel filed an opening brief which raised no issues and requested this court to conduct an independent review of the record. by notice filed march 30, 2016, the clerk of this court advised appellant to submit within 30 days any contentions, grounds of appeal, or arguments he wished this court to consider. on june 14, 2016, appellant filed a supplemental opening brief. in it, appellant argues that (1) because taylor did not speak spanish and appellant did not speak english, appellant did not clearly and unequivocally waive his miranda rights, (2) were involuntary in violation of the fifth amendment, and (3) there was no independent corpus delicti supporting his statements. although the trial court executed a certificate of probable cause (pen. code,  1237.5), the certificate does not expand the grounds upon which an appeal can be taken following a no contest plea. the certificate merely establishes a procedure for 9 screening out frivolous claims among issues not waived. (people v. kaanehe (1977) 19 cal.3d 1, 8-9; people v. devaughn (1977) 18 cal.3d 889, 895-896.) can take in a criminal prosecution. . . . as to the merits, the plea is deemed to constitute a judicial admission of every element of the offense charged. [citation.] indeed, it serves as a stipulation that the people need introduce no proof whatever to support the accusation: the plea ipso facto supplies both evidence and verdict. [citation.] (people v. chadd (1981) 28 cal.3d 739, 748.) implied admission that the people have established or can establish every element of the charged offense, thus obviating the need for the people to come forward with any people v. martin (1973) 9 cal.3d 687, 693-694.) a plea of no contest has the same effect as a plea of guilty. (pen. code,  1016, 3d par.) subject to an exception inapplicable here, appellant, by his no contest plea, waived his penal code section 995 motion. (cf. people v. lilienthal (1978) 22 cal.3d 891, 897 (lilienthal).) moreover, appellant, by that plea, waived issues based on miranda (people v. gibbs (1971) 16 cal.app.3d 758, 765) and the fifth amendment (devaughn, 18 cal.3d at pp. 895-896, fn. 6). he also waived sufficiency of the evidence issues (people v. hayton (1979) 95 cal.app.3d 413, 416-417), and corpus delicti issues (see people v. bryant, smith and wheeler (2014) 60 cal.4th 335, 453-454 [corpus delicti rule pertains to evidentiary sufficiency, not admissibility]). he further waived issues of alleged ineffective assistance of counsel during the preliminary hearing. (cf. people v. marlin (2004) 124 cal.app.4th 559, 563-564, 567-568.) 10 under a heading indicating the trial court employed the motion, appellant asserts medrano recovered the discarded weapon and had conversations with appellant at the scene.4 noting medrano did not testify at the preliminary hearing, appellant argues about what medrano told him was inadmissible double hearsay, decision erroneous. again, however, appellant, by his no contest plea, waived his challenge to the this penal code section 995 motion. (cf. lilienthal, supra, 22 cal.3d at p. 897.) testimony by taylor about what he was told was single-level hearsay. its admission into evidence is authorized by proposition 115. (whitman v. superior court (1991) 54 cal.3d 1063, 1067-1068, 1070.) there was no preliminary hearing testimony that medrano conversed with appellant at the scene. even if medrano had done so, any statement by appellant to him would have been admissible under the evidence code section 1220 admissions hearsay exception. review on appeal we have examined the entire record and are satisfied (people v. wende (1979) 25 cal.3d 436, 443; smith v. robbins (2000) 528 u.s. 259, 278-284.) 4 appellant asks this court to take judicial notice of the above asserted facts. there is no need for this court to do so. 11 disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports stratton, j. we concur: edmon, p. j. aldrich, j. judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
