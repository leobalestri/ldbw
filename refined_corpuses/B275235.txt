(a)).2 the trial court found true the allegations he had three prior serious felony convictions and served a prior prison term ( 667.5, subd. (b)), and sentenced him to state prison for 26 years to life under the three strikes law ( 667, subds. (b)-(i), 1170.12). (people v. lopez (mar. 17, 2003, b158522) [nonpub. opn.].) on march 29, 2013, lopez filed a petition for recall of sentence under proposition 36. he argued that possession of a deadly weapon while confined in jail was no longer a serious or violent felony within the meaning of the three strikes law ( 667, subd. (d)(1), 1170.12, subd. (b)(1)), and none of his three prior serious or violent felony convictions disqualified him from having his sentence recalled ( 1170.126, subd. (e)(3); see  667, subd. (e)(2)(c)(iv), 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(c)(iv)). the trial court issued an order to show cause why his sentence should not be recalled. the people acknowledged lopez was eligible for resentencing, but argued he was unsuitable because he posed an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. the people subsequently argued lopez was ineligible for resentencing under commission of the current offense, the defendant . . . was armed with a firearm or deadly weapon . . . 667, subd. (e)(2)(c)(iii), 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(c)(iii).) reviewing the facts of the case, the court found beyond a reasonable doubt that lopez was ineligible for the recall of his sentence because he was armed during the commission of the 2 unless otherwise specified, all further statutory references are to the penal code. 4 shank which was about five inches long, about a quarter inch thick, freshly sharpened to a point, secreted in the light fixture discussion a. applicable law and standard of review proposition 36 was enacted law to the publics original understanding by requiring life sentences only when a defendants current conviction is for a convicted of non-violent, non-serious crimes like shoplifting and simple drug possession [to] receive twice the normal sentence instead of a life sente (voter information guide, gen. elec. (nov. 6, 2012) text of prop. 36,  1.) in order to effectuate this goal, proposition 36 amended sections 667 and 1170.12 and added section 1170.126, which provides that defendants previously sentenced to life terms under the three strikes law may petition to recall their sentences and, if eligible for relief, to be resentenced to a second strike term that would have been imposed for their crime under the new sentencing provisions. ( 1170.126, subd. (a).) a defendant is eligible for resentencing if (1) the current offense is not one defined as a serious or violent felony and is not specified in the three strikes law as a disqualifying conviction, and (2) the defendant has no prior disqualifying convictions. ( 1170.126, subd. (e).) disqualifying convictions include those . . offense, the defendant used a firearm, was armed with a firearm or deadly weapon, or 5 667, subd. (e)(2)(c)(iii), 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(c)(iii); see  1170.126, subd. (e)(2).) to determine whether a defendant meets the statutory eligibility requirements of the act, a trial court examines the entire record of conviction. (people v. estrada (2017) 3 cal.5th 661, 672; people v. hicks (2014) 231 cal.app.4th 275, 286; people v. brimmer (2014) 230 cal.app.4th 782, 800; see also people v. guerrero (1988) 44 cal.3d 343, 355.) application of proposition 36 to the facts presented here is a pure question of law that we review de novo. (people v. oehmigen (2014) 232 cal.app.4th 1, 7 [whether facts in record of conviction establish eligibility for resentencing is a question of law]; see also pasadena police officers assn. v. superior court (2015) 240 cal.app.4th 268, 284 trial courts construction and interpretation of the [law] and its application to undisputed facts present questions of law subject to de novo . . . review].) b. because lopez was armed during the commission of the offense he is ineligible for resentencing [the] exclusion applies when the arming is an element of the offearming in his case was not another crime, he is eligible for relief. he contends that to be armed with a deadly weapon while committing the crime of possession of a deadly . ineligible in the absence of a facilitative nexus to another offense. 6 case law supparguments. to this credit, lopez acknowledges his arguments court to have considered his arguments has rejected them. (see people v. cruz (2017) 15 cal.app.5th 1105, 1111-1112, petn. for review pending, petn. filed nov. 6, 2017; people v. hicks, supra, 231 cal.app.4th at pp. 283-284; people v. brimmer, supra, 230 cal.app.4th at pp. 798-799; people v. elder (2014) 227 cal.app.4th 1308, 1312-1314; people v. osuna (2014) 225 cal.app.4th 1020, 1032.) nonetheless, lopez submits we should depart from these authorities because, as he contends, they misconstrue the meaning of the statute by failing to adequately consider its plain arguments are not persuasive. the phrase statutorily defined and judicially construed to mean having a firearm [or weapon] available for use, either offensively or defensively. [citations.] (people v. cruz, supra, 15 cal.app.5th at pp. 1109-1110, quoting people v. osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1029.) the essence of arming is the availability of, and ready access to, the firearm or weapon. (people v. bland (1995) 10 cal.4th 991, 997; cruz, supra, at p. 1110; osuna, supra, at p. 1029.) applying this principle, numerous courts have held that a defendant is ineligible for resentencing under proposition 36 if he or she was convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm, and the evidence shows the firearm was available for use by the defendant either offensively or defensively. (see, e.g., cruz, supra, at p. 1112; people v. hicks, supra, 231 cal.app.4th at pp. 279-280; people v. brimmer, supra, 230 cal.app.4th at 7 pp. 794-795; people v. blakely (2014) 225 cal.app.4th 1042, 1048-1053; osuna, supra, at p. 1034.) as explained in people v. osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th 1020, because we are not concerned with an arming enhancement, which requires that a defendant be armed in the commission of the offense, proposition 36 from eligibility for lesser punishment if he or she was armed with during . . . . out the continuance or words, it requires a temporal nexus between the arming and the underlying felony, not a facilitative one. the two are not the id. at p. 1032; accord, people v. cruz, supra, 15 cal.app.5th at p. 1111 [arming requires a temporal nexus between the arming and the underlying felony, not a facilitative one. the two are not the same]; people v. white (2016) 243 cal.app.4th 1354, 1363 [prop. 36 requires only that the arming occur during the commission]; people v. hicks, supra, 231 cal.app.4th at pp. 283-284 [unlike [] 12022, which requires in additional punishment to be imposed . . . , [prop. 36] disqualifies an inmate from eligibility for lesser punishment if he or she was d]uring offensepeople v. brimmer, supra, 230 cal.app.4th at pp. 798-799 [prop. 36 requires a temporal nexus between the arming and the underlying felony, not a facilitative one. the two are not ].) ingful difference demonstrated by legislative 8 points to language in people v. bland, supra, 10 cal.4th at p. 1002, where the california supreme court stated that in the commission of the felony offense, . . . implicitly requires both that the arming take place during the underlying crime and that it have some facilitative nexus to that offense. rather than assist gument, blandduringthe temporal requirement of the arming enhancement from the facilitative requirement of in furtherance of the felonyid. at p. 1001.) bland interchangeable. as previously noted, every court that has considered this issue has come to this same conclusion: proposition 36 requires only a temporal nexus, not a facilitative one, and the availability of the weapon determines whether the defendant was armed for purposes of eligibility for resentencing. (people v. hicks, supra, 231 cal.app.4th at p. 284; see also people v. elder, supra, 227 cal.app.4th at p. 1312 ineligibility for resentencing for being armed require something beyond the substantive offense of possession itself.) we agree with these cases and similarly during the commission of the current . consequently, the trial court properly found lopez ineligible for resentencing under proposition 36 because he was armed during the commission of the offense. lopez had a shank hidden in a light fixture which was easily reachable from the upper bunk in his cell. because the weapon was available for use lopez was within the meaning of proposition 36. (people v. bland, 9 supra, 10 cal.4th at pp. 999, 1001-1003; people v. cruz, supra, 15 cal.app.5th at pp. 1109-1110; people v. osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1032.) disposition the order is affirmed. bensinger, j.* we concur: perluss, p. j. zelon, j. * judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
