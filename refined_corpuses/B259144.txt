(a)(2); counts 1, 5), two counts of sexual penetration by foreign object ( 289, subd. (a)(1)(a); counts 2, 3), and one count of assault with intent to commit rape, sodomy, or oral copulation ( 220, subd. (a)(1); count 6).2 for each count, the information also alleged defendant kidnapped the victim within the meaning of the one strike law ( 667.61, subds. (a), (d)(2)). defendant pled not guilty and denied the allegations. after a jury trial at which he did not testify, the jury convicted defendant of all counts and found each allegation true. the court sentenced defendant to 100 years to life. for counts 1 and 5 ( 261, subd. (a)(2); rape) and counts 2 and 3 ( 289, subd. (a)(1)(a); sexual penetration by object), the court sentenced defendant to consecutive one-strike terms of 25 years to life ( 667.61, subds. (a), (d)(2), (i);  667.6, subd. (d)). for count 6 ( 220, subd. (a)(1); 1 all undesignated statutory references are to the penal code. 2 the original information, filed december 27, 2013, alleged counts 1 through 5. on august 15, 2014, the people amended the information by interlineation to add count 6 and to dismiss count 4 ( 664/289, subd. (a)(1)(a); attempted sexual penetration by object) and the related kidnapping allegation. 3 assault with intent to commit sexual penetration by object), the court struck the allegation because count 6 was not a one-strike offense, and imposed the middle term of four years, to run concurrent. defendant filed a timely notice of appeal. factual background on october 19, 2013, b. doe (b.) was working as a cashier during the night shift at the peck minimart in el monte. a friend had dropped her off, and her father would pick her up at the end of the night. she was working alone. a few hours into b.and began asking her increasingly personal questionswhere she lived, who was going to pick her up from work, her phone number, and which door she used to leave. he also asked b. about condoms that were for sale in the market and showed her a tattoo on the back of his neck. after about 20 minutes, defendant left. about an hour later, towards the end of her shift, b. was working in the back storage room when defendant returned. defendant entered the storage room and approached b. he was holding a wire or cord, and held it up to her neck as if he were going to choke her. b. screamed and ran to the front of the store. defendant followed her; he said he was just playing around. b. told him to leave, and he did, walking out the side door. b. locked that door behind him, and ran to lock the other entrance. defendant got there first. as b. tried to lock the front door, defendant forced his way inside the store. he pushed an arcade game across the entrance and turned off the lights.3 then he grabbed b. by the hair, causing her to fall. she dropped her keys and phone; defendant put them in his pocket. 3 on our own motion, we take judicial notice of the trial exhibits in superior court case no. ka103513. (evid. code,  452, subd. (d)(1).) based on our review of exhibits 3 and 4, it appears the arcade game used to blockade the door was , a coin-operated, standing game with an attached steering wheel, housed in a classic arcade cabinet. the game is about the same size as a vending machine. 4 defendant dragged b. into the restroom at the back of the minimart, closed the door, and ordered her to pull down her pants. when she refused, he pulled them down himself. holding b. from behind, defendant pushed his fingers into her vagina with enough force to lift her off the ground. she screamed and tried to push him away. in response, defendant punched her in the face. defendant removed his penis from his pants and forced it into b. next, defendant grabbed a nearby toilet plunger. he plunger handle near [b.] anal area.b. testified that the handle al but did not penetrate the actual anus. after trying and failing to insert the handle into b., defendant dropped the plunger and reinserted his penis into her vagina. while raping her vaginally, defendant removed his shirt, rolled it up, and stuffed it into b.her neck and choked her with it. throughout the ordeal, defendant punched b. in the head and slammed her head into the paper towel dispenser on the adjacent wall. defendant eventually, defendant removed his penis from b.masturbated, and ejaculated into the toilet. at that point, b.took the phone out of his pocket and asked her who kept calling. she replied, just leave, defendant pulled up his pants, told b. to stay in the restroom, and left. as she waited, b. heard defendant move the arcade game away from the front door. she ran outside, where her father and sister were waiting for her in a car.4 when police responded to the peck minimart, they found b. sitting on the curb in front of the store with her father and sister. she was bleeding from the vagina, and had head pain and bruises on her legs. b. was taken to the hospital, where toyetta beukes, a nurse from the sexual assault response team, performed an exam. the exam revealed 4 a surveillance system captured both audio and video footage of the attack. after b. testified, the jury watched the surveillance video, which documented the events outside the restroom, and listened to four five-minute portions of the audio recording. b. is heard crying, screaming, and pleading with defendant to stop. 5 multiple abrasions, tenderness to b.uth, genital tears and abrasions, perianal tears and tenderness, and lacerations and tenderness to the perineum. the next day, b. identified defendant from a six-pack photo array. the minimart b.samples taken from the plunger handle. swabs of b.s and leg indicated the presence of semen. however, those samples did not contain enough male dna to complete a profile. an independent dna analyst conducted a different, more amplified test and concluded defendant was a major contributor to the sample taken from the vulva swab, a contributor to the sample taken from the anal swab, and a possible contributor to the sample taken from the vaginal swab. defendant was arrested on october 26, 2013, one week after the attack. contentions defendant contends that there is insufficient evidence of penetration to support his conviction for count 3, that the jury instructions for counts 2 and 3 misstated the required intent, and that his consecutive one-strike sentences are unauthorized because no reasonable trier of fact could have concluded defendant had a reasonable opportunity to reflect during the attack. discussion 1. sufficiency of the evidence to support the conviction for count 3 defendant was charged in counts 2 and 3 with sexual penetration by foreign object ( 289, subd. (a)(1)(a)). count 3 alleged sexual penetration of the anus with a toilet plunger; count 2 alleged sexual penetration of the vagina with fingers. defendant contends there is insufficient evidence of penetration to support count 3. he argues b.was evidence of trauma to b.injury to the anus itself. the people insist the evidence is sufficient but do not explain how it satisfies the disputed element. as a matter of first impression, we conclude penetration of the perianal area is 6 sufficient to establish sexual penetration of the anal opening, and therefore, there is sufficient evidence to support the verdict. 1.1 sexual penetration by object a criminal defendant may not be convicted of a crime unless the prosecution proves every fact necessary for conviction beyond a reasonable doubt. (u.s. const., 5th amend.; u.s. const., 14th amend.; see cal. const., art. i,  7, 15; in re winship (1970) 397 u.s. 358, 364 [90 s.ct. 1068]; jackson v. virginia (1979) 443 u.s. 307, 316 [99 s.ct. 2781].) irrationality or error by the independent review of the sufficiency of the evidence undertaken by the trial and appellate courts. (united states v. powell (1984) 469 u.s. 57, 67 [105 s.ct. 471].) to convict a defendant of sexual penetration by object, the people must prove: 1. defendant committed an act of sexual penetration with another person; 2. the penetration was accomplished by using a foreign object; 3. the other person did not consent to the act; and 4. defendant accomplished the act by force, violence, duress, menace, or fear of immediate and unlawful bodily injury to another person. ( 289, subd. (a)(1)(a); see calcrim no. 1045.) sexual penetration is the act of causing the penetration, however slight, of the genital or anal opening of any person or causing another person to so penetrate the defendants or another persons genital or anal opening for the purpose of sexual arousal, gratification, or abuse by any foreign ( 289, subd. (k)(1) [emphasis added].) the sexual penetration at issue in count 3 is penetration of the anal opening. defendant contends the plunger handle touchedbut did not penetrateb. anal opening. but the distinction between touching and penetration depends in part on the definition of anal openingand cimplication, that term is not synonymous with anus, either medically or legally. we conclude object penetration requires something more than penetration of the buttocks (see state v. a.m. 7 (wash.ct.app. 2011) 163 wash.app. 414 [penetration of buttocks not sufficient]), but does not require penetration past the anal verge or into the anal canal. 1.2 anal opening the meaning of anal opening e people v. prunty (2015) 62 cal.4th 59, 71.) as with any case involving statutory interpretation, our primary goal is to ascertain and effectuate the people v. park (2013) 56 cal.4th 782, 796.) to determine intent, we first examine the statutory language and give the words their ordinary meaning. (ibidapproved usage of the language; but technical words and phrases, and such others as may have acquired a peculiar and appropriate meaning in law, must be construed 7, subd. (16).) if the statutory language is unambiguous, its plain meaning controls; if the statutory language is ambiguous, we may resort to extrinsic sources, including the ostensible objects to be achieved and the legislative history. [citation.] ultimately we choose the construction that comports most closely with the apparent intent of the lawmakers, with a view to promoting rather than defeating the general purpose of the statute. [citations.] (mays v. city of los angeles (2008) 43 cal.4th 313, 321.) the anus contains two sectionsa mucosa-lined anal canal at the top and an epidermis-lined perianal margin at the bottom.

(tabers cyclopedic medical dictionary (16th ed.1989) p. 1570.) the anal verge connects the bottom of the anal canal to the anal margin.

(see, e.g., 9 people v. gann (1968) 259 cal.app.2d 706, of the crime of sodomy it is uniformly held that it is not necessary to describe the 712 ,section 286 of the penal code, is sufficiently definite to apprise the public generally of the conduct which is prohibited thereby, sic, copulation per anum in light of the terminological confusion, and because neither the courts nor medical professionals have defined anal opening, we turn to cases describing vaginal penetration for guidance. 1.3 construction with related statutes while we look first at the words of a statute, we do not consider statutory language in isolation; rather, we whole, harmonizing the various elements by considering each clause and section in the context of the overall statutory people v. jenkins (1995) 10 cal.4th 234, 246.) we construe all parts of a statute together, without according undue importance to a single or isolated portion. (cooley v. superior court (2002) 29 cal.4th 228.) where statutes are inconsistent, we attempt to provide a harmonious interpretation, and give effect to every provision, so that one section does not destroy another. (people v. jenkins, supra, at p. 246; see 2a sutherland statutory construction (7th ed., rev. apr. 2014)  46:6, pp. 238252.) thus, [a] word or phrase will be given the same meaning each time it appears in a statute . . . . (cooley v. superior court, supra, at p. 255.) and prescribed punishment for the crimes of rape [citations] and sodomy [citations]. . . . [] however, before 1979, there was no felony proscription per se people v. harrison (1989) 48 cal.3d 321, 327328 [footnotes omitted] (harrison).) because section 289 was enacted to treat object penetration as an equally serious violation of statutes. (people v. quintana (2001) 89 cal.app.4th 1362, 13691370; see people v. 10 martinez (1986) 188 cal.app.3d 19, 2225 [discussing history of sodomy statute and its at issue here mirrors the language in the statutes governing rape and sodomy. (harrison, supra, at p. 328.) between the penis of one person and the anus of another person. any sexual penetration, however slight, is sufficient to complete the crime 286, subd. (a).) sexual penetration, in turn, is penetration of the anal opening with the required intent. ( 289, subd. (k)(1).) taken together, the crime of sodomy requires the perpetrator to penetrate the anal opening and to make contact with the anus. to give effect to both requirements, the anus must lie somewhere beyond the anal opening. and, in using identical words to define the analogous act in section 289, the harrison, supra, 48 cal.3d at p. 329.) likewise, 261, subd. (a).) in that context, sexual intercourse refers to vaginal penetration. (people v. stitely (2005) 35 cal.4th 514, 554555.) notwithstanding the apparent meaning, however, vaginal penetration does not require penetration of the vagina itself. (people v. karsai (1982) 131 cal.app.3d 224, 232 (karsai).) genital organs is sufficient to constitute sexual penetration and to complete the crime of (ibid. [victims testimony that defendant pushed his penis between the lips of her vagina was sufficient to support rape conviction]; see also people v. dunn (2012) 205 cal.app.4th 1086, 1097 [relying on karsai, victimmeans any penetration, no matter h.)5 5 karsai was disapproved on other grounds in people v. jones (1988) 46 cal.3d 585, 600, fn. 8. fifteen years after karsai 11 teach of ( 263.) consequently, any sexual penetration, however slight, is sufficient to complete the crime of rape. ( 263; people v. wallace (2008) 44 cal.4th 1032, 1079.) as noted above, it appears the perianal folds, which radiate from the anus, comprise the outer edge of the anus (oes, medical protocol, supra, at appen. m, p. 27); thus, the outer edge of the perianal area forms the edge of the anal opening. yet even if the perianal area merely adjoins the anal opening, it is undoubtedly part of the external anal structurejust as the labia, though not part of the vagina, are part of the external genitalia. defendant has provided us with no reason to treat the anus and the vagina differently. we therefore conclude that sexual penetration requires penetration of the perianal area, but does not require penetration beyond the perianal folds or anal margin. with this definition in mind, we turn to the question before usis the evidence sufficient to support the verdict? we conclude it is. 1.4 there was sufficient evidence defendant penetrated the anal opening. in assessing the sufficiency of the evidence, we review the entire record to determine whether any rational trier of fact could have found the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. (people v. zamudio record must disclose substantial evidence to support the verdicti.e., evidence that is reasonable, credible, and of solid valuesuch that a reasonable trier of fact could find ibid.) in applying this test, we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution and presume in support of the judgment the existence of every fact the jury karsai, supra, 131 cal.app.3d at p. 232), the california suppeople v. holt (1997) 15 cal.4th 619, 675676.) while that construction casts some doubt on karsaidirectly addressed karsais holding, and courts continue to rely on it. 12 could reasonably deduce from the evidence. (people v. kraft (2000) 23 cal.4th 978, 1053.) the same standard applies where the conviction rests primarily on circumstantial evidence. (people v. thompson (2010) 49 cal.4th 79, 113.) we may not reweigh the evidence or resolve evidentiary conflicts. (people v. young (2005) 34 cal.4th 1149, 1181.) accordingly, we may not reverse for insufficient evidence unl people v. bolin (1998) 18 cal.4th 297, 331.) b. testified that defendant tried to insert the plunger handle near the plunger touched her anal area . . . but it go insidewhile the plunger did not penetrate the anus itself, however, it did portion of that area. beukes, the sexual-assault nurse, testified that she observed tenderness and anal tears in the perianal area. also entered into evidence were defendant contends this evidence, taken together, is insufficient to support the verdict. we disagree. first, b. apparently during her testimony. but the required penetration was of the anal opening, not the anus. because the anus lies beyond the anal opening, when the plunger touched the anus, it necessarily penetrated the anal opening. second, 6 examination report, and the plunger itself support a reasonable inference that the plunger handle penetrated the anal opening. beukes testified that she observed tenderness and lacerations in b. perianal area. she 6 part of the skin where it goes from the outer to the testified that the perianal area surrounds the anal area, then that the anus is the perianal area, then that the anus is different from the perianal area; and while beukes mentioned or how it relates to the anus. nevertheless, the testimony does 13 documented the injuries using a modified, commercial version of the official sexual assault form.7 the summary page asks whether visible findings were observed in three areas: the buttocks/perianal, the anus/verge, and the rectum. beukes indicated she observed however, on the relevant diagram, beukes recorded two lacerations in the perianal the diagram is a line drawing depicting the buttocks, anus, and anal opening. a large oval appears at the center and is surrounded by radiating lines forming a sunburst pattern. on the diagram, beukes noted a laceration beginning at the edge of the radiating lines and continuing to the edge of the oval. put another way, it depicts an injury to the anal margin or perineal foldsan injury sufficiently within the anal opening. a photograph of t of the handle are five contiguous plastic knobs, each with a one-inch diameter and a 3.14-inch circumferencelike a string of large, inflexible beads. the jury could have reasonably concluded that friction from the side of one of these knobs produced the laceration beukes saw, and that the tip of the handle penetrated beyond the end of the visible tear. we conclude this evidence, taken together, was sufficient to support conviction for count 3. 2. the instructional error as to counts 2 and 3 defendant contends the court erred by instructing the jury that sexual penetration by object is a general-intent crime. the people concede most appellate opinions 7 minimum legal standards established . . . for performing evidential exaocjp 923 as a required state form. (oes, medical protocol, supra, at pp. iii, 12 & appen. c.) we offer no opinion on whether use of a modified version of that form complies with state law. (see  13823.5, subd. (c) [requiring every healthcare practitioner who conducts a medical examination of a sexual assault victim for evidence of sexual assault to use a standard form to record findings].) 14 conclude section 289 is a specific-intent crime, but nevertheless argue the jury was properly instructed because the trial court could have followed the one opinion that came out the other way. we conclude the court erred but also conclude the people have proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the error was harmless. 2.1 proceedings below as relevant to the claimed error, the court instructed the jury in accordance with calcrim no. 1045 that sexual penetration by force requires the people to prove [t]he the court sexual penetration means penetration, however slight, of the genital or anal opening of the other person . . . for the purpose of sexual abuse, arousal, or gratification. . . . [] penetration for sexual abuse means penetration for the purpose of causi the court also instructed the jury with calcrim no. 252, which described a must prohibited act, but must do so with wrongful intent. a person acts with wrongful intent when he or she intentionally does a prohibited act; however, it is not required that he or she intend to break the law. the act required is explained in the instruction for that cr (calcrim no. 252.) the court went on to explain that count 6, assault with intent to commit sexual penetration by object, required specific intent. 2.2 sexual penetration is a specific-intent crime. defendant contends that because sexual penetration is a specific-intent crime, it was error for the court to include counts 2 and 3 on the list of general-intent crimes. we agree. the crime of sexual penetration by object is a specific-intent crime because it one with the intent to gain sexual arousal or people v. mccoy (2013) 215 cal.app.4th 1510, 1541 (mccoy); accord, people v. zaratecastillo (2016) 244 cal.app.4th 1161, 11671169; people v. ngo (2014) 225 cal.app.4th 126, 157 [ 288.7, sexual penetration with a child, is a specific-intent crime]; people v. senior 15 (1992) 3 cal.app.4th 765, 776 . .) despite the broad agreement on this point, the people contend the instructions were proper because the court could have relied on people v. dillon, which held sexual penetration by object is a general-intent crime. (people v. dillon (2009) 174 cal.app.4th 1367, 1380 (dillon).) it is hornbook law that the d]ecisions of every division of the district courts of appeal are binding upon all . . . auto equity sales, inc. v. superior court (1962) 57 cal.2d 450, 455 (auto equity sales)) must be applied wherever the facts of a case are not fairly distinguishable from the facts of the case in which we have declared the applicable principle of law.people v. triggs (1973) 8 cal.3d 884, 891, disapproved on other grounds in people v. lilienthal (1978) 22 cal.3d 891, 896, fn. 4.) when (auto equity sales, supra, at p. 456.) the people contend dillon and mccoy are one such pair of conflicting opinions, and in light of this conflict, the court was entitled to follow dillon. we disagree. like the two cases at issue in auto equity sales, dillon and mccoy different problemsauto equity sales, supra, 57 cal.2d at p. 457.) dillon, which addressed sexual penetration in the context of an assault charge, concerned the consent. (dillon, supra, 174 cal.app.4th at p. 1378.) significantly, because the parties in dillon agreed section 289 was a general-intent crime, the court did not have occasion to consider the question in detail. (id. at p. 1380; see mccoy, supra, 215 cal.app.4th at p. 1537 [dillon auto equity sales, supra, at pp. 456-457 [noting the arguably-conflicting case was short and did not discuss the precise legal question at issue]; cf. people v. mccarthy (2016) 244 cal.app.4th 1096, 1111 [where party in prior case conceded legal issue, court did not have occasion to consider merits and prior case is not authority for the conceded proposition].) mccoy, 16 on the other hand, analyzed section 289 and the relevant authority in detailand its holding squarely addressed the question in this case: (mccoy, supra, at p. 1538.) in short, the facts and the issue presented in dillon fairly distinguishable from the facts ofthose in mccoy were not. accordingly, under auto equity sales, the court was not entitled to disregard mccoy in favor of dillon. (auto equity sales, supra, at p. 456.)8 2.3 the instructional error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. as discussed, [t]he due process clause protects the accused against conviction except upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which he is charged. [citations.] because due process principles require the prosecution to prove every element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt, jury instructions completely removing the issue of intent froconstitute a denial of federal due process. [citation.] conflicting intent instructionswhere one instruction requires the prosecution to prove intent while another instruction eliminates that requirementcan operate the same way. [citation.] accordingly, [i]f conflicting instructions on the mental state element of an alleged offense can act to federal due process[.] [citation.] offense itself correctly explain the required intent, because we have no way of knowing which of the two irreconcilable instructions the jurors applied in reaching their verdict. [citations.] (people v. valenti (2016) 243 cal.app.4th 1140, 11641165 (valenti).) in this case, we need not determine whether the instructions ,however, because even if the 8 in any event, the court conducted the jury-instruction conference off the record, and there is no evidence the court actually relied on dillon. (see auto equity sales, supra, 57 cal.2d at p. 456 [trial court cited conflicting opinion in passing].) 17 conflicting instructions amounted to a failure to instruct on an element of the offense, the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. (id. at p. 1165; see people v. haley general, rather than specific, intent is federal constitutional error].) we assess federal constitutional errors under chapman v. california (1967) 386 u.s. 18, 24 [87 s.ct. 824] (chapman). under chapman, we must reverse unless the people prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the error complained of did not contribute to the verdict obtained. (ibid.) where the trial court fails to instruct on an element of the charged offense, however, the people must make a more substantial showing. that showing is governed by neder v. united states (1999) 527 u.s. 1, 1719 [119 s.ct. 1827] (nederneder, people v. mil [(2012)] 53 cal.4th 400 [(mil)] . . . . neder instructs us to conduct a thorough examination of the record. if, at the end of that examination [we] cannot conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury verdict would have been the same absent the errorfor example, where the defendant contested the omitted element and raised evidence sufficient to support a contrary finding[we] should not find the error harmless. mil, supra, 53 cal.4th at p. 417, quoting neder, supra, 527 u.s. at p. 19.) on the other hand, the error is harmless if the people can prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the omitted element was uncontested and supported by such overwhelming evidence that no rational juror could come to a different conclusion. [citations.] (valenti, supra, 243 cal.app.4th at pp. 1165-1166.) noting that sexual penetration required him to act of attempted or actual penetration with a foreign object, were very violent and the jury could as well have found those charges were committed for sadistic, rather than sexual be that as it may, require sexual intent.

(k).) b.testimony and the dna evidence both established that upon completion of the attack, defendant masturbated and ejaculated into the nearby toilet. this act alone provides strong evidence of sexual arousal or gratification. we have thoroughly examined the record before us and conclude it contains no (neder, supra, 527 u.s. at p. 19.) accordingly, the people have carried their burden. 3. defendant contends the court erred by imposing consecutive one-strike sentences for counts 1, 2, 3 and 5. because the he argues, ( 667.61, subds. (a), (d)(2), (i);  667.6, subd. (d).) crimes occur on separate occasions of one sex crime and another, the defendant had a reasonable opportunity to reflect upon his or her actions and nevertheless resumed 667.6, subd. (d).) sentence is proper because he tionably had a reasonable opportunity to reflect b. we agree with the people. 3.1 statutory scheme 19 under certain aggravating circumstances, the one strike law ( 667.61) requires courts to impose longer sentences on defendants who commit violent sex crimes like rape ( 261; counts 1 and 5) and sexual penetration by object ( 289, subd. (a)(1)(a); counts 2 and 3). ( 667.61, subd. (c).) as relevant to this case, when a defendant is convicted of a sex offense listed in subdivision (c) and an aggravating factor listed in subdivision (d), subdivision (a) requires the court to sentence him to an indeterminate term of 25 years to life. ( 667.61, subds. (a), (c), (d).) because the jury in this case found the aggravated-kidnapping allegation ( 667.61, subd. (d)(2)) true for counts 1, 2, 3, and 5, the court was required to sentence defendant to an indeterminate one-strike term for each count. (people v. rodriguez (2012) 207 cal.app.4th 204, 213 (rodriguez).) once it determines the law applies, the trial court must decide whether to impose concurrent or consecutive one-strike sentences. while that choice is sometimes discretionary, the court must if the crimes involve separate victims or involve the same victim on separate occasions as defined in 667.61, subd. (i).) crimes against a single victim were committed on separate occasions under this subdivision, the court shall consider whether, between the commission of one sex crime and another, the defendant had a reasonable opportunity to reflect upon his or her actions and nevertheless resumed sexually assaultive behavior. neither the duration of time between crimes, nor whether or not the defendant lost or abandoned his or her opportunity to attack, shall be, in and of itself, determinative of the issue of whether the 667.6, subd. (d), emphasis added.) the parties agree on this much. however, they disagree on whether the offenses in this case were committed on separate occasionsand therefore, whether defendant was properly sentenced to consecutive, rather than concurrent, indeterminate terms. 3.2 separate occasions 20 sevidence. (people v. groves (2003) 107 cal.app.4th 1227, 12311232.) accordingly, o]nce a trial judge has found under section 667.6, subdivision (d), that a defendant committed offenses on separate occasions, we may reverse only if no reasonable trier of fact could have decided the defendant had a reasonable opportunity for reflection after (people v. garza (2003) 107 cal.app.4th 1081, 1092 (garza).) there is no bright line rule for evaluating whether violent sex crimes occurred on separate occasion forcible violent sexual assault made up of varied types of sex acts committed over time a (people v. irvin (1996) 43 cal.app.4th 1063, 1071.) thus, a finding that the defendant obvious break in the perpetrator (people v. jones (2001) 25 cal.4th 98, 104 (jones), superseded by statute on other grounds as stated in rodriguez, supra, 207 cal.app.4th at p. 213.) a reasonable opportunity to reflect upon his or her actions and nevertheless resumed 667.6, subd. (d); see jones, at pp. 103106.) thus, in garza, the appellate court affirmed the finding of separate occasions where, between acts of forcible oral copulation and rape, the defendant released the victims neck, ordered her to strip, punched her in the eye, put his gun to her head, threatened to shoot her, and removed his own clothes. (garza, supra, 107 cal.app.4th at p. 1092.) the court also concluded the defendant had an adequate opportunity to reflect upon his actions when, between acts of digital penetration and rape, the defendant played with the victims chest, put his gun down, pulled the victims legs around his shoulders, and began forcible intercourse with her. (id. at pp. 10921093.) although the sex acts occurred in one place and without much of a break between acts, (id. at p. 1092.) 21 similarly, in people v. king, our colleagues in division one addressed a case concerning a police officer who sexually assaulted a victim during a purported traffic stop. (people v. king (2010) 183 cal.app.4th 1281, 12861287.) though the attacks took no more than two minutes (id. at p. 1324), the evidence supported the separate-occasion finding. after a first act of digital penetration, the defendant saw lights and a car driving past, at which point he paused, looked around uneasily, then used his other hand to digitally penetrate the victim again. (id. at pp. 12871291.) this evidence was sufficient for a reasonable trier of fact to conclude the defendant had a reasonable opportunity to reflect before resuming his assaultive behavior. (id. at pp. 13251326.) relying on people v. corona and people v. pena, defendant argues there is insufficient evidence to support such a finding in this case because the varied attacks (see people v. corona (1988) 206 cal.app.3d 13 (corona); people v. pena (1992) 7 cal.app.4th 1294 (pena).) as a preliminary matter, the california supreme court has criticized corona and pena, both of which involved earlier versions of section 667.6. (jones, supra, 25 cal.4th at pp. 104105, 114.) in any event, we find those cases unpersuasive. in corona, the prosecutor took the position oral copulation and foreign object rape, occurring just prior to the rapes, are themselves corona, supra, at p. 16.) apparently accepting that concession, the corona court d). argument on that issue, the corona court had no occasion to consider just how much opportunity for reflection was required. pena, in turn, relies heavily on corona. (pena, supra, 7 cal.app.4th at p. 1314.) but since corona did not have occasion to resolve the central issue before us, that reliance appears to be unwarranted. here, there is no concession from the prosecutor. and unlike corona and pena, which were decided more than 20 years ago, we havjones and the subsequent appellate opinions that have applied it. 22 3.3 we agree with the people, and with the court below, that defendant reasonable opportunity to reflect upon his actions, chose not to b. as the court explained in detail, after dragging b. to the bathroom by her hair, defendant pressed her against the wall and inserted his fingers into her vagina. after completing that act, defendant punched b. in the face, then unzipped his pants, removed his penis, and raped her. next, defendant removed his penis from b.seized a nearby toilet plunger, and inserted it into b.discarded the plunger and raped b. again. when he was done, defendant removed his penis from b.vagina and ejaculated into the toilet. unlike in pena, defendant did not accomplish these acts in a matter of seconds (see pena, supra, 7 cal.app.4th at p. 1316); instead, the ordeal lasted approximately 13 minutes. the court conducted a lengthy, detailed examination of these facts, and came to the following conclusions. [defendant] did. there was nothing seamless in terms of this sort of rolling from one action to another.as reflected in the audio and video recordings, d by continuous screams. it was punctuated by [b.and screaming no, attempting to negotiate with him, and his responses were threats and nd not to ignore her, but simply telling herthreatening her even more. he reaction from the defendant, a reassessment of what he was doing or about to do, and he took appropriate actions that he thought necessary to carry out each of his crimes. pinned close to g23 bathrooms, you know, to unclog a toilet. he must have looked at it asthe handle as it ounds like an the court continued, i believe the use of the plunger itself and how it was used shows and a reflective aspect in terms of as an object that you can use for something other than its intended purpose, but an opportunity to further penetrate the two orifices of the victim, which are her anus and her vagina. the court reasonedwhich he did and with the objects in which he did and the body parts in which he did, in again noting the substantial length of the attacksnature of the crimes and the sequence of events, the court finds a single circumstance with not only an actual opportunity to reflect upon, but the court believes that he, in fact, engaged in reflection in terms of what the next act was going to be and that, over the we agree. 4. fines and penalty assessments people v. cattaneo (1990) 217 cal.app.3d 1577, for the first time on appeal, and is subject to judicial correction whenever the error comes to the attention of the reviewing court. (people v. dotson (1997) 16 cal.4th 547, 554, fn. 6.) 4.1 sex offender fine effective september 20, 2006, section 290.3, subdivision (a) provides for sex- 2610.) because defendant was convicted of four counts subject to this fine, he had one qualifying first conviction and three qualifying second and subsequent convictions. ( (2004) 24 122 cal.app.4th 817, 822; see people v. walz (2008) 160 cal.app.4th 1364, 1371 (walz).) therefore, defendant was eligible for one $300 fine for count 1, and up to three fines of $500 each for counts 2, 3, and 5. (ibid.) put another way, the court could have imposed fines totaling $300, $800, $1300 or $1800. (walz, supra, 160 cal.app.4th at pp. 13691371 [must impose fine in statutory amount or not at all].) the court in this case imposed a $500 fine on count 1an amount unauthorized by statute. we therefore reduce the count 1 fine to $300, an amount authorized by statute. (people v. valenzuela (2009) 172 cal.app.4th 1246, 12491250.) t, 3, and 5 is not jurisdictional error. (walz, supra, 160 cal.app.4th at p. 1371.) the people did not object to the failure to impose the fines, and on this silent record, we presume the court determined defendant did not have the ability to pay the additional fines. (people v. tillman (2000) 22 cal.4th 300, 301302 [peoples failure to object forfeits assertion that trial court erred in making discretionary choice not to impose fines]; people v. stewart (2004) 117 cal.app.4th 907, 911 [on silent record, failure to impose sex offender fine implies finding that defendant does not have the ability to pay].) 4.2 penalty assessments the sex offender fine is subject to seven additional assessments, penalties, and a surchargecollectively called penalty assessments. (people v. sharret (2011) 191 cal.app.4th 859, 864 (sharretorally impose [these] penalties and surcharge . . . ibid.) while the sharret court approved this practice, it cautioned that ibid.) that is, the abstract of judgment must separately list people v. hamed (2013) 221 cal.app.4th 928, 940.) the abstract of judgment in this case is insufficient; it simply says, efendant ordered to pay $2,050 pursuant to 290.3 does not mention penalty assessments at all. the minute order is not much clearer. it 25 pursuant to penal code section 290.3, said fine is to include a surcharge of $100.00 and the judgment here must be modified because the court imposed a fine in an amount unauthorized by section 290.3 and failed to specify how it arrived at the $1,450 remand this matter to the sentencing court to orally pronounce the correct judgment. we will therefore direct the trial court clerk to prepare an amended abstract of people v. hamed, supra, 221 cal.app.4th at p. 940.) [t]he trial court is to actively and personally insure the clerk accurately prepares a correct amended abstract of judgment. people v. johnson (2015) 234 cal.app.4th 1432, 1459.) 4.3 amount of base fine and penalty assessments as discussed, the correct amount of the section 290.3 base fine was $300 for a first offense. this $300 base fine was subject to the following penalty assessments: (1) a 100 percent state penalty assessment ( 1464, subd. (a)(1)) equal to $300; (2) a 20 percent state criminal surcharge ( 1465.7) equal to $60; (3) a 50 percent county assessment (gov. code,  76000, subds. (a)(1), (e)) equal to $150; (4) a 30 percent court construction penalty (gov. code,  70372) equal to $90 (see people v. mccoy (2007) 156 cal.app.4th 1246, 1249 [penalty in los angeles is $3 for every $10 or part of $10]); (5) a 20 percent emergency medical services penalty (gov. code,  76000.5) equal to $60; (6) a 10 percent dna penalty (gov. code,  76104.6, subd. (a)(1)) equal to $30; and (7) a 40 percent state-only dna penalty (gov. code,  76104.7) equal to $120. thus, the correct amount of the penalty assessments is $810. disposition the judgment is modified to reduce the sex offender fine (pen. code,  290.3) to $300. in addition, defendant is ordered to pay the following penalty assessments: (1) a $300 state penalty assessment (pen. code,  1464, subd. (a)(1)); (2) a $60 state 26 criminal surcharge (pen. code,  1465.7); (3) a $150 county assessment (gov. code,  76000, subd. (a)(1)); (4) a $90 court construction penalty (gov. code,  70372); (5) a $60 emergency medical services penalty (gov. code,  76000.5); (6) a $30 dna penalty (gov. code,  76104.6, subd. (a)(1)); and (7) a $120 state-only dna penalty (gov. code,  76104.7). the total amount of penalty assessments on the sex offender fine is $810. in all other respects, the judgment is affirmed as modified. the clerk of the trial court is directed to prepare an amended abstract of judgment indicating the amount of and statutory basis for the sex offender fine and the amount of and statutory basis for each penalty assessment and surcharge set forth above, and to send a copy of the amended abstract to the department of corrections and rehabilitation. not to be published in the official reports lavin, j. we concur: edmon, p. j. aldrich, j.
