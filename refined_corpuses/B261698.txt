filed 10/27/16 p. v. carpio ca2/2 not to be published in the official reports california rules of court, rule 8.1115(a), prohibits courts and parties from citing or relying on opinions not certified for publication or ordered published, except as specified by rule 8.1115(b). this opinion has not been certified for publication or ordered published for purposes of rule 8.1115. in the court of appeal of the state of california second appellate district division two the people, plaintiff and respondent, v. anthony carpio et al., defendants and appellants. b261698 (los angeles county super. ct. no. la073936) appeal from a judgment of the superior court of los angeles county. martin l. herscovitz, judge. affirmed. allen g. weinberg, under appointment by the court of appeal, for defendant and appellant anthony carpio. tanya dellaca, under appointment by the court of appeal, for defendant and appellant michael carpio. kamala d. harris, attorney general, gerald a. engler, chief assistant attorney general, lance e. winters, senior assistant attorney general, scott a. taryle, supervising deputy attorney general, and russell a. lehman and nicholas webster, deputy attorneys general, for plaintiff and respondent. * * * * * * 2 brothers anthony (anthony) and michael (michael) carpio issued a gang challenge to a person standing on a high school campus handball court, which turned into a three-way fistfight, and ended when anthony stabbed the person 10 times with a knife.1 the victim thereafter died. a jury convicted the brothers of second degree murder (pen. code,  187, subd. (a)),2 found that the murder was committed for the benefit of a street gang ( 186.22, subd. (b)), and found that anthony personally used a deadly and dangerous weapon ( 12022, subd. (b)(1)). on appeal, both brothers argue that (1) the testimony of the peolause, and (2) the trial court erred in not instructing the jury on the crime of involuntary manslaughter as a lesser included offense to murder and in giving caljic no. 5.31. michael additionally argues that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction, as an aider and abettor, of second degree murder. we reject all of these claims, and affirm. facts and procedural background i. facts one afternoon after school, anthony and michael walked onto the campus of the cleveland high school in reseda, california. (orellana), who was standing on one of the handball courts. that is a common gang challenge, and michael admitted he was . orellana said something that led michael to believe that orellana was associated with a rival street gang. michael threw a punch, and anthony soon joined in the three-way fistfight. orellana fought back, taking on both brothers for a time and, as he gained the upper hand, concentrating first on one brother and then the other. at some point when orellana was fighting michael and his back was to anthony, anthony pulled a knife and stabbed orellana 10 times in the head, neck, and left and right torso. as the brothers fled, anthony dropped the knife. michael picked it up, cleaned it off, and 1 because both brothers share the same last name, we will use first names. we mean no disrespect. 2 all further statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise indicated. 3 then tossed it away before the brothers got into a waiting minivan and drove off. ii. procedural history the people charged both brothers with first degree murder ( 187, subd. (a)), and further alleged that (1) the murder was committed for the benefit of, at the direction of, and in association with a criminal street gang ( 186.22, subd. (b)(4)), and (2) anthony personally used a deadly and dangerous weapon ( 12022, subd. (b)(1)). the trial court instructed the jury on several lesser included offenses to first degree murdernamely, second degree murder, voluntary manslaughter based on heat-of-passion, and voluntary manslaughter based on imperfect self-defense. the court also instructed the jury on self-defense. the jury convicted each brother of second degree murder, and found the gang and weapon-use enhancements to be true. the trial court sentenced anthony to state prison for 16 years to life, comprised of 15 years to life for the second degree murder plus an additional year for the weapon-use enhancement. the court sentenced michael to state prison for 15 years to life. the brothers filed timely appeals. discussion i. evidentiary issues both brothers argue that thviolated their sixth amendment right to confront and cross-examine witnesses as defined in crawford v. washington (2004) 541 u.s. 36 (crawford) and people v. sanchez (2016) 63 cal.4th 665 (sanchez). we review de novo the application of the confrontation clause. (people v. giron-chamul (2016) 245 cal.app.4th 932, 964.) a. pertinent facts in its case-in-chief, the people called a gang expert regarding gang culture generally and the rockwood criminal street gang specifically. the expert was assigned to the gang enforcement unit of the los angeles police department, and had been assigned specifically to the rockwood gang for two years. 4 with respect to gang culture generally, the expert testified that gang members will and if the answer reflects that the person is from another gang, the instigator will often, although not always, these challenges and the resort to violence, the expert explained, and are designed to make community members and rival gang members fear and respect the gang. with respect to the rockwood gang specifically, the expert testified that the gang has approximately 200 members; that it controls an area just west of downtown los angeles; and that its members are ear items from sports teams that prominently h translationpiedra madera). he testified that bbery, assault with a deadly weapon, weapons charges, narcotics charges, attempted murder and murder. the prosecution introduced certified court records as to two of those predicate offenses and the expert further testified to the commission of such crimes by two known rockwood gang members: richard alvarez (alvarez) was convicted of a 2007 murder and rodrigo bernal (bernal) was convicted of a 2008 murder. with respect to the crime charged in this case, the expert opined that michael and anthony were both members of the rockwood gang. he concluded michael was a rockwood gang member because (1) police had in the past spoken with michael, he had told them he was a rockwood gang member, and police had memorialized that conversation in a field identification ; (2) michael told police during a post-arrest interview in this case that on his body; and (4) a notebook seized from both brothers when they were arrested s of rival gangs crossed out. the expert concluded that anthony was a rockwood gang member based on a prior admission memorialized in a f.i. card and based on the notebook seized from the brothers. after 5 the prosecutor presented a hypothetical matching the facts of this case, the expert opined a benefitted and was in association with the rockwood street gang. b. governing law until recently, an expert could testify about any out-of-court statements that formed the basis for his opinion without having to satisfy either the hearsay rule or the confrontation clause, even if the statements would have otherwise been inadmissible under the hearsay rule. (e.g., people v. gardeley (1996) 14 cal.4th 605, 618-620.) these earlier cases rested on the notion that the out-of-court statements were not being admitted for their truth, but instead for their effect on the hearer (namely, the expert). (people v. montiel only to the basis of his opinion and should not be considered for their truth however, recent decision in sanchez overruled this earlier precedent and reinstituted a distinction the (sanchez, supra, 63 cal.4th at p. 678.) sanchez rejected as fiction the notion that the out-of-court statements an expert relies upon as the basis for his or her opinion are not admitted for sanchez court id. at pp. 684, 686.) the sanchez court was nevertheless careful to explain the limits of this new approach to evaluating expert testimony. sanchez adhered to earlier law insofar as (1) an rely on hearsay in forming an opinion, and may tell the jury in general terms id. inion may . . . whether or not admissible, that is of a type that reasonably may be relied upon by an expert in forming an opinion, italics added); and (2) an expert may still tell the jury the specific basis for his or her opinion if it . . . training and experience, even though that information may have been derived from conversations with others, lectures, study of sanchez, at pp. 675-676), or (bid. at p. 685). sanchez testify to the basis of his 6 or her opinion when it comes from -specific -of-court statementsof unless the people satisfy the requirements of both the hearsay rule and the confrontation clause. (id. at pp. 676, 684, 686.) c. analysis sanchez because the expert testified (1) that the f.i. cards the basis for his opinion that each brother belonged to the rockwood street gang, and f.i. -specific, out-of- knowledge; (2) about gang culture and the escalation of confrontations between rival gang members; and (3) about the gang membership of the two other rockwood gang members who committed murders in 2007 and 2008, because the expert had no personal knowledge of their gang affiliation. michael adecision in united states v. mejia (2d cir. 2008) 545 f.3d 179 (mejia) prohibits an expert from providing testimony about gang culture in general or opining on what case-specific facts mean when that testimony is likely derived from out-of-court conversations with others. the brotlast two arguments and mejia-based argument are without merit. sanchez ability to explain the basis for his or her opinion when that basis is the generalized knowledge in his or her area of expertise; any other rule, the sanchez court noted, would be impractical. (sanchez, supra, 63 cal.4th at pp. 675-argument lacks merit because sanchez-those relating to the particular events and participants alleged to have been involved in the case being triedid. at p. 676, italics added) means that facts regarding the gang affiliation of alvarez and bernalneither of whom were involved in the brothebeing tried-sanchezs redrawn line that does not require compliance with the confrontation clause or the hearsay rule. 7 mejia-based argument lacks merit because sanchez charted a different path than mejia when sanchez [case-id. at p. 676.) however, the brothers are correct that the people may have violated sanchez when membership. t-specific, out-of-s of which he had no personal knowledge. we must therefore assess whether the people established a relevant hearsay exception and whether those statements are non-meaning of crawfordwhether the error was harmless. (people v. trujeque (2015) 61 cal.4th 227, 275 [crawford error assessed to see whether it is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt]; people v. seumanu (2015) 61 cal.4th 1293, 1308 [error under hearsay rule assessed to see whether there is a reasonable probability of a different result].) sanchez noted that f.i. cards can be meaning of crawford if they are created for use in future prosecutions and not for use in (sanchez, supra, 63 cal.4th at p. 697.) we need not delve into the purpose for which the f.i. cards regarding the brothers were created in this case because, even if they were created for use in future prosecutions and even if their admission thereby violated the confrontation clause, the doubt because there was overwhelming evidence aside from the f.i. cards that murder in this case was in association with or benefitted the rockwood street gang. aside by his admission of gang membership during his post-arrest interview, by the multiple rockwood-affiliated tattoos on his body, by the pittsburgh steelers hat he wore when he confronted orellana and by the notebook with gang-related writing seized from his street gang is weaker, he need not be a gang member to commit a crime in association with or to benefit a street gang. (people v. bragg (2008) 161 cal.app.4th 1385, 1402.) 8 here, the gang enhancement overwhelmingly applies to anthony because he committed the murder with a rockwood gang membermichael. ii. sufficiency of the evidence michael challenges the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his second degree murder conviction. the jury was instructed it could find michael liable for orellanadeath on two theories: (1) michael aided and abetted antsecond degree murder; or (2) michael aided and abetted the battery of orellana, and second degree murder was a natural and probable consequence of that battery. michael challenges the evidence supporting both theories. in evaluating a claim challenging the sufficiency of the evidence, our role is limited. we review the whole record in the light most favorable to the judgment to determine whether it contains substantial evidencei.e., evidence that is credible and of solid valuefrom which a rational trier of fact could have found the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.people v. nguyen (2015) 61 cal.4th 1015, 1054-1055 (nguyen).) a. to support a finding that michael aided and abetted a second degree murder lawful killing of a human being . . . ( 187, subd. (a).) there are two degrees of murder, first degree and second degree. ( 189.) what distinguishes them is that first degree murder involves aggravating circumstances over and above proof of an unlawful, malicious killing, such as proof that the homicide was committed willfully, deliberately and with premeditation. ( 189; people v. cravens (2012) 53 cal.4th 500, 507 (cravens).) all murders, regardless of degree, require , and malice may when there is manifested a deliberate intention unlawfully to take away the life of a act, the natural and probable consequences of which are dangerous to human life, people v. elmore (2014) 59 cal.4th 121, 133 (elmore);  188). 9 a person is liable for a crime if he commits the crime himself or if he aids and abets another in its commission. ( 31.) a person is liable as an aider and abettor if (1) s unlawful purpose, (2) he, by his act or advice, , and (3) he acts with the intent or purpose to commit, encourage or facilitate the actual people v. mccoy (2001) 25 cal.4th 1111, 1118; people v. prettyman (1996) 14 cal.4th 248, 259 (prettyman); people v. beeman (1984) 35 cal.3d 547, 561.) when a person is directly aiding and abetting a crime, he must have the same intent as the actual perpetrator. (mccoy, at p. 1118 & fn. 1; nguyen, supra, 61 cal.4th at p. 1054.) there is sufficient evidence upon which a rational jury could conclude that michael aided and abetted anthony in committing the second degree murder of orellana. michael admitted in his post-arrest interview that he did not allow anthony to carry a reness that anthony sometimes carried a knife. both michael and anthony arrived at the high school campus together. anthony stood by while michael confronted orellana, and jumped into the fight when michael looked to be losing. michael nevertheless jumped back into the fight, distracting orellana while anthony came around behind him and stabbed him. immediately after the attack and as they fled, michael picked up the knife anthony had used, wiped it down, and again discarded it. looking at the totality of this evidence (people v. quiroz (2013) 215 cal.app.4th 65, 76-77 [jury may look to conduct before, during and after a charged offense in assessing the intent of an aider and abettor]), a jury could rationally infer that michael and anthony had a plan to fight and, if necessary, to stab orellana; that michael knew of this plan and intended to further it; and that michael jumped back into the fight and wiped down the knife in furtherance of that plan. michael raises two arguments in response. first, he asserts that there was no direct evidence that he knew anthony had a knife. he points to the fact that he denied knowing about the knife during his post-arrest interview. but the jury also knew that michael was lying to the police when he denied knowing about the knife because they 10 heard a recording of the conversation that michael and anthony had immediately after hopping into the minivan, in which michael explained how he had wiped down the knife. (the conversation was recorded because one of them accihis cell the jury could more, michael certainly knew that the brothers intended to pick a fistfight, and the punches thrown in a fistfight can also support a finding of implied malice. (e.g., cravens, supra, 53 cal.4th at p. 511.) second, michael points to the evidence that he accidentally recorded conversation in the minivan. however, the jury heard this evidence and did not find that it outweighed the other evidence indicating a coordinated plan. in reviewing the substantiality of evidence, we are not permitted to reweigh the evidence people v. prunty (2015) 62 cal.4th 59, 89.) b. to support a finding that michael aided and abetted a battery, and that second degree murder is a natural and probable consequence of a battery an aider and abettor is not only guilty of the crime he intends to aid and abet, but he perpetrator actually commits . . . that is a natural and probable people v. rangel (2016) 62 cal.4th 1192, 1228-1229; prettyman, supra, 14 cal.4th at p. 254.) before criminal liability will attach for a further crime beyond the intended crime, the people must prove (1) that the defendant aided and abetted the intended crime, and natural and probable consequence (prettyman, at pp. 261-262; cf. rosemond v. united states (2014) 134 s.ct. 1240, 1248 element, courts ask: would recognize that the further crime was a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the crime the defendant intended to aid and abet? (people v. chiu (2014) 59 cal.4th 155, 165; people v. medina (2009) 46 cal.4th 913, 920 (medina); people v. gonzalez (2001) 87 11 cal.app.4th 1, 9-10; people v. woods (1992) 8 cal.app.4th 1570, 1587.) for these purposes, it is enough reasonably have been contemplated (medina, at p. 920.) indeed, the further crime ibid.) under these standards, it does not actually (ibid.; gonzalez, at p. 9.) courts have held that a reasonable person would foresee that murder is a natural and probable consequence of an assault with a deadly weapon. (prettyman, supra, 14 cal.3th at p. 262.) along the same lines, courts have held that a reasonable person would foresee that murder is a natural and probable consequence of a gang-related assault or fistfight. (e.g., medina, supra, 46 cal.4th at p. 922 [so holding]; people v. olguin (1994) 31 cal.app.4th 1355, 1376 [same]; people v. godinez (1992) 2 cal.app.4th 492, 499-500 [same]; people v. montano (1979) 96 cal.app.3d 221, 226-227 [same]; see generally people v. ayala (2010) 181 cal.app.4th 1440, 1449-1450 [gathering cases].) because there was sufficient evidence that michael aided and abetted the gang-related confrontation and subsequent battery of orellana (indeed, he did the confronting and started the fight), and in light of the weight of authority holding that murder is a natural and probable consequence of such acts, there was sufficient evidsecond degree murder conviction on this theory as well. michael raises four objections to this logic. first, he argues that there was no evidence that he knew anthony was carrying a knife in advance. this argument fails factually because, as explained above, there was evidence from which the jury could infer that michael did know anthony was carrying a knife. this argument also fails legally because our supreme court held in medina n the gang context, it was not necessary for there to have been a prior discussion of or agreement to a shooting, or for a gang member to have known a fellow gang member was in fact armedmedina, supra, 46 cal.4th at p. 924; see also people v. montes (1999) 74 cal.app.4th 1050, 1056 (montes) [so holding]; but see people v. butts (1965) 236 cal.app.2d 817, 836-837 [holding that use of a weapon is not a natural and probable consequence of a random bar 12 brawl].) second, michael asserts that gang confrontations do not always end up in murders, aing testified. we reject this assertion because the pertinent test is reasonable foreseeability, not inevitability. michael predicts that this logic will mean that murder will be viewed as a natural and probable consequence of every gang confrontation. however, our concern is with the particulars of the gang confrontation presented in this case, and orellanastabbing was a natural and probable consequence of that confrontation. gang evidence standing alone cannot prove a defendant is an aider and abettor to a crime.nguyen, supra, 61 cal.4th at p. agang membership alone; it rests on his knowledge that anthony sometimes carried a a and his subsequent fistfdistraction of orellana wiping the knife clean. lastly, michael asserts that murder cannot be a natural and probable consequence of a mere misdemeanor like battery. for support, he cites people v. munn (1884) 65 cal. 211, 213, people v. spring (1984) 153 cal.app.3d 1199, 1205, and people v. huynh (2002) 99 cal.app.4th 662, 679. munn and spring although huynh suggests a misdemeanor is insufficient, more recent cases have refused to give dispositive weight to whether the intended crime is labeled a felony or misdemeanor as long as the further crime is a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the intended crime. (see people v. canizalez (2011) 197 cal.app.4th 832, 853-854; see also montes, supra, 74 cal.app.4th at pp. 1054-1055 [upholding murder conviction in gang context where intended crimes were assault and breach of the peace].) we agree with these more recent cases. iii. instructional errors the brothers contend that the trial court committed two instructional errors: (1) it did not instruct the jury on the crime of involuntary manslaughter as a lesser included 13 offense to murder, and (2) it read caljic no. 5.31, which misled the jury into believing that imperfect self-defense was unavailable if either brother escalated the fistfight into a instructions. (people v. jimenez (2016) 246 cal.app.4th 726, 731.) a. involuntary manslaughter instruction as part of its duty to instruct the jury on generally applicable principles of law, a trial court may be required on its own to instruct the jury not only on the charged offenses, but also any lesser offenses that are necessarily included in each charged offense. (people v. breverman (1998) 19 cal.4th 142, 154-155 (breverman).) involuntary manslaughter is a lesser included offense of murder. (people v. thomas (2012) 53 cal.4th 771, 813.) murder, as noted above, is defined as the lawful killing of a human being . . . also as noted above, mais manifand probable consequences of which are dangerous to human life, performed with conelmore, supra, 59 cal.4th at p. 133;  188). by contrast, ( 192, sub. (b)); (2) a misdemeanor (ibid.); (3) a noninherently dangerous felony (people v. burroughs (1984) 35 cal.3d 824, 835, overruled in part on other grounds by people v. blakeley (2000) 23 cal.4th 82); or (4) an inherently dangerous assaultive felony (people v. brothers (2015) 236 cal.app.4th 24, 33-34 (brothers)unintentional conduct which is gross or reckless, amounting to disregard of human life or an indifference to the people v. guillen (2014) 227 cal.app.4th 934, 1027, citing people v. penny (1955) 44 cal.2d 861, 879.) uty to instruct on lesser included offenses is triggered only a rational jury could conclude that the 14 defendant committed the lesser offense, and that he is not guilty of the greater offense. people v. whalen (2013) 56 cal.4th 1, 68, quoting people v. depriest ub . . . any evidence . . . composed of reasonable [persons] could . . . cthe greater, was committepeople v. cruz (2008) 44 cal.4th 636, 664.) in assessing the substantiality of the evidence for these purposes, we view it in the light most favorable to the defendant. (people v. millbrook (2014) 222 cal.app.4th 1122, 1137.) applying these standards, whether the trial court was required to instruct the jury on involuntary manslaughter in this case comes down to whether there was substantial evidence that the killing of orellana was the product of criminal negligence (and thus the lesser offense of involuntary manslaughter), but not there was no such evidence. ahis own conduct in stabbing orellana 10 times with a knife; the sheer number of wounds and their infliction in parts of orellana, neck and head) overwhelmingly refute the notion that anthony somehow orellana. because there iconduct was the product of criminal negligence, no involuntary manslaughter instruction was warranted. (e.g., people v. cook (2006) 39 cal.4th 566, 596-597 (cook) [defendant not entitled to involuntary manslaughter instruction brothers, supra, 236 cal.app.4th at pp. 27-28, 34-35 [defendant not entitled to involuntary manslaughter instruction after she repeatedly beat her victim with a broomstick, burned him with cigarettes, and shoved a cloth gag down his throat].) because michael did not stab orellana, his liability for the orellanadeath was second degree murder, or (2) aided and abetted a battery (the fistfight between rival gang members), the natural and probable consequence of which was the second degree murder. 15 in either case, michael was not entitled to an involuntary manslaughter instruction because the second degree murder itself was not a product of criminal negligence. michael raises three further arguments in response. first, he seems to suggest that we must focus on his conduct and ask whether he acted with malice or negligently when he engaged in fistfight that led to the homicide. he is wrong. the involuntary manslaughter instruction pertains to the homicide, so we must focus on whether the homicide itselfnot any act leading up to the homicidewas the product of criminal negligence or malice. (e.g., cook, supra, 39 cal.4th at pp. 596-597; brothers, supra, 236 cal.app.4th at pp. 27-28, 34-35.) second, michael asserts that a stabbing is not the inevitable result of a fistfight. but whether the stabbing was inevitable (or even foreseeable) is irrelevant to whether it was committed negligently or with malice. if the jury decided that the stabbing was not reasonably foreseeable, its job was to acquit michael of being an aider and abettor to the homicidenot return a verdict on the inapplicable, lesser included offense of involuntary manslaughter. lastly, michael asks us to ignore and/or reconsider our suprebreverman that a trial included offenses is not an error of federal dimension. (breverman, supra, 19 cal.4th at pp. 165-166.) because we conclude there was no error, we have no occasion to reach the merits of this argument. b. caljic no. 5.31 instruction 1. pertinent facts the trial court instructed the jury on the crimes of first degree murder, second degree murder, and voluntary manslaughter (both due to provocation and due to imperfect self-defense). the court also gave several self-defense instructions, including calcrim no. 505 defining self-defense, calcrim no. 3471 specifying when the defense is available to the initial aggressor or in cases of mutual combat, and caljic no. 5.31. caljic no. person being assaulted in using a deadly weapon in self-defense or defense of another unless that person believes and a reasonable person in the same or similar circumstances 16 would believe that the assault is likely to inflict great bodily injury upon him or someone 2. analysis no. 5.31 was reversible error for two reasons. first, they argue that courts are not supposed to mix calcrim and caljic instructions and that doing so is reversible error. they are wrong. although the council of cal. crim. jury instns. (2007-2008), guide for using, p. xxvi), and now [s]judicial council of cal. crim. jury instns. (fall 2015 ed.), guide for using, p. xxii), the usage guides do not relieve us of the burden to assess whether the instructions as given and as a whole constitute error, which we turn to next. second, the brothers assert that dropping caljic no. 5.31 into the predominantly calcrim-based instructions on perfect self-defense misled the jury into believing that it could not apply the doctrine of imperfect self-defeno. that the jury misunderstood and misapplied the instrinstructions as a whole. (people v. smithey (1999) 20 cal.4th 936, 963-964.) it is not reasonably likely that the jury read caljic no. 5.31 to preclude its consideration of voluntary manslaughter on the ground of imperfect self-defense. caljic no. 5.31 by its terms addresses how to assess whether a defendant acted in perfect self-defense (not imperfect self-defense) (people v. wittig (1984) 158 cal.app.3d 124, 137), and is a correct statement of the law in that regard (people v. rush (1960) 180 cal.app.2d 885, 889-890). what is more, the trial court gave caljic no. 5.31 in the cluster of instructions regarding perfect self-defense (and before making any mention of imperfect self-defense), and caljic no. 5.31 reasonable person in the same or similar circumstances the elements of perfect self-defense set forth in calcrim no. 505. although we agree 17 --defense, in light of the timing and content of caljic no. 5.31, the closing arguments of counsel that assumed that imperfect self-defense remained available, and the absence of any jury note expressing any confusion on this point, it is not reasonably likely that the jury read caljic no. 5.31 in the manner the brothers have further contention that caljic no. 5.31 amounts unnecessary . . . pinpoint instruction that highlights facts favorable to the people because the instruction is balanced and focuses the jury in an unbiased manner on how to evaluate the elements of perfect self-defense in the context of an escalating fight. disposition the judgments of anthony and michael are affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. ______________________, j. hoffstadt we concur: _________________________, p. j. boren _________________________, j. chavez
