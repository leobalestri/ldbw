(a)) (count 40) and 26 counts of violating a protective order between april 29, 2014 and august 17, 2015 ( 166, subd. (c)(1)) (counts 2-27). it specially alleged talley had suffered a prior serious or violent felony conviction within the meaning of the three strikes law ( 667, subds. (b)-(h); 1170.12) 1 statutory references are to this code unless otherwise stated. 3 and a prior serious felony conviction within the meaning of section 667, subdivision (a). talley pleaded not guilty and denied the special allegations. 2. the evidence at trial linda wilson and her housemate, jamie kuhn, were the only witnesses to testify at trial. wilson testified she and talley began dating in 2010 and they had lived together in her home for a time. the relationship was tumultuous; talley was violent. wilson and kuhn both testified talley frequently threatened to kill wilson. the people introduced evidence of several s prior acts of violence: on december 13, 2013 talley struck wilson in the head with a digital tablet. on february 13, 2014 talley punched wilson in the eye and attempted to run her over with his car. on march 14, 2014 talley pointed a handgun at wilson and pulled the trigger. wilson and kuhn heard a clicking sound, but the gun did not fire. on march she refused his demand to drive him to work. on march 19, 2014 talley physically attacked wilson and told her, wilson reported each of these incidents to the police. the court ruled the uncharged misconduct was admissible to was not unduly prejudicial. talley was arrested in april 2014.2 on april 29, 2014, while talley was in custody, wilson obtained a criminal protective order prohibiting talley from having any personal, electronic or written contact with her. (l.a.s.c. case no. ma062623.) despite the protective order, talley continued to 2 4 contact wilson while he was incarcerated. estimation talley called her on the telephone more than 300 times and sent her more than 500 letters. wilson did not respond to calls or letters. talley also wrote letters to wilson business colleague, her personal physician and to kuhn, each of whom forwarded the letters to wilson. some of letters to wilson were more than 20 pages long. wilson gave some of the letters to law enforcement; retained some, in whole or in part; and discarded the rest. she explained it had become too overwhelming for her to retain all of them. in 2015 wilson moved from her large home in acton, where she had owned a dog breeding business for several years, to a small apartment in another city so that talley could not find her. however, talley managed to discover her new address and mailed at least one letter to her there. a number of to wilson, written and received after wilson had obtained the protective order, were introduced into evidence. in some of the letters talley declared his love for wilson and apologized to her. in others he was menacing and told her she could never escape from him. for example, in one letter he wrote, [n]othing on this earth will keep us apart and warned her that, wherever she went, he would be able to find her. in another he asked about his motorcycle and his watch, which were , and wrote, your actions out there whiey also wroteget someone fucked up and that you and my bike and even 5 though my friendsmy finger [i]s messed up i still can fight in one written communication talley simply sent wilson a preprinted form for a statutory will and trust, which wilson interpreted as a signal from talley that he intended to kill her and take her house and her dogs. in another, talley sent wilson an alcoholics anonymous study guide that included a paragraph equating a recovering alcoholic to a gunshot victim. the words in the study guide stated, in the version talley sent to wilson, the printed line was underlined several times in ink; and the as added by interlineation to , so that the edited line read, in yet another letter talley warned wilson, rolexlike i told your friend will[,] graces. i advise you not to fuck that up. considering i have this out with you. so now here is your chance to set the matter straight and avoid future problems. fight and beat up some [word redacted by court].he subsequently wrote, you think due to people sentenced to 50 percent now get[] to do 33 percent of their time, so that puts me out in under a year. if you did something to my bike please tell me so we can work it out as adults. i will be out before the lease[] is up on the ranch. . . . to know that if anything happens to my rolex or harley which are the only things i have left in this world, i will completely on the back of that letter 6 social security number. in a february 2015 letter to wilson, admitted at trial as exhibit 55 and identified by the prosecutor as the basis for the charge of making a criminal threat, heads up for saving grace. my harley[3] needs to be found and returned to me to make me forget about taking action. i just sent out notification regarding a heavy reward for the issue to be dealt with by any means necessary. you are not my friend, family or someone i gave a shit about. my daughter received a copy of your letter as proof of what a piece of shit you are. for future be putting a restraining order against you. . . . i drop [sic] the lawsuit except the $2,400 owed to me for the deposit i put on ranch.[4] take my bike without repercussions youre fucking crazyhome soon so enjoy living at my house and breeding my dogstrust me when i say all good things must come to an end. as than a whore that is going to end up pushing a shopping cart in downtown l.a. due to all the people you hurt. who is going to watch the dogs when linda gets pulled over with drugs in her 3 , to be found and returned to me,this appears to be a transcription error. exhibit 55, which wilson read to the jury 4 wilson testified talley had filed a frivolous lawsuit while in prison to obtain ownership of her property and her dogs. 7 without waking up screaming every hour. she believed talley would kill her. as for the letter identified as exhibit 55, wilson regarding a heavy reward for the issue to be dealt with by any according to wilson, talley had previously told her he had discovered it would cost him $500 to have her killed and he had, or would, follow through on that plan if she ever crossed him. she understood his language in exhibit 55 about a hefty reward and [ing] with the issue by as referring to his previously threatened murder-for-hire plan. questions during direct examination, but elected not to cross-examine wilson or kuhn. for the misdemeanor counts, the prosecutor introduced additional letters, with postmarked envelopes, to support the charges talley had violated the protective order by writing to wilson. the prosecutor informed the jury that this evidence, exhibits 2 through 26, corresponded numerically to misdemeanor counts 2 through 26.5 the envelopes in exhibits 2 through 20 and 26 contained postmarks between june 2014 and september 2015. there were no dates associated with exhibits 21 through 25, but wilson testified she received them from talley after she had obtained the protective order. each communication, the 5 the people voluntarily dismissed count 27 before closing arguments. 8 prosecutor argued, was a separate violation of section 166, subdivision (c). 4. the verdict and sentence the jury found talley guilty on all charges. in a bifurcated proceeding talley waived his right to a jury trial on the special allegations and admitted he had suffered a prior felony conviction for making a criminal threat, a serious felony within the meaning of both the three strikes law and section 667, subdivision (a). the court sentenced talley to 11 years for making a criminal threat, plus 5,460 consecutive days in county jail for the misdemeanor counts.6 discussion 1. making a criminal threat to prove the crime of making a criminal threat under section 422, the prosecution must establish (1) the defendant willfully threatened to commit a crime that will result in death or great bodily injury to another person; (2) the defendant made the threat with the specific intent that the statement be taken as a threat, even if there is no intent of actually carrying it out; (3) the 6 the court imposed the upper term of three years for making a criminal threat, doubled under the three strikes law, plus five years for the prior serious felony conviction under section 667, subdivision (a). the court imposed and stayed under section 654 a term of 10 years (the upper term of five years, doubled under the three strikes law) for the stalking count. the court also imposed 364 days in county jail on each of counts 2 through 16 to be served consecutively to count 1 and to each other (for an aggregate consecutive term of 5,460 days on those counts) and 364 days each on counts 17 through 26, to be served concurrently with count 1. 9 threat was on its face or under the circumstances in which it was made so unequivocal, unconditional, immediate, and specific as to convey to the person threatened a gravity of purpose and an immediate prospect of execution of the threat; (4) the threat actually caused the person threatened to be in sustained fear for y; circumstances. ( 422; see in re george t. (2004) 33 cal.4th 620, 630; people v. toledo (2001) 26 cal.4th 221, 227-228.) the surrounding circumstances, both before and after the threat is made, give meaning to the actual words used. (in re george t., supra, 33 cal.4th at p. 637.) even an ambiguous statement may be a basis for a violation of section 422 if the surrounding circumstances clarify the words used were intended to convey a criminal threat. (ibid. communication]; people v. butler (2000) 85 cal.app.4th 745, 754 that give meaning to the actual words used. even an ambiguous people v. mendoza (1997) 59 history can also be considered as one of the relevant e words were intended as a criminal threat].) section 422 requires the threat to be immediate and specific as to convey a gravity of purpose and an immediate prospect of executionthe legislature made clear that unconditionality, immediacy and specificity are not absolutely mandated, 10 whether a threat, in light of the surrounding circumstances, conveys those impressions to the victim. (people v. bolin (1998) 18 cal.4th 297, 339; accord, people v. stanfield (1995) 32 cal.app.4th 1152, 1157; see people v. wilson (2010) 186 cal.app.4th 789, 806 (wilson) was not meant to prohibit prosecution of all threats involving an if clause, but only to prohibit prosecution based on threats whose conditions precluded them from conveying a gravity of purpose and imminent prospect of execution.) talley contends there was insufficient evidence he threatened wilson with great bodily injury or death in exhibit 55, or that his words were anything more than an innocuous rant to respond to his queries about his motorcycle and his watch. (see people v. felix (2001) 92 punish emotional outbursts, it targets only those who try to 7 talley likens this case to in re ricky t. 7 in considering a claim of insufficient evidence in a criminal any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime . . . beyond a reasonable doubt.

(id. ly quarreled, or addressed contentious, hostile, or offensive remarks ibid.circumstances within the meaning of section 422 can show whether a [criminal] threat was made, absence of circumstances can that one was not made within the meaning of section 422. (ibid.) like the purported threats in ricky t., talley contends his statement is ambiguous with no intent to convey a threat of bodily injury or death. he referred to a for the return of his motorcycle, not to convey a murder-for-hire plan. any ambiguity in that regard, he argues, was clarified by other language in the letter informing wilson he intended to obtain a it is the exclusive province of the trial judge or jury to determine the credibility of a witness and the truth or falsity of the facts upon which a determination depends.

(in re ryan d. (2002) 100 cal.app.4th 854, 860.) what matters is that he intended to convey to wilson an imminent prospect of execution if she did not do what he asked of her. (ibid.; people v. mosley (2007) 155 cal.app.4th 313, 323.) talley wrote to wilson warning her he would be released in a matter of months. he had also in the past indicated that he had or would hire someone to kill her if she were to obtain a restraining order or otherwise try to escape him. the jury, in exhibit 55 past relationship, found talley intended to convey to wilson a threat that he would harm or kill her if she did not do what he asked of her. substantial evidence supports threat conveyed an immediate prospect of execution. (see people v. smith (2009) 178 cal.app.4th 475, 481 [even though defendant was in texas, d intelligently conclude[] it was reasonable for s.j. to fear defendant would follow through on the threatsthis conclusion is based on the totality of the circumstances including the long and escalating history of ; wilson, supra, 186 cal.app.4th at pp. 815-816 [incarcerated s statement to upon his release from prison in 10 months was sufficiently immediate to constitute a criminal threat; vely made an appointment 14 people v. gaut (2002) 95 cal.app.4th 1425, 1429, 1432 [incarcerated violent history with his former girlfriend and the expectation of his early release .)8 2. the court did not err in admitting evidence of prior uncharged misconduct character (a predisposition or propensity to engage in a particular type of behavior), including evidence in the form of specific instances of uncharged misconduct, as a basis for an inference that he or she acted in conformity with that character on a particular occasion. (evid. code,  1101, subd. (a); people v. daveggio and michaud (2018) 4 cal.5th 790, 823; people v. 8 talley also contends the failure to admit his letters in their entirety, particularly exhibit 55, and to exclude those that were incomplete, deprived the jury of the ability to consider the alleged threat in its full context. (see generally evid. code,  356 [where the same subject may be inquired into by an adverse in re george t., supra, 33 cal.4th at p. 637 [fact finder may evaluate threat in context of surrounding circumstances].) however, talley did not object to the introduction of any of the letters on that ground, let alone exhibit 55 specifically. accordingly, he has forfeited that contention on appeal. (see evid. code,  353, subd. (a); people v. alexander (2010) 49 cal.4th 846, 912 [failure to object to introduction of evidence forfeits ive contention that his counsel was ineffective in failing to object is addressed in section 4, below. 15 ewoldt (1994) 7 cal.4th 380, 393.) however, this rule does not prohibit admission of evidence of uncharged misconduct when or disposition (see evid. code,  1101, subd.

(evid. code,  1101, subd. (b); leon, at p. 599; people v. kipp (1998) 18 cal.4th 349, 369.) although talley contends the evidence of his prior acts of violence toward wilson was improper character evidence, the trial court correctly ruled that evidence was admissible for the limited purposes s actual and reasonable fear of him.

(see people v. lindberg (2008) 45 cal.4th 1, 25-26 [no abuse of discretion when evidence of uncharged misconduct had substantial probative value, presentation was relatively brief and trial court provided limiting instruction]; people v. davidson (2013) 221 cal.app.4th 966, 973 [same].)10 9 evidence code section 352 authorizes a court to exclude evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the probability that its admission will necessitate undue consumption of time or create substantial danger of undue prejudice, confusing the issues or misleading the jury. undue emotional bias against the defendant with very little effect on (people v. valdez (2012) 55 cal.4th 82, 133.) the trial court has broad discretion to admit or exclude evidence under evidence code section 352, and its ruling will not be disturbed unless it is arbitrary or irrational. (people v. mills (2010) 48 cal.4th 158, 195; people v. williams (2008) 43 cal.4th 584, 634.) 10 because the evidence was admissible for nonpropensity on appeal that the evidence was also admissible under evidence code 17 3. the court did not abuse its discretion in refusing /exclude items in his letters tredacted as unduly prejudicial under evidence code section 352. the court granted some of those requests and denied others. among the evidence the court refused to redact: (1) statement he had used marijuana and had been when he committed certain acts; (2) talley called his mother a said, i pray daily she [(his mother)] drops a toaster in and (3) , by courtand beat up some [word redacted by court] when i was in county talley videntiary rulings compel reversal. evidence of continuing ability to fight was directly relevant to s fear of him and his capacity to cause her great bodily harm, both of which are essential elements of the offense of making a criminal threat. use of marijuana particularly probative, was not unduly prejudicial. and, as to the prosecutor argued, and the court agreed, that the unduly prejudicial. while we might have reached a different section 1109, subdivision (a), which permits propensity evidence in domestic violence cases. 18 was an abuse of its discretion, let alone that that ruling, even if error, resulted in a miscarriage of justice compelling reversal.

(evid. code,  353; people v. partida (2005) 37 cal.4th 428, 439 [erroneous admission of evidence subject to state law harmless error standard].) 4. talley has not demonstrated his trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective talley contends his trial counsel committed numerous errors at trial that deprived him of his right to effective 19 assistance of counsel under the united states and california constitutions. to prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant must two-pronged showing: that counsel performance was deficient, and the defendant was prejudiced, that is, there is a reasonable probability the outcome would have been different were it not for the deficient performance. (people v. woodruff (2018) 5 cal.5th 697, 736; see strickland v. washington (1984) 466 u.s. 668, 694 [104 s.ct. 2052, 80 l.ed.2d 674].) a. failure to object to partial letters did not object to the admissibility of exhibit 55the threat letter on the ground it was incomplete nor did he object to the admission of any of the other letters on that ground. talley argues constitutionally deficient, depriving the jury of the full context of . e of when to object is inherently a (people v. farnam (2002) 28 cal.4th 107, 202; accord, people v. carter (2003) 30 cal.4th 1166, 1209.) an appellate court will intervene in that decision only when there can be no satisfcarter, at p. 1209; people v. kelly (1992) 1 cal.4th 495, 520.) talley does not indicate what the omitted portions of any of the letters said or how, if they were available, they would have made a difference in the outcome. this failure argument. it is entirely conceivable counsel knew the omitted portions of the letters contained matters even more detrimental to talley. in any event, whatever the reason for trial decision, it his trial lack of objection on this ground was both deficient and prejudicial 20 (people v. mickel (2016) 2 cal.5th 181, 198), and he has not come close to carrying it. b. failure to cross-examine witnesses talley also contends his counsel was constitutionally deficient in failing to cross-examine wilson and kuhn at trial. while the rigor of cross-examination is generally left [s] (people v. bolin, supra, 18 cal.4th at p. 334; accord, people v. williams (1997) 16 cal.4th 153, 217), it is unusual that counsel conducted no cross-examination at all. as talley observes, several federal courts ruling on postconviction petitions have found d-examine a key witness, in whole or in part, constitutionally deficient when that omission enabled critical aspects of the testimony to go unrebutted and untested. (see higgins v. renico (6th cir. 2006) 470 f.3d 624, 631, 635-636 [failure to conduct any cross-examination of key witness]; steinkuehler v. meschner (8th cir. 1999) 176 f.3d 441, 446 [failure to impeach key witness with prior inconsistent statement]; nixon v. newsome (11th cir. 1989) 888 f.2d 112, 115 [failure to impeach witness ced an opportunity to greatly weaken with one distinguishable exception, each of the authorities talley relies on involved a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, a procedural posture critically different from direct appeal, where our review is necessarily confined to the evidence in the record and we (people v. mickel, supra, 2 cal.5th at p. 198.) for this reason, defendain establishing ineffective assistance of counsel is 21 court will reverse a conviction based on ineffective assistance of counsel on direct appeal only if there is affirmative evidence that c for an action or id. p. 198; accord, people v. lucas (1995) 12 cal.4th 415, 442-443; see people v. jones (2003) 29 cal.4th 1229, 1263 chose not to object . . . this ineffective assistance of counsel claim would be more appropriately raised in a habpeople v. mendoza tello (1997) 15 cal.4th 264, 266-267 [same].)11 the record in this case does not demonstrate defense it is entirely possible that counsel wanted to avoid inviting evidence of additional prior bad acts or other matters counsel had succeeded in having excluded from trial. furthermore, timony described her strong fear of talley; and counsel might have been concerned about reinforcing that point. although talley suggests his counsel, at the very least, should have emphasized his more ere in -examination of 11 the only decision talley relies on involving a direct appeal is people v. callahan (2004) 124 cal.app.4th 198, 213-214, which affirmed an order granting a new trial on the ground of ineffective assistance of counsel. in granting the motion, the trial was ineffective assistance. in callahan, however, all id. at p. 212.) here, in contrast, all presumptions favor the propriety of strickland v. washington, supra, 446 u.s. at p. 688 [there exists a presumption that the alleged 22 wilson would have only highlighted the jeckyll-and-hyde of the authorities talley cites, the record does not disclose any prior inconsistent statements or the existence of impeachable wilson. simply stated, on this record we cannot say defense c, while certainly unusual, was anything other than sound trial strategy. c. . . ever had to argue. but at the end of the day you have some duties that you have to do in this case. that you do in every then significant burden of proof and asked the jury whether any of the threat? the prosecutor has to prove to you the threat was immediate. it was immediately carried out. has he done that here? is there an immediate threat to be figured out in this case? is there specific threat carried out? was [s]he specifically threatened in this case? there were some statements, but is it a specific threat? and finally, was there an immediate prospect to carrying out the threat? did he immediately carry out the in custody. could he immediately carry out the threat? was that reasonable in this case? did he prove that to you beyond a reasonable doubt? . . . . what i want you to do in this case is simple. look at the evidence. fairly. think about the evidence critically. . . 23 talley contends this closing argument of his counsel was woefully deficient: his counsel failed to answer the questions he posed, neglected to inform the jury that the focus of the inquiry for the criminal threat charge was exhibit 55 and did not address the stalking charge or any of the 25 misdemeanor charges. it is no surprise then, talley asserts, that the jury returned its verdict in a little more than one hour, finding him guilty on all counts. the presumption that counsel engaged in a sound trial [ies] with particular force at closing argument because the decision of how to argue to the jury after the presentation of evidence is inherently tactical. (people v. gamache (2010) 48 cal.4th 347, 391; accord, people v. samayoa (1997) 15 actions were sound trial strategy under the circumstances although the argument was brief, strategy was evident: to focus the jury on the without conceding any charges, he directed the jury to the weakest part of , and argued the people had not carried their burden. defense cacknowledgment at the beginning of his closing argument that he did not have an easy task was not tantamount to suggests an effort to build credibility with the jury in a case involving substantial inculpatory evidence and a sympathetic victim. (see people v. fairbank (1997) 16 cal.4th 1223, 1251 24 . . . counsel must establish as much credibility with the jurors as possible if people v. scott (1997) 15 cal.4th 1188, 1224-1225 [same].) defense counsel told the jury he was confident that the jury, when it reviewed the evidence in conjunction with the questions counsel posed, would remind the jury that exhibit 55 was the focus of count 1making a criminal threat was also not objectively unreasonable. the prosecutor had already identified exhibit 55 as the basis for that count in his initial closing argument.12 the failure to provide a further reminder was not necessary, let alone constitutionally deficient.13 12 in his initial closing argument, and in conformity with the to counsel that either an election or unanimity instruction was necessary, the prosecutor told the jury that the explained that unlike the stalking cthreatpoint again in rebuttal. 13 related contention reversal is required because the court failed to provide an unanimity instruction also fails. (see people v. brown (2017) 11 cal.app.5th 332, 341 [unanimity instruction not required when prosecutor makes a specific election tying each count to specific evidencepeople v. jantz (2006) 137 cal.app.4th 1283, 1292 [unanimity instruction was not required for the section 422 offense of making informed the jury in opening and closing argument that the people were electing the threat set forth in hal 25 finally, talley asserts his counsel was deficient when he told the jury it would receive an instruction that incarceration at the time he made the alleged criminal threat did not matter for the criminal threat count. in fact, talley observes, while the jury was instructed in accordance with calcrim no. 1301 that a person who makes a threat while in jail or prison may still be guilty of stalking, calcrim no. 1300, which instructed the jury on criminal threats, did not contain that clarification. nonetheless, defense counsel was not deficient for stating a point that is correct under the law. as discussed, incarceration at the time the criminal threat was made did not preclude his culpability for making a criminal threat, particularly when the undisputed evidence established that talley had warned wilson his incarceration would be relatively brief. (see wilson, supra, 186 cal.app.4th at p. 808.) talley concedes the jury was properly instructed as to the charge of making a criminal threats statement was constitutionally ineffective. 5. multiple misdemeanor counts (counts 5-14 and 21-26) are time-barred to avoid the bar of the statute of limitations, the prosecution of the misdemeanor offenses like those charged in counts 2 through 26 be commenced within one year after ( 802, subd. (a).) a prosecution is commenced when (a) an indictment or information is filed; (b) a complaint is filed charging a misdemeanor or infraction; (c) the defendant is arraigned on a felony complaint; or (d) an arrest warrant or bench warrant is issued that describes the defendant with the same degree of particularity required for an indictment, information or complaint. ( 804, subds. (a)-(d).) which prosecution of the same person for the same conduct is 26 pending in a court of this state is a part of a limitation of time if the prosecution is not timely commenced and not otherwise tolled, the charge is time-barred. asserting that prosecution of the misdemeanor offenses commenced on september 23, 2015 when the initial information was filed charging him in counts 2 through 26 with violating the april 29, 2014 protective order, talley contends those offenses that were committed before september 23, 2014 are time-barred and his convictions on those counts are void. since the undisputed evidence in the record (the postmarks on the envelopes) demonstrated that counts 2 through 14 and 26 were committed before september 23, 2014,14 he asserts those counts are time-barred. in addition, he contends counts 21 through 25 are similarly time-barred because the record is devoid of evidence from which it can be determined when those letters were sent. a. governing law when the charging document on its face reveals alleged offenses are time-barred, the conviction is void (unless the statute has been tolled) and may be attacked at any time. (people v. williams (1999) 21 cal.4th 335, 341.) if the statutory bar is not apparent from the face of the charging document, timeliness is a 14 the undisputed evidence (the postmarks on the envelopes) established the dates each of the violations for counts 2 through 4 and 26 occurred: count 2, june 6, 2014; count 3, june 13, 2014; count 4, june 13, 2014; count 5, june 13, 2014; count 6, june 16, 2014; count 7, june 16, 2014; count 8, june 19, 2014; count 9, june 23, 2014; count 10, june 30, 2014; count 11, july 21, 2014; count 12, august 25, 2014; count 13, september 11, 2014; count 14, september 12, 2014; and count 26, september 19, 2014. 27 question of proof.

(people v. zamora (1976) 18 cal.3d 538, 563, fn. 25; people v. angel (1999) 70 cal.app.4th 1141, 1147.) the operative information in this case alleged a date range that included both timely and time-barred charges. such an information is not facially deficient. (see people v. smith (2002) 98 cal.app.4th 1182, 1191 [when date range alleged in information encompasses both timely and time-barred claims, reviewing court will determine if action is time-barred based on evidence in record].) the question on appeal, therefore, is simply whether there is substantial evidence in the record to demonstrate the charges were timely filed. (see people v. williams, supra, 21 cal.4th at p. 345; people v. simmons (2012) 210 cal.app.4th 778, 789.)15 15 talley did not forfeit his statute of limitations argument by failing to raise it at trial, notwithstanding the contrary suggestion in several court of appeal decisions. (see, e.g., people v. ortega (2013) 218 hand, the charging document does allege that the action is timely, any objection to the sufficiency of the evidence to prove timeliness must be raised in the trial court in the first instancetypically, people v. hamlin plead facts to avoid the bar of the statute of limitations, and the defendant fails to put the people to their proof in the trial court, then the defendant forfeits the statute of limitations issue and 28 b. counts 5 through 14 and 26 are time-barred; counts 2 through 4 are not the second amended information charged talley in count 2 through 26 of violating a protective order between april 29, 2014 and august 17, 2015. talley asserts, and the people do not dispute, the prosecution of counts 5 through 14 and 26 commenced with the filing of the original information on september 23, 2015. because the undisputed evidence established those offenses were committed more than one year before any prosecution had been initiated, and the people do not contend the limitations period was tolled for those offenses, they are time-barred as a matter of law. counts 2, 3 and 4, in contrast, were pending as of february 9, 2015 when the criminal complaint was filed charging those counts.16 accordingly, for defendant may forfeit the right to litigate specific factual questions concerning the limitations period by not raising them at trial (people v. williams, supra, 21 cal.4th at p. 344), it people v. crosby (1962) 58 cal.2d 713, 725); and a plaintiff does not forfeit arguments relating to sufficiency of the evidence by failing to object in the trial court. (see people v. butler (2003) 31 cal.4th 1119, 1126 & fn. 4 [sufficiency of evidence is an exception to forfeiture doctrine; defendant does not forfeit challenge to sufficiency of evidence by failing to object at trial].) 16 the february 2015 complaint charged talley with making a criminal threat and three counts of contempt under section 166, subdivision (a)(4), for violating a restraining order in los angeles superior court case no. ma062623. count 2 charged talley with violating the restraining order between september 30, 2014 and october 13, 2014; count 3 charged him with disobeying the same restraining order on october 14, 2014; and count 4 charged him with disobeying the same restraining order on january 7, 2015. 29 those counts the pendency of the february 9, 2015 complaint tolled the statute of limitations. ( 803, subd. (b).) talley insists the complaint did not toll the limitations period because it charged in counts 2 through 4 violations of the protective order under a different subdivision of section 166subdivision (a)(4), rather than subdivision (c)(1). talley misapprehends section 803, subdivision (b), which provides for tolling during the time a pending complaint or information was same conduct, whether or not the conduct was charged under the same statute. as the law revision commission explained, the antecedent to section 803, subdivision (b), fno time during which a criminal action is pending is a part of any limitation of the time for recommencing that criminal action in the event of a prior dismissal of that action . . . . that requirement of the same criminal action in that it failed to account for dismissals of charges that were a substantial variation between the previous allegations and the proof. (people v. whitfield (1993) 19 cal.app.4th 1652, 1659, fn. 8, quoting law revision com. com. to  803, subd.

(see  166, subdivision (a), a willful and knowing violation of a protective order or stay-away court order . . . shall constitute contempt of 31 not prove those offenses were committed after september 23, 2014, those convictions are fatally defective.
