(d))1 (count 1), attempted theft from an elder adult ( 664, 368, subd. (d)) (count 2) and two counts of forgery ( 475, subd. (c)) (counts 3 and 4). the information specially alleged as to count 1 butler took property of a value exceeding $65,000 ( 12022.6, subd. (a)(1)).2 2. summary of trial evidence in may 2010 butler began renting a guesthouse from shorr, who was then 86 years old, after family friend and caretaker, teresa yasumi, and her boyfriend, freddie baca, lived in the 1 statutory references are to the penal code. 2 damages, or destroys any property in the commission or attempted commission of a felony, with the intent to cause that taking, damage, or destruction, the court shall impose an additional term as follows: [] (1) if the loss exceeds sixty-five thousand dollars ($65,000), the court, in addition and consecutive to the punishment prescribed for the felony or attempted felony of which the defendant has been convicted, shall impose an 3 main house with shorr. in july 2011 shorr received $335,000 from a reverse mortgage on his home. he placed the funds in a new, interest-bearing checking account at bank of account. after opening the new account, shorr suffered spinal injuries that led to two separate hospital visits and extended stays at a live-in rehabilitation center: the first from august 1, 2011 through september 3, 2011; the second from october 1, 2011 through november 4, 2011. payable to butler. the checks were for varying amounts, ranging from $110 to $52,000 and were dated from august 1, 2011 to november 3, 2011. together, they totaled more than $129,000. s maximizer shorr testified it was not his signature on any of the 25 checks and he did not authorize anyone to write the checks to butler. while in the rehabilitation center, shorr authorized baca to handle his finances and to pay his bills, but not to write checks to butler. when baca visited shorr at the checks at a time. when shorr returned home on november 4, 2011, all his personal belongings, including furniture, clothes and photo albums, were gone. his carpeting, bathroom tile and furniture had been replaced, and his living room repainted. according to shorr, butler told himnot authorize any of the work at his home and he had not asked butler to replace anything. on november 7, 2011 butler attempted to cash another check drawn on one of of america accountsthis one dated november 5, 2011 in the amount of $19,500. by this time, however, branch manager christina chung had placed a risk 4 amounts being taken from his accounts by non-customers. after the bank determined the to cash it. the following day shorr went to the same bank of america branch to withdraw money and was met by chung and assistant branch manager sandy osorio, who reviewed with him the checks written to butler, including the $19,500 check from the previous day. shorr told them he did not sign or authorize any of the checks. when he was arrested on november 8, 2011, butler had in his possession yet 3, 2011 and was for $450. ome from august through november 2011 and was concerned because shorr mortgage so he would have enough money to live. . . . and so it was extremely unusual for him to renovate the home and his consent to cash the checks to pay for the project. according to butler, baca started doing some work on the hoflooring and carpeting and putting in new living room doors. when baca was unable to and i would take pictures of things and the prices and all this kind of stuff, and then show it to [shorr], get his approval and then tell him how much it was going to cost, and then he would write me a check for that agreed to pay him $5,000 for his services and proposed a budget of $108,000 for construction and remodeling. butler hired a contractor and had up to 10 people a day working on the home on various projects, including installation of new windows, carpeting, painting and landscaping. he also bought furniture in advance so it would be ready once the interior was complete. butler 5 checks. he also testified he saw shorr write some of the checks himself. 3. jury instructions, verdict and sentencing the trial court instructed the jury on theft by larceny pursuant to calcrim no. 1800 and possession of a completed check with intent to defraud, a type of forgery, pursuant to calcrim no. 1932. butler did not request a mistake-of-fact or claim-of-right instruction, and neither was given. the jury found butler guilty on all four counts and found the special allegation true. butler was sentenced to an aggregate state prison term of five years, consisting of the upper term of four years for theft from an elder adult plus one year for the excess value enhancement under section 12022.6, subdivision (a)(1), and a concurrent two-year term for one of the forgery counts. sentences for attempted theft and the second forgery count were stayed pursuant to section 654. butler was ordered to pay $129,275 plus 10 percent interest in restitution to the victim, $3,000 in county attorney fees for his appointed defense counsel and $500 in defense investigative costs.3 discussion 1. the trial court did not err in failing to instruct the jury sua sponte on mistake of fact pursuant to calcrim no. 3406 the trial court must instruct the jury on all general principles of law necessary to properly perform a request, the trial court must instruct on the general principles of law relevant to the issues raised by the evidence. [citation.] the general principles of law governing the case are those principles closely and openly connected with the facts before the court, and people v. breverman (1998) 19 includes the obligation to instruct the jury with any affirmative defense supported by substantial 3 in its oral pronouncement at sentencing the court ordered $500 in investigative costs; but the abstract of judgment incorrectly recorded the amount as $5,000. 6 (people v. salas (2006) 37 cal.4th 967, 982; breverman, at p. 157.) butler contends his trial testimony provided substantial evidence he mistakenly accordingly, butler argues the court erred in failing to instruct the jury sua sponte with cthe defendant is not guilty of the [charged crime] if (he/she) did not have the intent or mental state required to commit the crime because (he/she) [reasonably] did not know a fact or [reasonably and] 4 in people v. anderson (2011) 51 cal.4th 989, 997-998, which held trial courts have no duty to instruct sua sponte on a defense that serves only to negate the mental state element of the crime if the jury is otherwise properly instructed on the mental state required to commit the crime. the court explained, evidence to attempt to negate or rebut the prosecutiooffense, a defendant is not presenting a special defense invoking sua sponte instructional evidence to the elements of the offense and sua sponte id. at pp. 996-997; see people v. saille (1991) 54 cal.3d 1103, 1117.) while anderson involved the defense of accident, its reasoning was applied to the mistake-of-people v. lawson (2013) 215 cal.app.4th 108, 117. in 4 testified shorr had approved the remodeling expenditures, butler did not claim he that he mistakenly believed shorr had signed them. to the contrary, butler testified he actually saw shorr sign checks that butler thereafter cashed. 7 lawson the defendant was found guilty of petty theft with priors for stealing a $20 id. at p. 111.) on appeal he argued the jury could have reasonably inferred he simply forgot about the hoodie, which was draped on his shoulders as he paid for the other items and left the store. accordingly, he contended the trial court should have instructed sua sponte on the defense of mistake of fact. (id. at p. 118.) the court of appeal agreed the evidence supported a reasonable inference lawson forgot about the hoodie. because this defense amounted to no more than a claim he took the hoodie without intending to steal it and thus served only to negate the mental state required to commit the crime, however, the court found the theft by larceny instructions givenintended to sufficient to address such a defense. (ibid., the defense of mistake of even if substantial evidence supported an instruction on mistake of fact, the trial court (ibid.) in light of people v. anderson, supra, 51 cal.4th 989, and people v. lawson, supra, 215 cal.app.4th 108, people v. russell (2006) 144 cal.app.4th 1415, upon which butler relies, does not require a different result. russell held the defendant was entitled to a sua sponte mistake-of-fact instruction based on evidence he believed the motorcycle more valuable to the jury than instructions regarding the elements of (russell, at p. 1433.) however, as the lawson anderson, russell is apparently no longer good law to the extent it held the trial court had a duty to instruct sua sponte on the defense of mistake of fact.(lawson, at p. 118.) checks to pay for the construction and remodeling that shorr requested or, at least, he mistakenly believed shorr had authorized it. in either case, he argued, he lacked the intent to steal or defraud. because such a defense serves only to negate the mental state 8 element of the crime and the jury was properly instructed on that element pursuant to calcrim no. 1800 for theft by larceny and calcrim no. 1932 for forgery the court did not have a sua sponte duty to instruct on the defense of mistake of fact.5 2. the trial court did not err in failing to instruct the jury sua sponte on claim of right pursuant to calcrim no. 1863 butler also contends his trial testimony provided substantial evidence he was owed money for the work he performed and, as a result, the court erred in failing to instruct the jury sua sponte with calcrim no. 1863, claim of right. that instruction provides in if the defendant obtained property under a claim of right, he did not have the intent required for the crime of theft. the defendant obtained property under a claim of right if he believed in good faith that he had a right to the specific property or a specific amount of money, and he openly took it. . . . if you have a reasonable doubt about whether the -of-right argument is doubly flawed. first, butler testified shorr agreed to pay him $5,000. even if credited, that testimony does nothing to explain -of-right defense is not established where, as here, an employee unilaterally determines he is entitled to certain wages and, without authorization, appropriates the property of the employer in purported payment of such wages. (people v. holmes (1970) 5 cal.app.3d 21, 23-24; people v. proctor (1959) 169 cal.app.2d 269, 277; people v. ranney (1932) 123 cal.app. 403, 409; see  511 [the unlawful retention of the property of another to offset or pay demands held against him is no defense to a charge of embezzlement].) 5 any error in failing to give a mistake of fact instruction was, in any event, harmless under people v. watson (1956) 46 cal.2d 818, 836. (see people v. russell, supra, 144 cal.app.4th at p. 1431.) by finding butler guilty, the jury necessarily rejected his claim he believed in good faith that shorr had consented to the taking of his -of-fact instruction would have produced a more favorable result for butler. (see watson, at p. 836.) 9 3. onviction for attempted grand theft violates the bailey doctrine in charging butler the people elected to aggregate the 25 checks drawn against to charge him with a separate felony, attempted theft from an elder adult, for his unsuccessful effort on november 7, 2011 to cash yet another check.6 relying on the principle enunciated in people v. bailey (1961) 55 cal.2d 514 (bailey), butler contends he committed only one theft-related offense, not two, because his acts involved a series of takings from the same individual pursuant to one continuing impulse, intent, plan or scheme. (see id. at p. 519.) in bailey the supreme court upheld the conviction of a woman charged with a single count of grand theft by false pretenses (at the time, a theft of more than $200) based upon multiple acts of petty theftimproper receipt of a series of welfare payments following her misrepresentation of the status of a man living in her home. (bailey, supra, 55 cal.2d at pp. 515-518.) addressing the circumstances when multiple thefts of applied in these cases in determining if there were separate offenses or one offense is whether the evidence discloses one general intent or separate and distinct intents. . . . [w]here a number of takings, each less than $200 but aggregating more than that sum, are all motivated by one intention, one general impulse and one plan, the offense is grand theft. [citations.] [] whether a series of wrongful acts constitutes a single offense or multiple offenses depends upon the facts of each case, and a defendant may be properly convicted upon separate counts charging grand theft from the same person if the evidence shows that the offenses are separate and distinct and were not committed pursuant to one id. at p. 519.) 6 it appears the people aggregated the multiple incidents of theft to qualify butler for the one-year enhancement for thefts exceeding $65,000 under section 12022.6, subdivision (a)(1); the single largest check cashed by butler was for $52,000. 10 although bailey itself dealt specifically with the aggregation of petty thefts into a single grand theft count, a number of appellate courts have understood the principle it articulated to apply equally to all theft charges and, as a result, have reversed multiple convictions for grand theft from a single victim when there was insufficient evidence the individual thefts, although factually distinct from each other, were committed pursuant to separate schemes or plans. (see, e.g., people v. packard (1982) 131 cal.app.3d 622, 626-627; people v. tabb (2009) 170 cal.app.4th 1142, 1149-1150; people v. kronemyer (1987) 189 cal.app.3d 314, 363-364.) whether bailey has been properly interpreted as propounding a uniform rule regarding the aggregation of any group of thefts or, instead, applies only to the aggregation of petty thefts to meet the threshold for a felony count of grand theftthat is, whether a defendant who repeatedly takes property exceeding the requisite amount for grand theft from a victim through separate transactions but pursuant to a single scheme or overarching misrepresentation commits more than one offenseis currently pending before the supreme court in people v. whitmer (2013) 213 cal.app.4th 122, review granted may 1, 2013, s208843. to determine the issue presented to us by butler, however, we need not anand decide whether butler could have been charged with, and convicted of, separate theft counts for each individual check he cashed. rather, because the people elected to aggregate into a singthe course of three months, the question here is simply whether the attempt to cash yet another check several days later is separate and distinct from those 25 incidents or whether it should have been included as part of the aggravated felony count as part of the same indivisible scheme. a similar issue was addressed in people v. tabb, supra, 170 cal.app.4th 1142, where the defendant was convicted of one count of grand theft of personal property for taking materials from his pipefitting job without permission and selling them to a recycling company for profit. the single grand theft count reflected an aggregation of petty thefts that took place between january 16, 2007 and april 4, 2007. the defendant 11 was also convicted of one count of petty theft with a prior for stealing additional property on april 4, 2007. (id. at p. 1147.) the court of appeal reversed his conviction for petty that the people may charge tabb with both petty and grand theft by cumulating some, but not all, of the id. at p. 1150.) under a bailey record that would permit a reasonable jury to conclude tabb had a separate and distinct (tabb, at pp. 1150-1151.) similarly, there is no evidence in the record here that would permit a reasonable jury to conclude butler had an intent or plan on november 7, 2011 that was separate or separate papaugust 1, 2011 and early november 2011. nothing distinguishes the final check for $19,500 dated november 5 from the series of 25 earlier checks, which included one dated only two days before and were written for amounts both much lower ($110) and much maximizer account. he also attempted to cash the check in precisely the same manner as the others, going to the same bank of america branch to deposit the check with a teller. was committed pursuant to a different scheme from the successful thefts included within count 1, this conviction must be reversed. 4. the trial court erred in ordering butler to pay attorney fees and investigative costs without hearing evidence regarding his ability to pay section 987.8proceedings in the trial court, the court may, after giving the defendant notice and a hearing, make a determination of his present ability to pay all or a portion of the cost of people v. flores (2003) 30 cal.4th 1059, 1061.) as 12 capability of the defendant to reimburse the costs, or a portion of the costs, of the legal assistance provided to him or her, and shall include, but not be limited to, all of the sition. [] (b) documentary evidence and to confront any witnesses testifying about his ability to pay. conduct of the hearing (see people v. phillips (1994) 25 cal.app.4th 62, 71), whether express or implied the finding of ability to pay must be supported by substantial evidence. (see people v. nilsen (1988) 199 cal.app.3d 344, 347.)7 as butler contends and the people concede, in this case there was no hearing to ecord sufficient to support such a finding.8 accordingly, we remand for a hearing on his ability to pay in accordance with section 987.8.9 (people v. flores, supra, 30 cal.4th at p. 1063 [remand is proper remedy when court orders defendant to pay attorney fees under  987.8 without substantially complying with procedural safeguards enumerated in that section]; people v. verduzco (2010) 210 cal.app.4th 1406, 1421 [if the attorney fee award is in error, 7 there is a presumption that a defendant sentenced to prison does not have the ability to reimburse defense costs. subdivision (g)(2)(b) of section 987.8 provides in shall be determined not to have a reasonably discernible future financial ability to reimburse the costs of his or her defense. 8 an accurate picture of his present ability to pay. 9 booking fees, the right to appeal an order regarding attorney fees is not forfeited. (see people v. mccullough (2013) 56 cal.4th 589, 593; people v. viray (2005) 134 cal.app.4th 1186, 1217.) 13 remand is permissible for the purpose of determining whether the defendant has the ability to pay attorney fees].) disposition order to reimburse the county of los angeles for attorney fees and investigative costs is also reversed and the matter remanded for the trial court either to strike the award of pay. in all other respects the judgment is affirmed. perluss, p. j. we concur: woods, j. zelon, j.
