(schaffer v. superior court (2010) 185 cal.app.4th 1235, 1245.) under subdivisions (b) and (c) of the statute, an order of reimbursement can be made only if the court concludes, after notice and an . . . of the defense costs. ( 987.8, subds. (b), (c), (e); people v. amor (1974) 12 cal.3d 20, 29; people v. phillips, supra, 25 cal.app.4th at p. 7273.)2 court shall set the amount to be reimbursed and order the defendant to pay the sum to the county in the manner in which the court believes reasonable and compatible with the 987.8, subd. (e).) a portion of the defense costs. ( 987.8, subd. (g)(2).) ability to pay requires me of the hearing, his or her 987.8, subds. (g)(2)(a)(d).) likely income and his or her assets. (people v. smith 2 a defendant is provided legal assistance, either through the public defender or private counsel appointed by the court, upon conclusion of the criminal proceedings in the trial court, or upon the withdrawal of the public defender or appointed private counsel, the court may, after notice and a hearing, make a determination of the present ability of the defendant to pay all or a portion of the cost thereof. the court may, in its discretion, hold one such additional hearing within six months of the conclusion of the criminal proceedings. the court may, in its discretion, order the defendant to appear before a county officer designated by the court to make an inquiry into the ability of the defendant to pay all or a 6 (2000) 81 cal.app.4th 630, 642; see, e.g., conservatorship of rand (1996) 49 cal.app.4th 835, 842 [bank account]; people v. whisenand (1995) 37 cal.app.4th 1383, 1394 [real property].) while the statutory language does not mandate an express finding of an ability to pay, the statute contains a presumption that those sentenced to prison do not have the ability to pay. ( 987.8, subd. (g)(2)(b); people v. lopez (2005) 129 cal.app.4th 1508, 1537.) thus, the court must make an express finding of unusual circumstances before ordering a state prisoner to reimburse his or her attorney. (lopez, at p. 1537; cf. people v. phillips, supra, 25 cal.app.4th at p. 71 [where defendant admitted he would be earning $800 per month for two months prior to incarceration, implied finding of ability to pay supported by sufficient evidence].) where the defendant has been deprived of notice and a hearing on his or her ability to pay, the matter may be remanded for a proper determination under section 987.8 of the people v. flores, supra, 30 cal.4th at p. 1069.) as flores may be able to pay something, and if he can, he is obligated by the statue to do so. in any event, . . . sentenced to prison is not [before this court], and rather than speculate about it, we affirm the court of id. at pp. 10681069.) the evidence to support the order, no objection need be made in the trial court. (people v. viray (2005) 134 cal.app.4th 1186, 1217.) thus, defendant did not waive his right to object to the lack of any finding concerning his ability to pay. on the merits, we conclude that the record does not contain substantial evidence that defendant had the ability to pay. the court conducted no evidentiary hearing in the confronted with a denial of his request to represent himself and a denial of his request to 7 substitute in retained counsel is no substitute for an evidentiary hearing to determine whether defendant had sufficient resources to undertake such a financial obligation. thus, we reto pay attorney fees. disposition the judgment of the superior court is affirmed, and the matter is remanded for a er penal code section 987.8. not to be published. johnson, j. we concur: mallano, p. j. chaney, j.
