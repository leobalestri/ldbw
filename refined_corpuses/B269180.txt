filed 3/16/17 p. v. small ca2/1 not to be published in the official reports california rules of court, rule 8.1115(a), prohibits courts and parties from citing or relying on opinions not certified for publication or ordered published, except as specified by rule 8.1115(b). this opinion has not been certified for publication or ordered published for purposes of rule 8.1115. in the court of appeal of the state of california second appellate district division one the people, plaintiff and respondent, v. alex russell small, defendant and appellant. b269180 (los angeles county super. ct. no. va136534) appeal from a judgment of the superior court of los angeles county, robert j. higa, judge. affirmed. winston kevin mckesson for defendant and appellant. kamala d. harris, attorney general, gerald a. engler, chief assistant attorney general, lance e. winters, senior assistant attorney general, paul m. roadarmel., jr., supervising deputy attorney general, and stacy s. 2 schwartz, deputy attorney general, for plaintiff and respondent. a jury convicted alex russell small (small) of second degree robbery (pen. code,  2111) and found true a special allegation that small used a firearm within the meaning of section 12022.53, subdivision (b), making the robbery a serious felony pursuant to section 1192.7, subdivision (c)(8) and a violent felony within the meaning of section 667.5, subdivision (c)(8). on appeal, small contends that there was insufficient evidence to support the juryfirearm allegation and that the trial court improperly denied his motion for a new trial due to a purported lack of evidence supporting the firearm finding. we disagree and, accordingly, affirm the judgment. background i. the robbery on august 21, 2014, around 9:00 a.m., while vanessa sharp (sharp), a wal-mart cashier, assisted a patron at the customer service counter, small and tiequan wilson (wilson) entered the store. the two men sat at a bench to register. at some point, both men stood up at the same time. wilson jumped over the counter and demanded that sharp 1 all further statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise indicated. 3 give them the money in her cash register. as sharp attempted to open her register, small, who remained in front of the counter, raised up his sweatshirt, showing sharp a black semi-automatic pistol that he had partially in his pants although small sharp or press it against her. sharp saw the pistol for approximately five seconds.2 sharp, . . . that [she was] going to be harmed, opened the register and stepped aside. after taking approximately $7,000 wilson ordered sharp o]pen up the next register. sharp again complied because she was wilson took $5,000 more from the second register. small and wilson then fled the store. during the course of the robbery, small said nothing to sharp. ii. the trial on september 22, 2014, the people filed an information charging small with second degree robbery and alleged that 2 at trial, a store manager, who had been alerted by another employee that a robbery was in progress at the customer service counter, saw wilson at one point holding a cash register till in one hand and a gun in the other. during the trial, after the store manager testified, wilson pleaded no contest. 4 he used a firearm during the robbery. at his arraignment, small denied the allegations and pleaded not guilty. on september 9, 2015, the trial court impaneled a jury. the people presented a number of witness, including sharp. during the trial, small presented no witnesses on his behalf. moreover, small did not dispute that he was one of the robbers. instead, he argued only that the evidence did not [ ] the gun at acing. the act of pulling the gun and showing [it] is not menacing3 3 menacing derives from the jury instructions in this case. with regard to the firearm enhancement, the trial court lly uses a firearm if he or she intentionally does any of the following: [] 1. displays the firearm in a menacing manner; [] 2. hits someone with the firearm; [] or [] 3. fires the the instruction regarding the firearm enhancement was apparently drawn from section 1203.06, which used a firearm armed with a firearm. armed with a firearm knowingly carry or have available for use a firearm as a means of offense or defense( 1203.06, subd. (b)(3).) in contrast, used a firearm means to display a firearm in a menacing manner, to intentionally fire it, to intentionally strike or hit a human being with it, or 5 on september 15, 2015, after less than three hours of deliberation, the jury found small guilty of second degree robbery and found true the firearm allegation. pursuant to section 1118, small moved for a new trial on the ground that the evidence did not establish that he used the pistol in a menacing manner (the motion). on october 28, 2015, after hearing oral argument on the motion, the trial court denied it. that same day, the trial court sentenced small to 13 years in state prison. small timely appealed. discussion with regard to the firearm enhancement, small makes was not supported by substantial evidence, because the to use it in any manner that qualifies under section 12022.5.ection 12022.5, like the operative provision here (section 12022.53), imposes a sentence enhancement for the use of a firearm in the commission or attempted commission of a felony. california courts have held that the definition of used a firearm in section 1203.06 applies equally to section 12022.5, suggesting that such an application would also apply to section 12022.53. (see people v. cory (1984) 157 cal.app.3d 1094, 11011104.) although we are unaware of any california court that has expressly held that section 12022.53 allegations, some courts have come close to doing so. (see, e.g., people v. thiessen (2012) 202 cal.app.4th 1397, 14041405; people v. carrasco (2006) 137 cal.app.4th 1050, 1059.) 6 entitled to a new trial based on the lack of substantial evidence to support the firearm enhancement, because the trial court did not understand the meaning of the word menacing when making [its] not persuaded by either argument. i. the firearm finding was supported by substantial evidence a. standard of review whether a defendant used a weapon in committing a (people v. masbruch (1996) 13 cal.4th 1001, 1007.) we review such findings only to determine if they are supported by the light most favorable to the judgment below to determine whether it discloses substantial evidencethat is, evidence that is reasonable, credible and of solid valuefrom which a (people v. snow (2003) 30 cal.4th 43, 66; accord, people v. johnson (1980) 26 cal.3d 557, 578.) we must presume in support of the judgment the existence of every fact the trier could reasonably deduce from the evidence. (people v. rayford (1994) 9 cal.4th 1, 23.) reversal is unwarranted unless it appears that upon no hypothesis whatever is there sufficient (people v. bolin (1998) 18 cal.4th 297, 331.) 7 b. se of firearm is broadly construed section 12022.53, subdivision (b) provides that any person who, in the commission of a felony, such as robbery personally uses a firearm, shall be punished by an additional and consecutive term of imprisonment in the state prison for 10 years. the firearm need not be operable or loaded for this enhancement to apply (italics added.) the legislature created enhancements for defendants who are armed with a firearm in the commission of a felony (see  12022, subd. (a)(1)) and those who personally use a firearm in the commission of a felony (see e.g.,  12022.5, 12022.53). the penalties for the use of a firearm are greater than that those provided for merely being armed at the time a felony is committed. (compare  12022, subds. (a)(1) [one-year enhancement for being armed], and subd. (c) [three, four, or five-commission of certain drug offenses] with  12022.5, subd. (a) [three, four, or 10-year term for personally using a firearm] and 12022.53, subd. (b) [10-year enhancement for personally using firearm in commission of listed offenses].) the difference in penalties corresponds to the difference between the danger presented by one merely being armed, in which case there is the potential that the firearm will be employed in the commission of a felony, and the use of the weapon, in which case the firearm was employed in the commission of the felony. (see people v. chambers (1972) 7 cal.3d 666, 672 (chambers).) 8 in chambers, supra, 7 cal.3d 666, our supreme court [citation.] the obvious legislative intent to deter the use of firearms in the commission of the specified felonies requir be (id. at p. 672.) two casespeople v. granado (1996) 49 cal.app.4th 317 (granado) and people v. hays (1983) 147 cal.app.3d 534 (hays)4illustrate how use should be construed in the context of firearm enhancements. in granado, supra, 49 cal.app.4th 317, the defendant and a cohort approached two men to demand money. the chete, causing one victim to run away with the machete wielder in pursuit. the defendant pulled a gun from his waistband without pointing it at anyone, and demanded money from the remaining victim. the defendant was convicted of attempted robbery of both victims and of personally using a firearm against both. (id. at pp. 320321.) on appeal, the defendant argued that with regard to the second victim the use enhancement could not apply because merely displaying the gun did not constitute using it. (idcontention, the granado court observed that the personal 4 in both of these cases, the enhancement at issue was section 12022.5, not as here section 12022.53. 9 gun use statutes are broadly construed in order to deter the increased risk of serious injury that accompanies any deployment of a gun during the commission of a crime. (id. at p. 322.) although mere possession of a gun is not enough, if the defendant displays a gun or otherwise makes its presence known for the purpose of intimidating the victim or others in order to carry out the underlying crime, there is sufficient facilitative use of the weapon for purposes of the firearm use enhancements. (id. at p. 325.) in hays, supra, 147 cal.app.3d 534, the defendant, with a sawed-off rifle strapped to his shoulders, crashed through the ceiling of a drugstore he planned to rob. (id. at p. 539.) the gun was in full view of two store employees while the defendant committed the underlying crime. (ibid.) but there was no evidence the in a (id. at pp. 544, 549.) the hays court struck the use enhancement because the defendant only (id. at pp. 548549.) hays, supra, 147 cal.app.3d 534 and granado, supra, 49 cal.app.4th 317 make clear that the dividing line between use and merely armed or in possession of a firearm -related conduct constitutes an affirmative act in furtherance of a crime or is merely a passive or inadvertent exposure of the gun. armed] is functional: did the defendant take some action with the gun in furtherance of the commission of the crime? 10 penalty . . . applies. if, on the other hand, the defendant engaged in no weapons-related conduct, or such conduct was and only the lesser enhancement . . . (granado, at p. 324, fn. 7, italics omitted.) thus when a defendant deliberately shows a gun, or otherwise makes its presence known, and there is no evidence to suggest any purpose other than intimidating the victim (or others) so as to successfully complete the underlying offense, the jury is entitled to find a facilitative use rather than an incidental or inadvertent exposure. the defense may freely urge the jury not to draw such an inference, but a failure to actually point the gun, or to issue explicit threats of harm, does not entitle the defendant to judicial exemption from section granado, supra, 49 cal.app.4th at p. 325, italics added.) c. there was substantial evidence that small used a firearm in committing the robbery small argues that the testimony at trial established only tstand on the other side sharp for five seconds. misses the point. under the law, that was more than enough to justify the firearm enhancement. property in the possession of another, from his person or 11 immediate presence, and against his will, accomplished by means of force or fear ( 211, italics added; see generally people v. gomez (2008) 43 cal.4th 249, 254257; people v. anderson (1966) 64 cal.2d 633, 638640.) here, sharp knew small had a gun, because he very deliberately showed it to her. more critically, he showed her the gun in such a way as to intimidate sharpthat is, small displayed the gun in order to show her that he had the capability to use deadly demands. and, the jury reasonably found, testimony about being afraid, that his intimidating display was successful. moreover, there was no evidence to suggest any purpose other than to intimidate sharp. in sum, there was substantial evidence that gun-related conduct was not incidental to the charged crime, but functionally related theretothat is, the display of the pistol was employed to further the commission of the robbery. arespect to the firearm enhancement. ii. the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it denied small a new trial a. standard of review section 1181 provides that the trial court may grant a new trial when it finds that the verdict or finding is contrary to the law or the evidence. section 1181, in relevant part provides: made against the defendant, the court may, upon his 12 application, grant a new trial . . .
