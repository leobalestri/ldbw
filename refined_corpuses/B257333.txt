filed 8/12/15 people v. morales ca2/4 not to be published in the official reports california rules of court, rule 8.1115(a), prohibits courts and parties from citing or relying on opinions not certified for publication or ordered published, except as specified by rule 8.1115(b). this opinion has not been certified for publication or ordered published for purposes of rule 8.1115. in the court of appeal of the state of california second appellate district division four the people, plaintiff and respondent, v. julio morales, defendant and appellant. b257333 (los angeles county super. ct. no. va109499) appeal from a judgment of the superior court of los angeles county, larry s. knupp, judge. affirmed as modified. edward h. schulman, under appointment by the court of appeal, for defendant and appellant. kamala d. harris, attorney general, gerald a. engler, chief assistant attorney general, lance e. winters, assistant attorney general, mary sanchez and elaine f. tumonis, deputy attorneys general, for plaintiff and respondent. 2 julio morales was convicted by jury in 2011 of raping an unconscious person in violation of penal code section 261, subdivision (a)(4).1 in a prior appeal, we reversed his conviction due to instructional error and remanded for a retrial.2 (people v. morales (2013) 212 cal.app.4th 583 (morales)). on remand, defendant again was found guilty. defendant raises four arguments in this appeal. first, he argues that the trial court erred by not instructing the jury on the mayberry defense, which would have enabled the jury to find him not guilty if he had held a reasonable and good faith belief that the victim consented. (people v. mayberry (1975) 15 cal.3d 143 (mayberry).) second, he argues that a portion of the jury instructions contravened our holding in the prior appeal and incorrectly prevented third, he contends that the cumulative effect of the above errors prejudiced his due process right to a fair jury determination of his guilt. restitution fine violated his constitutional protections against ex post facto laws and double jeopardy. we conclude ree arguments are without merit. however, we further conclude that the trial court violated the california ex post facto prohibition as well as its double jeopardy prohibition in increasing the restitution fine to $280 from the $200 restitution fine imposed at the original trial. thus, we affirm the judgment and modify the restitution fine to be in the amount of $200. 1 further unspecified statutory references are to the penal code. 2 the error was due to an anachronism in former section 261, subdivision (a)(4), which made sexual intercourse by impersonation a rape only when the victim was married. (morales, supra, 212 cal.app.4th at p. 595.) the statute was amended in september 2013. (stats. 2013, ch. 259,  1 (ab no. 65).) 3 factual and procedural background prosecution evidence a few hours after midnight on february 21, 2009, 18-year-old jane doe left a party with her boyfriend victor, her brother f.friends, including defendant. jane had consumed four to five beers. jane, victor, and a friend at, where jane changed into pajamas before eating. defendant arrived with f. and several others shortly afterward. after eating in the living room, jane and victor went into her bedroom and lay down on the bed. they discussed having sex, but declined because victor did not have a condom. about one hour later, victor left jane, who was then asleep, and returned to his house. defendant, f., and two or three others were in the living room when victor left. jane awoke to the sensation of sex. she saw d by a sliver of light coming through the door. she pushed back, and defendant grabbed her thighs and reinserted his penis into her vagina. she began yelling and crying, and defendant then left the room. jane immediately telephoned victor, who drove ba. victor saw defendant walking away and called the police shortly after arriving at the house. los angeles county sheriff deputy peralta saw defendant several blocks from the house, and another deputy eventually arrested him. jane identified defendant in a lineup. patrol car, defendant spoke to deputy sheriff judith leyn. after receiving his miranda rights (miranda v. arizona (1966) 384 u.s. 436), defendant told deputy leyn the following: he saw victor leave the house. he noticed that jane was asleep. he lay down on her bed and began rubbing her vagina, and noticed she was still asleep. he then tried to leave the room, but the 4 door was being held shut so he returned and began kissing jane. she began kissing him back. he got on top of her, pulled her pajama bottoms down to her thighs, and inserted his penis into her vagina. jane began to wake, and defendant told her he was not her boyfriend. jane began screaming, and defendant left the house and started walking home. about seven hours after this oral statement, defendant gave a written statement at the police station. defense evidence droom, at . they attempted to wake jane so she could drink with them, but she remained asleep. defendant tried to leave the room, but the door was shut and it appeared to defendant that someone was holding the door closed. tony was no longer in the room. defendant nudged jane again, but she did not move. the two began kissing with the lighwas removed. defendant believed jane was awake because she was kissing him back and had put her hand on his shoulder. the two began having sex. defendant stopped when he realized he was betraying his girlfriend; he left the room despite some resistance from the other side of the door. defendant began walking home. he hid from the police because he did not want to get a ticket for being a minor under the influence of alcohol. procedural background on october 1, 2009, the people charged defendant with raping an unconscious person, in violation of section 261, subdivision (a)(4). a jury found defendant guilty in december 2010. 5 following our reversal and remand, in march 2014, a jury again found defendant guilty of rape of an unconscious person in violation of section 261, subdivision (a)(4). at sentencing, the court stated that it concurred with the sentenced him to a prison term of three years, which defendant already had served. the court also restitution fine appellant filed a timely notice of appeal. discussion i. failure to instruct on the mayberry defense was not error defendant argues that the trial court erred by not instructing the jury on the mayberry defense: that a defendant who has a reasonable and good faith belief that a person voluntarily consented to sexual intercourse lacks the wrongful intent necessary to be convicted of rape by force or threat. (mayberry, supra, 15 cal.3d at p. 155.) the mayberry defense is inapposite for several reasons. first, mayberry concerned rape by force or threat, not rape of an unconscious person. (mayberry, supra, 15 cal.3d at pp. 154-155.) more importantly, imorales, supra, 212 cal.app.4th at p. 596.) its opinion a principle or rule of law necessary to the decision, that principle or rule becomes (people v. barragan (2004) 32 cal.4th 236, 246.) the evidence on retrial of the ruling was based. (ibid.) because we already have decided the issue, and the 6 evidence on retrial was substantially the same as the evidence on which our prior opinion was based, mayberry defense.3 appeared to respond favorably to his kisses and touching, the trial court erred by failing to give instructions that would have allowed the jury to consider his good (morales, supra, 212 cal.app.4th at p. 596.) we addressed the issue on the to the victims consent is not relevant; it is the defendants knowledge that the victim was unconscious and his intent to engage in an act of sexual intercourse with an unconscious person that makes that act a crime under section 261, ibid.) this holding is law of the case. the evidence on retrial was substantially the same as that on which our prior opinion was based. in the prior appeal, defendant relied on his testimony that jane appeared to respond favorably to his kisses and touching to argue that the trial court erroneously failed to instruct the jury that he held a good faith belief that jane consented to sexual intercourse. (see morales, supra, 212 cal.app.4th at p. 588 to his kisses.].) on retrial, defendant again testified that he believed jane was awake because she returned his kisses and placed her hand on his shoulder and neck. there is no material difference between the evidence on which our prior opinion was based and the evidence on retrial. the trial court did not err in not instructing on the mayberry defense. 3 we further note that, by finding defendant guilty of rape of an unconscious person, the jury necessarily determined that jane was not able to give consent. 7 ii. calcrim no. 1003 did not misstate the law the trial court instructed the jury pursuant to calcrim no. 1003. the court included the following instruction: uired to prove a lack of consent. consent occurs when the person acts freely and voluntarily with knowledge of the nature of the act or transaction involved. [] a woman is unconscious of the nature of the act if she is unconscious, asleep, or not aware that the act is occurring. if a woman is unconscious or asleep, she necessarily does not defendant argues that the phrase, transaction, misstated the law on two grounds. first, defendant contends that the nt. second, defendant contends that the instruction directly contravenes our holding in morales. we are not persuaded. first, as discussed above, consent is not relevant to the charged crime. (morales, supra, 212 cal.app.4th at p. 596.) thus, even if the instruction focused consent, this focus is inconsequential. rather, ithat the victim was unconscious and his intent to engage in an act of sexual intercourse with an unconscious person that makes that act a crime under section ibid.) the jury was properly instructed ndant knew that the woman was unable to resist because she was unconscious of the simply contends that the instruction ages 589-596 of our prior 8 opinion, and does not explain this argument any further. (people v. mitchell (2008) 164 cal.app.4th 442, 467; see also people v. freeman (1994) 8 cal.4th 450, 482, fn. 2 [arguments asserted perfunctorily and insufficiently developed are not cognizable on appeal]; cal. rules of court, rule 8.204(a)(1)(b) [appellate brief .) defendant contends that the cumulative effect of the alleged errors regarding the mayberry defense and the jury instruction prejudiced his right to due process. because we have found no error, there is no cumulative effect that may have iii. the increase of the restitution fine from $200 to $280 violated proscriptions against ex post facto laws and against double jeopardy defendant contends that the trial court violated constitutional proscriptions against ex post facto laws by imposing a restitution fine in the amount of $280 rather than $200.4 defendant argues that the court mistakenly applied the version of section 1202.4 in effect at the time of sentencing, rather than the version in effect at the time of his offense. in his reply brief, he further contends that the increased fine violated the state constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy. 4 in 2009, section 1202.4, subdivision (b)(1) set the minimum restitution fine for a felony at $200 and the maximum at $10,000. the statute was amended in 2011 to the court and commensurate with the seriousness of the offense, but shall not be less than two hundred forty dollars ($240) starting on january 1, 2012, two hundred eighty dollars ($280) starting on january 1, 2013, and three hundred dollars ($300) starting on january 1, 2014, 1202.4, subd. (b)(1).) 9 when defendant originally was sentenced, the court ordered him to pay a $200 restitution fine under section 1202.4, subdivision (b), the minimum amount under the statute at the time. following his retrial, the court stated that it agreed n ordered defendant the court did not explain the reason for the discrepancy between the $200 originally imposed and the $280 amount. the application of the law in effect rather than the law applicable at the time of the offense violates the constitutional prohibition against ex post facto laws. (people v. souza (2012) 54 cal.4th 90, 143 (souza).) punishment, and therefore is subject to the proscriptions of the ex post facto clause ibid.) defendant concedes that he did not challenge the $280 restitution fine below. respondent accordingly contends that defendant has forfeited his challenge to the amount imposed. defendant contends that the fine is an unauthorized sentence and thus may be raised for the first time on appeal. laim of circumstance in though otherwise permitted by law, were imposed in a procedurally or factually 10 people v. scott (2012) 203 cal.app.4th 1303, 1309.) respondent counters that the sentence was not unauthorized because the maximum fine under the statute in effect at the time of his offense was $10,000. (see people v. kramis (2012) 209 cal.app.4th 346, 349-350.) thus, the argument goes, a fine of $280 to impose. below, we exercise our discretion to address the issue for several reasons. first, t. . . would likely have the effect of converting an appellate issue into a habeas corpus claim of ineffective assistance of counsel for failure to preserve the question by timely objection . . . , we would be loath to invoke a rule that would proliferate rather than reduce the nature and scope of legal proceedings. [citation.] after all, judicial economy is a principal rationale of the forfeiture doctrine. 5 (people v. butler (2003) 31 cal.4th 1119, 1128; see also people v. turner forestall claims of ineffective as; people v. barber (2002) 102 cal.app.4th 145, 150 [constitutional issues not raised below may be reviewed on appeal]; people v. blanco (1992) 10 cal.app.4th 1167, 1173 [exercising discretion subsequent habeas corpus people v. norwood (1972) 26 cal.app.3d 148, 153 (norwood) [ 5 (see people v. martinez (2014) 226 cal.app.4th 1169, 1190 (martinez) [holding that trial violation of ex post facto laws, constituted ineffective assistance].) 11 which is shown by the appeal record to be vulnerable to habeas corpus proceedings based upon constitutional grounds may be considered upon direct appeal. ].) in addition, won that the record is unclear that the court intended to impose the minimum fine authorized by section 1202.4 at the time of the offense. . rather, the court explicitly prior case and concurred with the prior against ex post facto laws applies to restitution fines. (martinez, supra, 226 cal.app.4th at p. 1189; people v. valenzuela (2009) 172 cal.app.4th 1246, 1248.) in martinez, similar to the instant case, the trial court imposed a restitution fine based on the $280 minimum in the 2013 version of section 1202.4, even though the minimum restitution fine was $200 at the time the defendant committed his offenses. on appeal, the court stated that it and found (martinez, supra, 226 cal.app.4th at p. 1190.) the court thus recalculated the restitution fine and modified the judgment. (id. at pp. 1190-1191; see also souza, supra, 54 cal.4th at p. 143 [recalculating a restitution fine under section 1202.4 because it violated the statutory maximum under the statutes applicable at the time of thcrimes]; valenzuela, supra, 172 cal.app.4th at pp. 1248-1250 [modifying a fine under  290.3, subd.

(people v. baniqued (2000) 85 cal.app.4th 13, 29.) nevertheless, we may address the double jeopardy question as an issue of law because it is undisputed that defendant received a $200 restitution fine after his first trial and a $280 restitution fine following the retrial. (see people v. masotti (2008) 163 cal.app.4th 504, 508 [question of law not asserted by the parties may be addressed where necessary]; norwood, suprapeople v. mccullough (2013) 56 cal.4th 589, 594 [legal error in sentencing asserted for the first time on appeal may be moreover, the failure to assert double jeopardy in the trial court could constitute ineffective assistance. (see, e.g., people v. holloway (2004) 33 cal.4th 96, 155, fn. 18 in the trial court because of ineffective assistance claim]; people v. marshall (1996) 13 cal.4th 799, 824, fn. 1 [although defendant raised double jeopardy claim for the first time merit and tridefense, then defendant would have been denied the effective assistance of counsel to 13 ) the california supreme court explained in hanson that an increase in a restitution fine following a successful appeal may constitute hanson, supra, 23 cal.4th at p. 366.) in daniels, the defendant was ordered to pay $3,400 in restitution after his first trial. however, after his conviction was overturned on appeal, he was retried and reconvicted. following his second trial, he was ordered to pay $10,000 in argument, despite his failure to object to the sentence below, and ordered the restitution fine reduced to the amount ordered following the first trial. (daniels, supra, 208 cal.app.4th at pp. 31-33.) similarly, in people v. wardell (2008) 162 cal.app.4th 1484, the ncluded a $200 restitution fine. however, following his successful appeal and retrial, the trial court imposed a $10,000 given greater punishment on a retrial for the privilege of exercising his right to te court modified the judgment to reduce the restitution fine to $200. (id. at p. 1496.) pursuant to hanson, daniels, and wardell, the increase in the restitution fine double jeopardy. we therefore modify the judgment to reduce the restitution fine from $280 to $200. 14 disposition the judgment is modified by reducing the $280 restitution fine to $200. in all other respects, the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports willhite, j. we concur: epstein, p. j. manella, j.
