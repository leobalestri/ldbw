(b)(1)), a $30 criminal conviction assessment (gov. code,  70373), and a $40 court operations assessment ( 1465.8, subd. (a)(1)). defendant filed this timely appeal. discussion i. self-defense instruction defendant argues that the trial court erred in refusing to instruct the juryinitially and after the jury noteon the theory of perfect self-defense. the defense of perfect self-defense is available only when reasonably bel(people v. humphrey (1996) 13 cal.4th 1073, 1082 (humphrey), italics omittednecessary to defend himpeople v. jefferson (2004) 119 cal.app.4th 508, 519; humphrey, at p. 1088; people v. hernandez (2011) 51 cal.4th 733, 747, citing calcrim no. 3470.) perfect self- 6 that combat. (people v. ross (2007) 155 cal.app.4th 1033, 1045 (ross).) a trial court has a duty to instruct on a requested defense (people v. villanueva (2008) 169 cal.app.4th 41, 49.) in evaluating whether substantial evidence supports a defense, we ask whether the evidence presented at trial, when viewed in the light most favorable to the defense, is enough for a reasonable jury to find that the elements of the defense have been established. (people v. breverman (1998) 19 cal.4th 142, 159; people v. mentch (2008) 45 cal.4th 274, 290.) we independently (people v. orlosky (2015) 233 cal.app.4th 257, 270.) instruct the jury on perfect self-defense for three reasons. first, there was no substantial evidence to support a jury knox and his medical boot. the uncontradicted testimony is that it took knox one or two minutes to unlatch his boot, which is more than enough time for defendant to have retreated from knox, who without the boot walked with a wobbly limp. any reasonable person could have simply walked away. but defendant waited. his patience in waiting for an opportune time to lunge at knox precludes a finding of perfect self-defense. second, there was no substantial evidence to support a jury mmediate use of force was necessary to boot. again, the uncontradicted testimony is that knox never 7 verbally threatened to use the boot and never engaged in any threatening conduct with the boot that would have caused a reasonable person to believe that the boot would be used in the melee at all. (cf. people v. sam (1969) 71 cal.2d 194, 199, 213 -defense available].) lastly, there was uncontroverted evidence that defendant and who then waited for knox to remove his boot before lunging at him with a knife. defendant resists this conclusion with four arguments. first, he maintains that there was substantial evidence to support a finding that the imminent use of force was necessary attacks and knox reluctance to appear as a witness gave the jury ample reason to disregard his uncontroverted testimony that he did nothing with the boot, and (2) even without those inconsistencies, a reasonable person could reasonably assume that the boot, once removed, would then be used as a weapon. but neither of these premises is supported by any evidence; they [s]peculation people v. ramon (2009) 175 cal.app.4th 843, 851). further, even if we accepted these arguments, they would at most eliminate one of the three reasons set forth above as to why a perfect self-defense instruction was unwarranted. second, defendant contends that he is not disqualified from relying on perfect self-defense for failing to attempt to withdraw after initiating a mutual combat because, in his view, mutual 8 combat is triggered only by violence (and not mere words), such that the mutual combat in this case did not start until after knox took ofwithdraw). this contention is legally incorrect. what defines combat, but the preexisting intention to engage in itross, supra, 155 cal.app.4th at p. 1045.) this includes words. (see people v. rogers (1958) 164 that offer bseek to withdraw from the mutual combat he initiated disqualified him from relying on perfect self-defense. third, defendant asserts that knox bragged during his trial ghter. however, this assertion does not factor into either the objective or subjective assessments of the need to act in self-defense because nothing knox said or did during his encounter with defendant communicated his internal belief in his own fighting skill. (accord, people v. stansbury (1995) 9 cal.4th 824, 827- lastly, defendant argues that his decision to wait for law enforcement to arrive rather than to flee constitutes substantial evidence that he was entitled to a perfect self-defense instruction. post-offense conduct and whether substantial evidence supports the elements of perfect self-defense that existed before and during the offense. ii. restitution fine and assessments relying upon dueas, defendant contends that the trial 9 assessments without an ability to pay hearing (1) violated due process and (2) constituted cruel and unusual punishment. these are constitutional questions that we review de novo. (people v. ramos (1997) 15 cal.4th 1133, 1154.) -based argument for two reasons. first, the sole basidueas, supra, 30 cal.app.5th 1157. however, we have rejected dueass reasoning. (see people v. hicks (2019) 40 cal.app.5th 320.) second, even if dueas conduct an ability to pay hearing when imposing $370 in monetary obligations was harmless because defendant will earn that amount as prison wages prior to his release. (accord, people v. johnson [defendant] cannot afford to pay $370 while serving an eight-year and to the extent defendant argues that the $370 in monetary obligations constitutes cruel and unusual punishment, we reject that argument as well. whether such an obligation is excessive disproportional (united states v. bajakajian (1998) 524 u.s. 321, 334, superseded by statute on other grounds as stated in united states v. jose (2001) 499 f.3d 105, 110.) factors relevant to gross relationship between the harm and the penalty; (3) the penalties [citations.people ex rel. lockyer v. r.j. reynolds tobacco co. ability to pay is a factor, not the only factor. (bajakajian, at pp. 337-338.) applying these factors, we conclude that the minimum 10 monetary obligations totaling $370 are not grossly disproportionate to his crime of assaulting someone with a knife that resulted in substantial and lasting injuries. 11 disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. ______________________, j. hoffstadt we concur: _________________________, p.j. lui _________________________, j. ashmann-gerst
