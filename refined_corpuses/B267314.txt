(smith v. robbins (2000) 528 u.s. 259, 277-284 [120 s.ct. 746, 145 l.ed.2d 756]; people v. kelly (2006) 40 cal.4th 106, 118-119; people v. wende (1979) 25 cal.3d 436, 441-442.) proposition 47 created a resentencing provision: penal code2 section 1170.18. under section 1170.18, a person ense that is now a misdemeanor under proposition 47, may petition for recall of that sentence and request resentencing in accordance with the statutes that were added or amended by proposition 47.

[the] defendant to show the facts demonstrating his eligibility for relief . . . people v. page (2015) 241 cal.app.4th 714, 719, fn. 2.) i]t is entirely appropriate to allocate the initial burden of proof to the petitioner to establish the facts upon which his or her eligibility (people v. sherow (2015) 239 cal.app.4th 875, 880 [the defendant failed to meet his burden under  1170.18 as he did not prove that the goods he was convicted of taking had a value of $950 or less].) here, morales failed to show any facts to demonstrate his eligibility for relief. construed generously, his argument is that trespass on a residential property is the type of theft conviction 2 all further statutory references are to the penal code. 4 which the voters intended to reclassify when they approved proposition 47. the voters, however, made only one amendment to the definition of burglary for purposes of resentencing: proposition 47 added section 459.5 to the penal code, creating a new crime of shoplifting, a misdemeanor offense that punishes certain conduct that previously would have qualified as a burglary. (people v. hallam (2016) ___ cal.app.5th ___, ___ [2016 cal.app.lexis 807, *4], fn. omitted.) no other amendments were made to the definition of burglary nor other categories of related conduct reclassified as misdemeanor offenses. morales is not entitled to resentencing under section 459.5, as that section is expressly limited to entry into commercial establishments. (people v. hallam, supra, ___ cal.app.5th at p. ___ [2016 cal.app.lexis at p. *7].) given that morales pleaded guilty to attempted burglary of a residence and even in his brief on appeal indicates that he was on the premises of a residence, his conviction cannot be resentenced as a misdemeanor under section 459.5. the voters enacting proposition 47 did not carve out any burglaries relating to residences and allow them to be recharged as misdemeanors. on this record, the trial court correctly ruled that attempted first degree residential burglary is not one of the theft offenses which a defendant may seek to have designated as a misdemeanor pursuant to section 1170.18, subdivision (f). contention that he was ignorant of the law when he entered his guilty plea in 1997, or mislead in that process by his attorney and court personnel, is beyond the scope of this appeal from the triasuch claim would need to have been brought as a direct appeal or habeas 5 petition; it cannot be raised as a basis for resentencing under proposition 47. disposition the order is affirmed. keeny, j.* we concur: zelon, acting p. j. segal, j. *judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
