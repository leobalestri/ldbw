(a)). the court denied the petition on december 18, 2014, stating that beckwith was ineligible for resentencing as he was serving a life sentence for first degree burglary, and his sentence for petty theft had been stayed. beckwith filed this timely appeal. beckwith argues, and respondent agrees, that he is eligible to have his section 666, subdivision (a) petty theft conviction reduced to a misdemeanor under proposition 47, despite his life sentence for burglary and his stayed sentence for petty theft. proposition 47, enacted by the voters in november 2014, added sectioa person currently serving a sentence for a conviction . . . of a felony . . . who would have been guilty of a misdemeanor under the act . . . had this act been in effect at the time of the offense may petition for a recall of sentence . . . to request resentencing in accordance with . . . section . . . 666 of the penal code, as th[at] section[] ha[s] been amended or ( 1170.18, subd.
