(stats. 2006, ch. 69,  27, eff. july 12, 2006; stats. 1995, ch. 91,  121; people v. voit (2011) 200 cal.app.4th 1353, 1372; people v. valenzuela (2009) 172 cal.app.4th 1246, 1248.) we agree. count 1, alleged the sexual abuse of one child took place from on or between january 1, 2001, and june 5, 2003. count 9 alleged continuous sexual abuse of a second child from on or between may 3, 2003, and may 2, 2006. thus, only a $200, not a $300 section 290.3, subdivision (a) sex offender fine should be imposed. in addition, defendant argues ex post facto principles prohibit imposition of penalties which took effect after he committed the offenses. (see people v. voit, supra, 200 cal.app.4th at pp. 1374-1375; people v. batman (2008) 159 cal.app.4th 587, 591.) defendant cites as examples of this: government code sections 76000.5 (stats. 2006, ch. 841,  1, eff. jan. 1, 2007); 76104.6 (initiative measure, prop. 69,  iv.1, approved nov. 2, 2004, eff. nov. 3, 2004); and 76104.7 (stats. 2006, ch. 69, 18, eff. july 12, 2006.) defendant is correct that the penalties under government code sections 76000.5 and 76104.7 cannot be imposed on defendant under ex post facto laws. (people v. voit, supra, 200 cal.app.4th at p. 1374; people v. valenzuela, supra, 172 cal.app.4th at p. 1248.) however, we agree with the attorney general that defendant is subject to the deoxyribonucleic acid penalty under government code section 76104.6. this is because government code section 76104.6 was effective november 3, 2004. and, defendant pled guilty to continuous sexual abuse of two children in the time period from january 1, 2001, through may 2, 2006. the $200 sex offense fine is subject to the following penalties and assessments: a $200 state penalty ( 1464, subd. (a)(1)); a $140 county penalty (gov.code,  76000, 5 subd. (a)(1)); a $40 state surcharge ( 1465.7, subd. (a)); a $20 deoxyribonucleic acid penalty (gov. code,  76104.6, subd. (a)(1); and a $60 state court construction penalty (gov.code,  70372, subd. (a)(1).) (people v. castellanos (2009) 175 cal.app.4th 1524, 15281530; people v. mccoy (2007) 156 cal.app.4th 1246, 1254.) the total fine is $660. however, the $200 sex offense fine has an ability to pay provision. therefore, the fine must be reversed for the trial court to determine whether the defendant has the ability to pay a fine totaling $660. (see people v. castellanos, supra, 175 cal.app.4th at pp. 1528-1530; people v. mccoy, supra, 156 cal.app.4th at pp. 1254-1257; people v. taylor (2004) 118 cal.app.4th 454, 456-457.) after the ability to pay determination is made, the trial court is free to reimpose the fine. we also requested the parties to address the issue of whether defendant is entitled to two additional days of presentence credit. defendant received 1,010 days of presentence credit consisting of 879 days of actual custody credit and 131 days of conduct credit. the probation report states defendant was arrested on february 13, 2009. defendant was sentenced on july 12, 2011. because defendant is entitled to credit for the date of his arrest, there are a total of 880 days between his arrest date and the sentence date. (people v. smith (1989) 211 cal.app.3d 523, 526-527.) pursuant to penal code section 2933.1, subdivision (b), conduct credit is awarded at the rate of 15 percent, which is 132 days. the total amount of custody credit is 1,012 days. the judgment must be modified to reflect 880 days of presentence custody plus 132 days of conduct credit for a total of 1,012 days. 6 iv. disposition the judgment is reversed insofar as it imposed a $300 penal code section 290.3, subdivision (a) sex offense fine. upon remittitur issuance, the trial court is to consider whether defendant has the ability to pay a $200 sex offense fine plus the applicable penalties and surcharge. the judgment is modified to reflect credit for 880 days of presentence credit rather than 879 days, plus 132 days of conduct credit for a total offense fine, the superior court clerk is to prepare a correct amended abstract of judgment and deliver a copy to the department of corrections and rehabilitation. the judgment is affirmed in all other respects. not to be published in the official reports turner, p. j. we concur: mosk, j. kriegler, j.
