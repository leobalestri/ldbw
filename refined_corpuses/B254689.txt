(super. ct. l.a. county (no. na097138).) (pen. code,  1170, subd.

(super. ct. l.a. county (no. na089854).) appellant contends: (1) the trial court abused its discretion by removing appellant from the courtroom during trial without adequate justification, thereby violating ts and ; (2) the rights, ma; (3) the cumulative effect of the erroneous shackling and courtroom removal requires reversal; (4) the trial court abused its discretion in failing to substitute counsel for appellant, thereby violating s constitutional rights and mandating the trial court erred in sentencing appellant to county jail for 23 years 8 months rather than imposing a split sentence under the terms of realignment;

at booking appellant did not indicate any distinct rocks which would facilitate sales to multiple people; dappeared to be conducting drug transactions with other people; appellant sold drugs to carter on two occasions;

(people v. marsden (1970) 2 cal.3d 118.) 8 appellant was already seated in the witness box when the jury entered, but after he testified, the trial court invited him to sit with his lawyer again. at the end of the trial the court instructed the jury with caljic no. 1.04.5 b. the absence of evidence establishing a manifest need or adequate justification for physical restraints renders the decision to allow appellant to appear before the jury in shackles an abuse of discretion and violation of the present record fails to demonstrate eithe ints removed constituted an abuse of discretion court has broad power to maintain courtroom security and [citation], and its decisions on these matters are reviewed for abuse of discretion.

(duran(people v. gamache, supra, 48 cal.4th at p. 367.) and whatever method the court determines to be necessary must be reasonably likely to achieve the desired result. (see e.g., people v. soukomlane (2008) 162 cal.app.4th 214, 230 [requisite showing of adequate justification or manifest need for physical restraints absent behavior consisted only of emotional outbursts during trial].) although no formal hearing is required, the record must show the court based its determination on decision to use visible restraints without evidence in the record establishing a threat of violence, escape, or nonconforming conduct constitutes an abuse of discretion. (duran, supra, 16 cal.3d at p. 291; people v. stevens, supra, 47 , we consider whether the trial court constitutional rights afforded the defendant. (people v. stevens, supra, 47 cal.4th at p. 643.) and we look to see that the trial court made the findings necessary to impose a particular security measurethat there was a manifest need, and that the measure chosen 10 was the least obtrusive that would still be effectiveand further whether those findings people v. gamache, supra, 48 cal.4th at p. 368.) our supreme court has identified numerous cases where a manifest need for physical restraints had been demonstrated: people v. kimball (1936) 5 cal.2d 608, 611 [defendant expressed intent to escape, threatened to kill witnesses, secreted lead pipe in courtroom]; people v. burwell (1955) 44 cal.2d 16, 33 [defendant had written letters stating that he intended to procure a weapon and escape from the courtroom with the aid of friends]; . . . ; people v. hillery (1967) 65 cal.2d 795, 806 [defendant had resisted being brought to court, refused to dress for court, and had to be taken bodily from prison to court]; people v. burnett (1967) 251 cal.app.2d 651, 655 [evidence of escape attempt]; people v. stabler (1962) 202 cal.app.2d 862, 863863 [defendant attempted to escape from county jail while awaiting trial on other escape charges]; people v. loomis (1938) 27 cal.app.2d 236, 239 [defendant repeatedly shouted obscenities in the courtroom, kicked at the counsel table, fought with the officers, and threw himself on the floor].) (people v. mar (2002) 28 cal.4th 1201, 12161217 (mar); duran, supra, 16 cal.3d at p. 291.) as the foregoing cases illustrate, the justification offered by the trial court in this caseappelfailed to demonstrate any air trial. to the contrary, the imposition of physical restraints here appears unrelated to any legitimate security concerns, but was instead a further punishment for outbursts during trial for which appellant had already been removed from the courtroom. while the factors a court may consider in determining whether imposition of restraints is defendant, no case has upheld the use of shackles for a defendant who has merely had verbal outbursts or shown (see people v. 11 soukomlane, supra, 162 cal.app.4th at p. 230; see also people v. cox, supra, 53 cal.3d at p. 651 [a manifest need for restraints may be based on nonconforming conduct . . . which . . . would disrupt the judicial process if unrestrained, italics added].) to be sure, the court had authority to take measures to address and prevent gs. administration of criminal justice that dignity, order, and decorum be the hallmarks of all court proceedings in our country. the flagrant disregard in the courtroom of elementary standards of proper conduct should not illinois v. allen (1970) 397 u.s. 337, 343 [90 s.ct. 1057].) the trial court thus clearly acted within its discretion in removing appellant from the courtroom after warning him that it would do so if he continued to interrupt the proceedings. but it abused that discretion and violated due process when it imposed visible restraints without balancing the need for heightened by substantial evidence that such measures were necessary. (people v. stevens, supra, 47 cal.4th at p. 643; people v. gamache, supra, 48 cal.4th at p. 368.) prejudicial effect, due process does not permit the use of visible restraints if the trial court hadeck, supra, 544 u.s. at p. 632.) we are not unmindful of courtroom attacks, or the need to give trial courts latitude in making individualized security determinations. (deck, supra, 544 u.s. at p. 632.) indeed, the supreme court ibid.) but the present casedisruptive behavior, is not one of them. 12 c. the error cannot be deemed harmless and requires reversal of respondent contends that appellant cannot establish prejudice because the trial court properly instructed the jury not to consider the shackles for any reason, and the evidence of his guilt was overwhelming. we disagree. shackling a defendant in the presence of the jury has long been deemed an inherently prejudicial practice, which conveys to the jury that the defendant must be separated from the community at large because he is especially dangerous or culpable, or is the cause of some official concern or alarm. (deck, supra, 544 u.s. at p. 635; holbrook v. flynn (1986) 475 u.s. 560, 569 [106 s.ct. 1340]; people v. stevens, supra, 47 cal.4th at pp. 643644.) as the majority in deck visible shackling undermines the presumption of innocence and the related fairness of the factfinding deck, supra, 544 u.s. at p. 630; mcdaniel, supra, 159 cal.app.4th at p. 746.) ou(duran, supraorders the defendant to wear shackles that will be seen by the jury, the defendant need not demonstrate actual prejudice to make out a due process violation. the state must prove to (deck, supra, 544 u.s. at p. 635; chapman v. california (1967) 386 u.s. 18, 24 [87 s.ct. 824]; mcdaniel, supra, 159 cal.app.4th at p. 745.) after reviewing the entire record in this case, we cannot conclude with confidence was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. although the audio and video evidence, in support of counts 1 and 2 was , n count 3, possession for sale, was not. 13 entire defense was that he was a heavy user of crack cocaine, and the cocaine found in his possession was for his personal use. he testified that he had smoked cocaine with the police informant before the events of this case, and on the day of his arrest, he had obtained the cocaine in his possession from carter. but by appearing before the jury to testify in shackles, appellantmoreover, the shackles branded appellant as a dangerous person, suggesting that he was guilty of something even more serious than the charges reflected. and the litany of prior drug convictions with attendant prison terms only served to exacerbate the image of appellant as a dangerous felon unworthy of any credence. on this point as well. when a defendant appears before the jury in visible restraints, the trial court has a sua sponte obmar, supra, 28 cal.4th at p. 1217, quoting duran, supra, 16 cal.3d at pp. 291292.) as a general rule, an appellate court may presume the jury followed such an admonition. (people v. delgado (1993) 5 cal.4th 312, 331; people v. mickey (1991) 54 cal.3d 612, 689, fn. 17.) however, where, as here, the court admonished the jury only after the defendant had testified, the jury was free to focus on his shackles, speculate on the possible reasons for their imposition, and allow that distraction to taint his credibility as well as the entire defense. reasonable to presume that jurors can follow an admonition to disregard shackles that is given at the at the beginning of trial, before they have heard any evidence, we question whether it is reasonable to presume that jurors can and will follow such an admonition when it is given after the defendant has testified and they have already had a chance to react to and draw negative mcdaniel, supra, 159 cal.app.4th at p. 747.) in words the united states supreme court 14 butterworth v. smith (1990) 494 u.s. 624, 630 [110 s.ct. 1376].) with ld be used as a last resort not only because of the something of an affront to the very dignity and decorum of judicial proceedings that the judge is seeking to u 6 (people v. soukomlane, supra, 162 cal.app.4th at p. 231.) in sum, respondent has failed to convince us that requiring appellant to testify in shackles without any showing of manifest need or adequate justification did not contribudiscretion was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. accordingly, we reverse the judgment. 6 mcdaniel also warned of the constitutional pitfalls of presuming that a jury the failure to make a determination that shackling is necessary. if such an admonition trial courts could shackle prison inmates as a matter of routine, knowing that a subsequent admonition and appellate presumption would in most cases render any abuse of discretion harmless. as noted, however, routine shackling without an individualized justification is contrary to the procedures outlined by the united states and california supreme courts. moreover, a blanket application of the presumption could, as an unintended consequs sua sponte obligation to make a determination on the record that shackling is reasonably necessary.(mcdaniel, supra, 159 cal.app.4th at p. 747, fn. 9.) 15 disposition the judgment is reversed (no. na097138), and the sentence in the probation violation matter is vacated (no. na089854). not to be published. lui, j. we concur: chaney, acting p. j. johnson, j.
