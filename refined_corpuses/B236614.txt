filed 10/16/12 p. v. wishum ca2/5 not to be published in the official reports california rules of court, rule 8.1115(a), prohibits courts and parties from citing or relying on opinions not certified for publication or ordered published, except as specified by rule 8.1115(b). this opinion has not been certified for publication or ordered published for purposes of rule 8.1115. in the court of appeal of the state of california second appellate district division five the people, plaintiff and respondent, v. melvin wishum, jr., defendant and appellant. b236614 (los angeles county super. ct. no. na089258) appeal from a judgment of the superior court of los angeles county, arthur jean, judge. affirmed. lynne s. coffin, under appointment by the court of appeal, for defendant and appellant. kamala d. harris, attorney general, dane r. gillette, chief assistant attorney general, lance e. winters, assistant attorney general, chung l. mar and erika d. jackson, deputy attorneys general, for plaintiff and respondent. _______________________________ 2 defendant and appellant melvin wishum, jr., was found guilty by a jury of sale of marijuana in violation of health and safety code section 11360, subdivision (a). the trial court found that defendant had served a prior prison term as defined in penal code section 667.5, subdivision (b).1 defendant was sentenced to state prison for four years, consisting of the midterm of three years for the charged offense and one year for the prior prison term. defendant argues in this timely appeal that the trial court erred in refusing to grant his motion for a continuance in order to retain counsel of choice, a structural error requiring reversal. defendant further argues the equal protection clauses of the federal and state constitutions require that he receive the benefit of the realignment of the new statute. we reject both arguments and affirm. facts because the sufficiency of the evidence is not challenged on appeal and no evidentiary issues are raised, we briefly state the facts in the light most favorable to the judgment. ron earley works for the long beach police department, buying drugs. he is paid $60 when he makes a purchase, and $20 when he is unsuccessful. on june 16, 2011, earley was working under the supervision of detective aldo decarvalho. he was searched for money and drugs, and then provided $20 to purchase drugs from a group of individuals, including defendant. using street vernacular, earley asked to purchase $20 of marijuana. defendant left the group and returned with a white bag containing marijuana. officers in the area saw varying portions of the transaction. defendant was taken into custody by patrol officers. earley identified defendant in a field showup of suspects. the $20 bill used for the purchase was not recovered on defendant or others detained with him, nor did he possess any marijuana. 1 statutory references are to the penal code except where otherwise indicated. 3 discussion denial of motion to continue the trial the jury was being summoned to the courtroom. defendant argues the denial of a continuance for the purpose of retained private counsel constituted structural error requiring reversal. a. background defendant appeared in the trial court on august 19, 2011.2 the public defender declared a conflict of interest, and the alternate public defender was appointed. a motion pursuant to pitchess v. superior court (1974) 11 cal.3d 531 was granted on that date, subject to an in camera hearing set for august 26. the trial date of september 22 following the in camera hearing on the pitchess motion on august 26, the trial court ordered disclosure of one report with respect to one officer, with compliance on august 30. on september 22, the date of trial, defendant personally addressed the trial court, my mother and father were going to help me get a lawyer and my brother passed away. and that kind of slowed things down. right now, things are not looking in my favor. i going to go to trial today. this is an easy case. you win, you lose, it is not a difficult case. [] you have a fine lawyer here. you have a fine p 2 all relevant dates are in 2011, unless otherwise stated. 4 -enter a plea, the court offered to put off sentencing until after october 1, which would result in a two- the next day or two, it is a prison sentence and yo l was denied. after discussion, defense counsel informed the trial court that defendant would like to accept the proposed case settlement. the trial court began taking the plea, answering several questions for defendant in the process. when asked how he plead, defendant was thereafter convicted by a jury. b. standard of review and relevant law the trial court has broad discretion on matters of continuances and reversal is appropriate only where denial of a continuance is arbitrary and unreasonable. (people v. alexander (2010) 49 cal.4th 846, 934-people v. superior court (brim) (2011) 193 cal.app.4th 989, 992.) continue any hearing in a criminal proceeding, including the trial, (1) a written notice shall be filed and served on all parties to the proceeding at least two court days before the hearing sought to be continued, together with affidavits or declarations detailing specific facts showing that a contid.subdivision (b), a party may make a motion for a continuance without complying with the 5 id., continuance without complying with the requirements of subdivision (b), the court shall hold a hearing on whether there is good cause for the failure to comply with those requirements. at the conclusion of the hearing, the court shall make a finding whether good cause has been shown and, if it finds that there is good cause, shall state on the record the facts proved that justify its finding. a statement of the finding and a statement of facts proved shall be entered in the minutes. if the moving party is unable to show good cause for the failure to give notice, the motion for continuance shall not be id., cause. neither the convenience of the parties nor a stipulation of the parties is in and of id., subd. (e).) c. analysis the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to continue. the motion was made on the day of trial, without the notice required by section 1050, subdivision (b). no good cause was presented for the delay in making the motion. a jury panel had been summoned to the court at the time of the request to continue. defendant made no attempt to demonstrate that any diligence had been exercised in seeking private counsel. the motion was open ended, with no particular date for either the retention of private counsel or readiness for trial. the court was not required, as a matter of law, to grant a continuance under these circumstances. (people v. blake (1980) 105 cal.app.3d 619, 624.) . . . however, he waited until the last minute to express these concerns. there is no evidence defendant attempted to retain counsel, or had even taken steps to secure funds to hire private counsel, although his problems with appointed counsel apparently began before november 2. under the 6 obtain counsel does not constitute an abuse of discretion or a denial of his sixth amendment right to counsel. (see people v. courts (1985) 37 cal.3d 784, 790(people v. pigage (2003) 112 cal.app.4th 1359, 1367-1368.) u.s. v. gonzalez-lopez (2006) 548 u.s. 140 (gonzalez-lopez) is misplaced. in gonzalez-lopez , the defendant retained counsel, joseph low, pro hac vice on the ground that low had violated a court rule during a hearing in a separate matter. the court took steps to prevent low from communicating with the defendant during trial, in which the id. at pp. 142-143, 146.) previously held that an element of this right is the right of a defendant who does not require appointed counsel to choose gonzalez-lopez, supra, 548 u.s. at p. 144.) the erroneous deprivation of the right to counsel of choice is structural error requiring reversal. (id. in balancing the right to counsel . . . against the demands of its calendar, morris v. slappy, 461 u.s. 1, 11id. at p. 152.) gonzalez-lopez is readily distinguished from the instant case, because defendant had no retained counsel. he did not suggest the name of potential counsel, nor did he indicate any effort had been made to locate counsel. the jury panel was on its way to the trial court. the difference between improperly removing retained counsel in gonzalez-lopez, and precluding communication with him, and what happened on the eve of 7 equal protection defendant was sentenced to state prison on september 23, 2011. effective for sentencing hearings taking place on or after october 1, 2011, the legislature enacted a sentencing plans at the county level. defendant contends he is entitled to the benefits of the new statute as a matter of equal protection of law. defendant argues the failure to apply the statute to him results in impermissible disparate treatment of two similarly situated groups of defendantsthose who were sentenced before and after the effective date of the statute. realizing the statute on its face applies prospectively, defendant limits his challenge to equal protection grounds. this issue was addressed by our colleagues in the fifth district in people v. cruz (2012) 207 cal.app.4th 664 (cruz(accord, people v. lynch (sept. 13, 2012, c068476) ___ cal.app.4th __ [2012 dar 12945] (lynch).) we agree with the analysis in cruz. related legislation, significantly changed the sentencing and supervision of persons convicted of felony offenses. the sentencing changes made by the act apply, by its code,  1170, subd. (h)(6).) the question raised on appeal is whether a defendant, who was sentenced before october 1, 2011, but whose conviction is not yet final on appeal, is section 1170. we conclude the answer is no. the sentencing changes made by the act apply only to persons sentenced on or after october 1, 2011, and such prospective-only cruz, supra, 207 cal.app.4th at p. 668, fns. omitted.) 8 the defendant in cruz violates his right to equal protection under the federal and state constitutions. by creating two classes of inmatesthose sentenced before october 1, 2011, whose sentences are served in state prison and who are subject to some form of parole, and those sentenced on or after october 1, 2011, whose sentences (or some portion thereof) are served in county jail and who are not subject to parolethe act, he says, treats two interest justifies thcruz, supra, 207 cal.app.4th at p. 674.) this contention is indistinguishable from that presented here by defendant. adopting the rational basis level of analysis of equal protection claims, as opposed to the strict scrutiny or important governmental interest tests, the cruz court found no equal protection violation in prospective application of the amended sentencing statutes. directly affein re stinnette [(1979)] 94 cal.app.3d [800,] 805, fn. 4; cf. scherling v. superior court (1978) 22 cal.3d 493, 502-503.) we do not believe he or she has a protectable interest in serving that sentence in county jail as opposed to state prison. (cf. meachum v. fano (1976) 427 u.s. 215, 225 [14th amend. liberty interest not implicated when prisoner transferred from one institution to another with more severe rules].) similarly, he or she has no fundamental interest in the possibility of a conditional early release via a hybrid sentence. (cf. greenholtz v. nebraska penal inamtes (1979) 442 u.s. 1, 7 [no constitutional or inherent right of convicted person to be conditionally released before expiration of valid sentence], abrogated on another ground as stated in wilkinson v. austin (2005) 545 u.s. 209, 229; people v. wilkinson [(2004)] 33 cal.4th [821,] 838 [defendant does not have fundamental interest in specific term of imprisonment]; people v. edwards [(1991)] 235 cal.app.3d [1700,] 1706 [equal protection challenges based on statutory ineligibility for diversion are 9 cruz, supra, 207 cal.app.4th at pp. 677-678.) offenders sentenced before, and those sentenced on or after, october 1, 2011, does not cruz, supra, 207 cal.app.4th at p. 680; lynch, supra, __ cal.app.4th at p. __ [2012 dar at pp. 12946-12947; see people v. brown (2012) 54 cal.4th 314, 328-330 [no equal protective violation in prospective application of statutory grant of additional conduct credits]; people v. floyd (2003) 31 cal.4th 179, 188-191 [prospective application of proposition 36, the substance abuse and crime preventions act of 2000, did not violate equal protection].) disposition the judgment is affirmed. kriegler, j. we concur: turner, p. j. armstrong, j.
