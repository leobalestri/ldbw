(a).) the evidence at trial established that appellant was involved in an ownership dispute regarding a duplex in which he was living. frederick nitowski, the owner, began proceedings to evict appellant. during these proceedings, appellant threatened that the apartment was not going to be worth anything when he was done. after obtaining an eviction order from the court, nitowski discovered that appellant had severely damaged a unit. at the time of trial, the damage to the premises was determined to be $71,329. the trial court suspended imposition of sentence and placed appellant on formal probation for five years under certain terms and conditions, including that he make restitution. the judgment was affirmed on appeal in b202964. at a later restitution hearing, the court ordered appellant to reimburse the victim in the amount of $ 94,547.48. that order was affirmed in b204594. a financial evaluator determined that appellant had the ability to pay $50 a month in restitution. in the proceeding from which the latest appeal arises, the probation department reported that rather than paying $50 a month, defendant was to order that he pay $20 a month. defendant filed a notice of appeal from the order modifying his probation. after review of t-appointed counsel filed an opening brief asking this court to review the record independently pursuant to people v. wende (1979) 25 cal.3d 436, 441. appellant filed a supplemental brief in which he contends that he cannot pay 3 arbitrary. we disagree. the record of the hearing shows that appellant receives $938 a month from s.s.i. and pays no rent. the financial evaluator concluded that he could afford to pay $50 a month. the trial court offered appellant the opportunity to be interviewed by the financial evaluator again if his situation had changed or a full hearing on his ability to pay. defendant represented that his situation had not changed. defendant contended that his cost of food and clothing did not permit him to contribute any more than a dollar to restitution. the court informed him that if that was his contention, he needed to present receipts to substantiate it. appellant said that he had no bills because he paid for everything month, the court ordered him to pay only $20 a month. as the court stated: reasoning was sound and was certainly not an abuse of discretion. we have examined the entire record and are satisfied that no arguable issues exist, and that appellant has, wende procedure and our review of the record, received adequate and effective appellate review of the judgment entered against him in this case.
