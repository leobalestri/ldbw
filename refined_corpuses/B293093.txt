(see discussion of case history in people v. harris (sept. 25, 2017, b281043) [nonpub. opn.].) the supreme court s petition for review on december 22, 1998. (ibid.) at the time appellant was sentenced, a trial court had no power to strike a firearm enhancement. (see people v. thomas (1992) 4 cal.4th 206, 213.) in october 2017, senate bill no. 620 (2017-2018 reg. sess.) (sb 620) was enacted; it became effective on january 1, 2018. (stats. 2017, ch. 682.) sb 620 gives a trial court discretion to strike a firearm enhancement under section 12022.5. ( 12022.5, subd. (c).) on september 4, 2018, appellant filed a request for resentencing, citing sb 620. the trial court denied the request, when the senate bill went into effect. appellant appealed. his appointed counsel filed a brief requesting that we independently review the record for error pursuant to people v. wende (1979) 25 cal.3d 436 (wende). we directed counsel to send the record and a 1all further statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise indicated. 3 copy of the brief to appellant, and notified appellant of his right to respond within 30 days. we have received no response. discussion we dismiss the appeal for two reasons. first, appellant is not entitled to wende review. appeal as a matter of right, the court of appeal must independently review the record if appointed counsel represents he or she has found no arguable issues. (conservatorship of ben c. (2007) 40 cal.4th 529, 535, citing anders v. california (1967) 386 u.s. 738; wende, supra, 25 cal.3d 436.) a (people v. serrano (2012) 211 cal.app.4th 496, 503; see also people v. kisling (2015) 239 cal.app.4th 288, 290.) as this is an appeal from a petition for resentencing, not a first appeal as a matter of right, appellant is not entitled to wende review. because neither appellant nor his counsel has raised any claims of error, we dismiss the appeal as abandoned. (see serrano, supra, 211 cal.app.4th at pp. 503-504; kisling, supra, 239 cal.app.4th at p. 292 & fn. 3.) second, appellant was convicted and sentenced in 1997, and the judgment has since does not apply to final judgments. (people v. johnson (2019) 32 cal.app.5th 938, 941.) under senate bill no. 620, the trial court lacked jurisdiction to (people v. fuimaono (2019) 32 cal.app.5th 132, 135; see also people v. hernandez (2019) 34 cal.app.5th 323, 326-327.) since the trial court lacked jurisdiction to grant the relief requested in motion, its order denying the motion did not affect his substantial rights and is not an appealable postjudgment order. ( 1237, subd. (b); 4 people v. turrin (2009) 176 cal.app.4th 1200, 1208; johnson, supra, 32 cal.app.5th at p. 941; hernandez, supra, 34 cal.app.5th at p. 326.) be dismissed.
