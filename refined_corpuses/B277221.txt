( 1170.126 subd. (e)(2), 667, subd. (e)(2)(c)(iii).) we affirm. factual and procedural background on october 15, 1999, police officers saw defendant riding a bicycle on the sidewalk and ordered him to stop. defendant pedaled faster and rode the bicycle southbound in northbound lanes of traffic. a car almost struck defendant, and he fell off the bicycle. defendant ran from the police. as he was running, defendant pulled a loaded revolver from his waistband. a police officer pointed a gun at defendant, again ordering him to stop. continuing to run from the police, defendant cocked his arm backwards and threw the loaded revolver. he then stopped running. the gun struck a concrete wall about 40 feet from defendant, and the cylinder popped open.2 on april 18, 2001, a jury convicted defendant of possession of a firearm by a felon. (former  12021, subd.

(young i). we take judicial notice of this opinion. (evid. code,  452, subd. (d)(1), 459.) 3 former section 12021, subdivision (a)(1) was repealed operative january 1, 2012, but its provisions were reenacted without substantive change as section 29800, subdivision (a)(1). (see people v. sanders (2002) 55 3 had suffered two prior convictions within the meaning of the three strikes law ( 667, subds. (b)-(i), 1170.12) and that he served a prior prison term ( 667.5, subd. (b)). defendant was sentenced to a prison term of 25 years to life. we affirmed the judgment of conviction in young i. on february 15, 2013, defendant filed his petition for recall and resentencing. on august 25, 2016, the trial court denied the petition. that discussion section 1170.126 was enacted as part of proposition 36, which became effective on november 7, 2012. (people v. johnson (2015) 61 cal.4th 674, 685.) serving third strike sentences may seek resentencing in accordance with the ncing if . . . [] . . . [t]he inmate is serving an indeterminate term of life imprisonment imposed pursuant to [the three strikes law] for a conviction of a felony or (e)(1).) like a defendant who is being sentenced under the new provisions, an inmate is disqualified from resentencing if any of the exceptions set forth in section 667, subdivision (e)(2)(c) and section 1170.12, subdivision (c)(2)(c) are present. ( 1170.1johnson, at p. 682.) the referenced offenses for which resentencing is not available include those in which was armed with a firearm or deadly weapon, or intended to cause great cal.4th 731, 743, fn. 12.) for convenience and brevity, we refer to former section 12021 throughout this opinion as section 12021. 4 ( 667, subd. (e)(2)(c)(iii), 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(c)(iii) (hereinafter referred to collectively as subdivision (iii)).) the trial court here found defendant statutorily ineligible for recall and resentencing because defendant was armed with a firearm during the commission of the underlying offense of being a felon in possession of a firearm. subdivision (iii) must attach to the current offense as an addition and not just render an inmate ineligible for resentencing are referred to with the phrase with the phrase defendant contends that if the statute were intended to exclude the offense of possession of a firearm by a felon, the offense would have been specifically enumerated. facilitates the commission opeople v. pitto (2008) 43 cal.4th 228, 239-240 (pitto); people v. bland (1995) 10 cal.4th 991,1001-1003 (bland).) thus, with respect to the crime of possession of a gun, defendant the very act of having the gun available which is (original 5 italics.) defendant recognizes that numerous appellate courts have rejected his arguments,4 but argues such cases were wrongly decided. we disagree. first, defendant incorrectly asserts that being armed with a firearm is an element of the offense of being a felon in possession of a firearm. section makes it a felony for a person previously convicted of a felony to own, purchase, receive, or have in his or her possession or under osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th judicially construed to mean having a firearm available for use, either offensively or defensively. (ibid.possessing a firearm does not id. at p. 1030.) for example, a felon is in possession of a firearm if the firearm is found at his residence, but if he is not home at the time, he is not armed because the firearm is not readily available to him. (ibid.) here, the record shows defendant was observed pulling a handgun from his waistband, making it available for offensive or defensive use. thus, dresentencing. 4 see people v. osuna (2014) 225 cal.app.4th 1020, 1030 (osuna) (when pulled over by police, defendant who was holding a handgun when he got out of the car was found to be armed with a firearm and ineligible for resentencing); people v. brimmer (2014) 230 cal.app.4th 782, 796-797 (defendant who was holding a shotgun while arguing with his girlfriend was found to be armed with a firearm and ineligible for resentencing); people v. elder (2014) 227 cal.app.4th 1308, 1317 (bedroom and found a gun on a shelf and another gun in a safe, defendant was found to be armed with a firearm and not eligible for resentencing); people v. white (2014) 223 cal.app.4th 512, 524-526 (when approached by police, defendant tossed a handgun and was held to be armed with a firearm and not eligible for resentencing). 6 second, the ng not only narrowly drawn categories of third strike offenders who committed particular, specified offenses or types of offenses, but also broadly inclusive categories of offenders who, during commission of their crimesand regardless of those crimes basic statutory elementsused a firearm, were armed with a firearm or deadly weapon, or intended to cause great bodily injury to another person. significantly, however, those categories, while broad, are not unlimited. voters easily could have expressly disqualified any defendant who committed a gun-related felony or who possessed a firearm, (people v. blakely (2014) 225 cal.app.4th 1042, 1055 (blakely).) the blakely court examined proposition 36 ballot materials expressly distinguished between dangerous criminals who were deserving of life sentences, and petty criminals (such as shoplifters and those convicted of simple drug possession) who posed little or no risk to the public and did not id. at pp. 1056-convicted of two or more serious and/or violent felonies in the past, and most recently had a firearm readily available for use, simply does not pose little or ineligible for resentencing under proposition 36. (blakely, at p. 1057.) consistent with this analysis, courts have rejected the argument that the arming must be separate offense. (see osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1032; see also people v. white (2016) 243 cal.app.4th 1354, 1362-1363; people v. hicks (2014) 231 cal.app.4th 275, 283-284; people v. brimmer, supra, 230 cal.app.4th at pp. 798-799; people v. elder, supra, 227 cal.app.4th at pp. 7 1312-1314; blakely, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at pp. 1051-1057; people v. white, supra, 223 cal.app.4th at pp. 524-527.) as explained in osuna, the phrase [h]aving a gun available does not further or aid in the commission of the (225 cal.app.4th at p.1032.) pitto and bland in support of his argument pitto nor bland examined subdivision (iii). rather, both cases analyzed the sentence enhancement under section 12022, which imposed an additional prison term pitto, supra, 43 cal.4th at pp. 239-240; bland, supra, 10 cal.4th at pp. 1001-1002.) as explained in blandying that the added penalty applies only if during facilitative nexusbland, at p. 1002, original italics.) this holding has no relevance here. 12021 does not, regardless of the facts of the (osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1032.) thus, because defendant was properly determined that defendant was ineligible for recall and resentencing under proposition 36. 8 disposition the order denying the petition for recall and resentencing is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. goodman, j.* we concur: ashmann-gerst, acting p.j. chavez, j. * retired judge of the los angeles superior court assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
