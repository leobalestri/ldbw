[he and dyranesia] had been together that day and . . . was she in . . . a robbery or something; and he was saying . . . t know nothing about it . . . . at the police station, ugwuzor was arrested. at some point, police found a black cloth in the center console of the green chevy. after ugwuzor and dyranesia were released, they met with cooper at a restaurant. cooper confronted ugwuzor with facts about the robbery, and ugwuzor did not deny anything. 4 a video retrieved from ugwuzor- and time-stamped january 16, 2013, at 10:19 p.m., was played for the jury. on the video, ugwuzor was heard saying to dyranesia and a second maleall right, stop right here. stop right here. stop right here. uh, wait[,] go up, yeah, stop right here.

(people v. uribe (2011) 199 cal.app.4th 836, 860.) i. relevant proceedings. in a pretrial colloquy, the prosecutor indicated either two juries or a severance was necessary under aranda/bruton. (people v. aranda (1965) 63 cal.2d 518 (aranda); bruton v. united states (1968) 391 u.s. 123 (bruton).) counsel for ugwuzor and dyranesia concurred. the trial court ordered a severance, and it indicated that ugwuzor would be tried first. subsequently, the prosecutor informed the trial court: i apprised [defense counsel] . . . that i[] spoke[] to [cooper] for the first time yesterday. . . . [cooper] mentioned . . . that . . . [] . . . [he met with ugwuzor] . . . at a restaurant where [he] confronted [ugwuzor] and basically accused him of putting his daughter in a very . . . untenable position [by] . . . committing these robberies and [said,] i know you did it, and you really need to stop doing this kind of thing[] and . . . straighten up your life. [] at which point [ugwuzor] . . . failed to deny any of those accusations and, in fact, told [cooper] that he was [going to] get his life together or go into the army. defense counsel objected that the evidence should be excluded because it constituted late discovery in violation of penal code section 1054. the trial court overruled the late discovery objection. on direct examination, the prosecutor established that cooper was present on january 17, 2013, when dyranesia was arrested. the police indicated that she had committed robbery. cooper was upset with ugwuzor, believing he was the last person to 6 be with dyranesia. as a result, cooper called ugwuzor to apprise him of the situation. he did not act surprised. cooper picked up ugwuzor and drove him to the police station. as they were driving, cooper asked what was going on, and whether she was in the robbery. ugwuzor claimed that he did not know anything about it. the prosecutor asked after . . . your daughter was arrested and you took . . . [ugwuzor] to . . . the police station, . . . did you have a private conversation with your daughter about her activities in the days and couple weeks preceding . . . the early the trial court interrupted and saidwait. excuse me. [] since we obviously onversation [] . . . relevance of the fact at sidebar, the pr going to elicit from [cooper]. he learned from his daughter what . . . she and [ugwuzor] had been doing . . . . and he learned from his daughter what they did on the night of january 16th. [] he confronted . . . [ugwuzor] with . . . that information[,] and . . . [ugwuzor] . . . failed to deny it. [cooper] even went as far as to . . . indicate that . . . when they were robbing this young man, . . . [ugwuzor] was putting his own life and the life of his daughter in danger because they only had a toy gun and you never know what someone else out there could have. [] . . . [ugwuzor] having a . . . toy gun, he did not deny having a gun[.] . . . and all he responded to in the face of these allegations was that he was [going to] get his life together and go into the army. the trial court okay. [] ask [cooper] about the conversation he had with [ugwuzor. . . anything about the conversation he had with his daughter, or that he learned from his daughter. . . . matter where he got the information. the only thing relevant is the conversation he had with [ugwuzor], and thing you can ask him about. cooper testified that he told ugwuzor that he him; but my daughter wanted us to still be 7 feelings for him. . . . [] i told them they could have got killed playing with a toy gun out there trying to rob people . . . . ugwuzor did not deny his involvement in any robberies. when cooper told ugwuzor ugwuzor during direct examination of cooper, the prosecutor asked, inter alia, the following questions. q: when you talked to the defendant, did you tell him that you knew he had been robbing people for the la defense counsel objected that the question was leading. the objection was sustained. q: and, in fact, when you told him that you [knew] what he had been doing, did you . . . tell him that you knew he had robbed a single person, or that you knew he had once again, the trial court sustained an objection that the question was leading. q: when you spoke with him about . . . the fact that you knew what he had been involved inon january 16th, did you confront him with the fact that during the course based on an objection from defense counsel, the trial court disallowed the question on the ground that it was leading. q: when you talked to him about the fact that you knew he had been involved in that robbery on january 16th, did you confront him with . . . some items that you knew he following this question, there was yet another objection on the ground of leading the witness. this time, the trial court overruled the objection. q: and when you confronted him about your knowledge that he had committed the january 16th, 2013, robbery, . . . did he deny commdefense counsel objected on the grounds that the question misstated the testimony and was compound. [t]he objection is sustained just [because] basically 8 on the grounds of the vagueness of the question about the confrontation. whatever it was that he specifically said when you confronted him is a conclu q: did you make a statement to the defendant about your knowledge of him being involved in a robbery on january 16 defense counsel objected that the question assumed facts not in evidence, and lacked foundation. these objections were overruled. in closing argument, the prosecutor summarized the facts stated by cooper when he was with ugwuzor at the restaurant. then the prosecutor said[cooper ] could only know that information if he was present at the robbery, or he received some information from somebody w ii. no misconduct; no constitutional violation. conduct qualifies as prosecutorial misconduct under state law when it involves the use of deceptive or reprehensible methods to attempt to persuade either the court people v. hill (1998) 17 cal.4th 800, 819.) a pattern of misconduct by a prosecutor violates the federal constitution only when the misconduct is so egregious that it infects the trial with such unfairness that the defendant is denied due process. (ibid.) a prosecutor is not permitted to ask questions that imply the existence of facts which he or she made no effort to prove and had no reason to believe could be proved. (people v. blackington (1985) 167 cal.app.3d 1216, 1221.) such questions violate a sixth amendment right to confrontation if the context of the questions have the impact of testimony and result in the defendant being denied his right to challenge the . (id. at p. 1222, citing douglas v. alabama (1965) 380 u.s. 415, 419420.) according to ugwuzor, the prosecutor committed misconduct because: (1) she knew she could not prove that cooper had knowledge of what transpired in the two weeks before the robbery and on january 16, 2013, and that the knowledge came from dyranesia; and (2) the questions implied dyranesia confessed to cooper. 9 we perceive no misconduct. the questions the prosecutor asked were permitted by the trial court. at no point did the prosecutor ask cooper the source of his information about the robbery. more importantly, people v. capistrano (2014 ) 59 cal.4th 830, 869870 (capistrano) h amendment right to confrontation was not violated. in capistrano, the jury heard that a witness had a conversation with someone who had been present at murder, and later asked the defendant whether it was true he had killed someone with a belt. in rejecting a sixth amendment challenge under aranda/bruton, the court stated: the testimony implied that [an] unknown person told [the witness] defendant killed someone with a belt. statements that incriminate by implication, however, are not within the scope of bruton. [citation.] moreover, the challenged testimony is reasonably viewed as explaining the basis for [the questions to defendant and to give context to his responses. introduction of testimony . . . pose[] a ss] right to confront the witnesses against him.accordingly, his rights were not violated.capistrano, supra, 59 cal.4th at p. 870.) we find no meaningful distinction between capistrano iii. no prejudice. the video captured from his phone, the text message from his phone soliciting another person to create an alibi the night of the robbery, and the big 5 video constitute overwhelming evidence of guilt. even if ugwuzor was denied due process, we conclude that any constitutional violation was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. (chapman v. california (1967) 386 u.s. 18, 24.) all other issues are moot. 10 disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. __________________________, j. ashmann-gerst we concur: _____________________________, p. j. boren ____________________________, j. chavez
