(smith v. robbins (2000) 528 u.s. 259, 277-284 [120 s.ct. 746, 145 l.ed.2d 756]; people v. kelly (2006) 40 cal.4th 106, 112-113; people v. wende (1979) 25 cal.3d 436, 441.) the record establishes quintal was adequately advised of the immigration consequences of her plea when she signed the plea form stating the conviction will have the consequences of deportation, exclusion from admission and denial of naturalization. (see people v. superior court (zamudio) (2000) 23 cal.4th 183, 207.) that the admonitions were communicated in writing rather than repeated orally is of no legal significance because the trial court confirmed quintal had read and understood the plea 2 quintal requested a certificate of probable cause, which was denied by the trial court. on february 14, 2013 an amended notice of appeal was filed on quintals behalf in which the pre-printed box was checked indicating her appeal was based on the sentence or other matters occurring after the plea that do not affect the validity of the plea. 4 form and had signed it willingly. (see arlena m. v. superior court (2004) 121 cal.app.4th 566, 570.) quintals remaining contentions cannot be addressed because they rely on matters outside the appellate record. nor are they relevant to whether quintal should have prevailed on her statutory motion to dismiss. the order is affirmed. perluss, p. j. we concur: zelon, j. segal, j.* * judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
