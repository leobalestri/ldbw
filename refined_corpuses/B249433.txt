( 12022.53, subds. (b), (c).) the trial court found that appellant had served two prior prison terms ( 667.5, subd. (b)). the trial court sentenced appellant to 97 years eight months to life in prison. appellant was ordered to pay a $40 court operations assessment ( 1465.8, subd. (a)(1)) and a $30 criminal conviction assessment (gov. code,  70373) for each count. the trial court also imposed a $5,000 restitution fine payable to the california victim compensation and government claims board ( 1202.4, subs.

(see  1465.8, subdivision (b); gov. code,  70373, subd. (b).) because section 1464 or government code section 76000 are not applicable to any of the fines imposed upon appellant, the $1,000 penalty assessment must be stricken from the judgment.4 3 (commencing with section 76000) of title 8 of the government code, and except as otherwise provided in this section, there shall be levied a state penalty in the amount of ten dollars ($10) for every ten dollars ($10), or part of ten dollars ($10), upon every fine, penalty, or forfeiture imposed and collected by the courts for all criminal offenses, . . . government coexcept as otherwise provided elsewhere in this section, in each county there shall be levied an additional penalty in the amount of seven dollars ($7) for every ten dollars ($10), or part of ten dollars ($10), upon every fine, penalty, or forfeiture imposed and collected by the courts for all criminal offenses, . . 4 we note that the $1,000 penalty assessment is not included in the abstract of judgment. it is, however, part of the oral pronouncement at sentencing and is included in the minute order. 4 disposition the $1,000 assessment and surcharge is stricken from the judgment. in all other respects, the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. __________________________, j. ashmann-gerst we concur: _____________________________, p. j. boren ______________________________, j.* ferns * judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
