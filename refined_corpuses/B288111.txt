(a)(1), now  29800, subd. (a)(1)) and ammunition (former  12316, subd. (b)(1), now  30305, subd. (a)(1)). the trial court found true the allegations bowdry previously suffered strike convictions of assault with a deadly weapon ( 245, subd. (a)(1)) and attempted first degree residential burglary ( 459, 664). it imposed a third strike sentence of 25 years to life ( 667, subds. (b)-(i), 1170.12). 1 all statutory references are to the penal code. 3 on december 14, 2012, bowdry filed a petition for recall of sentence and resentencing under proposition 36. he claimed possession of a firearm by a felon was no longer a serious or violent felony within the meaning of the three strikes law ( 667, subd. (d)(1), 1170.12, subd. (b)(1)), and neither of his prior serious or violent felony convictions was one which disqualified him from having his sentence recalled ( 1170.126, subd. (e)(3); see  667, subd. (e)(2)(c)(iv), 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(c)(iv)). the trial court issued an order to show cause why his sentence should not be recalled. the people filed opposition to the petition, arguing bowdry was ineligible for recall of sentence and resentencing because he was armed during the commission of the current offense ( 667, subd. (e)(2)(c)(iii), 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(c)(iii); see  1170.126, subd. (e)(2)). on petition, finding beyond a reasonable doubt that he was ineligible based on his being armed during the commission of the current offense. bowdry timely appealed. discussion a defendant is eligible for recall of sentence and resentencing under proposition 36 if (1) the current offense is not one defined as a serious or violent felony and is not specified in the three strikes law as a disqualifying conviction, and (2) the defendant has no prior disqualifying convictions. ( 1170.126, subd. (e).) disqualifying convictions include those in which, . . . offense, the defendant used a firearm, was armed with a firearm or deadly weapon, or intended 667, 4 subd. (e)(2)(c)(iii), 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(c)(iii); see  1170.126, subd. (e)(2).) bowdry argues that the armed exclusion from eligibility for resentencing does not apply to possession of a firearm by a felon. rather, it applies only where the arming is offense, such that the weapon facilitates the commission of that separate offense, and there is a facilitative nexus between the arming and the other offense. in making this argument, bowdry acknowledges that the courts of appeal have consistently held that the arming need not be tethered to another offense, and the armed exclusion requires only a temporal nexus, not a facilitative one. (see people v. cruz (2017) 15 cal.app.5th 1105, 1111-1112; people v. valdez (2017) 10 cal.app.5th 1338, 1356; people v. frutoz (2017) 8 cal.app.5th 171, 175-176, 177-178; people v. white (2016) 243 cal.app.4th 1354, 1363; people v. hicks (2014) 231 cal.app.4th 275, 283-284; people v. brimmer (2014) 230 cal.app.4th 782, 798-799; people v. elder (2014) 227 cal.app.4th 1308, 1312-1314; people v. osuna (2014) 225 cal.app.4th 1020, 1032; people v. white (2014) 223 cal.app.4th 512, 525; see also people v. piper (2018) 25 cal.app.5th 1007, 1015-1016.) moreover, the supreme court in people v. estrada (2017) 3 cal.5th 661 rejected the argument that there must be a offense for a defendant to be ineligible for resentencing under proposition 36. the court section 1170.12, subdivision (c)(2)(c)(iii) provides only one express nexus requirement between these general descriptive terms and the d]uring 5 suggests temporal overlap: something that occurs throughout the duration of an event or at some point in its course. (see, e.g., merriam-temporal connection between the excluding conduct and the such a nexus imposes certain limits on the applicability of the firearm-related exception, [proposition 36] could certainly have imposed an even stricter requirement for triggering the exception. (see people v. bland (1995) 10 cal.4th 991, 1002 . . . in the commissionfacilitative nexusnot do so, we may infer some kind of temporal limitation on the retroactive application of section 1170.12, subdivision estrada, supra, at p. 670, fn. omitted.) bowdry does not challenge the finding that he was armed with a firearm during the commission of the current offense, to the extent of a temporal nexus, not a facilitative one. (see people v. osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 102a]rmed with a mean having a firearm available for use, either offensively or ith respect to the crimes of possessing or carrying, a gun, the defendant is not also armed with it in the commission of those offenses within the 6 disposition the order is affirmed. not to be published johnson, acting p. j. we concur: bendix, j. currey, j.* * judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
