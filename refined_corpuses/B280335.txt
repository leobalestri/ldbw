(b); counts 1 and 2), and one count of resisting a peace officer ( 148, subd. (a)(1); count 3.) the jury also found true the allegations that defendant personally used a firearm in the commission of the 2 all undesignated statutory references are to the penal code. 4 attempted robberies. ( 12022.53, subd. (b).)3 defendant waived jury trial on the prior-conviction allegations and in a bifurcated trial, the court found defendant had suffered two prior strike convictions for serious or violent felonies ( 667, subds. (b)(i)), one prior serious felony ( 667, subd. (a)(1)), and one prior conviction for which he had served a prior prison term ( 667.5, subd. (b)). the prior strikes were for assault with a deadly weapon ( 245) and second degree robbery ( 211) convictions in, respectively, 2006 and 2005. after denying to dismiss his prior strikes under people v. superior court (romero) (1996) 13 cal.4th 497, the court sentenced him to an aggregate term of 25 years plus 50 years to life in state prison. for count 1, the court sentenced defendant to 15 years plus 25 years to lifea third-strike term of 25 years to life, plus 10 years for the firearm enhancement ( 12022.53, subd. (b)) and five years for the serious-felony prior ( 667, subd. (a)(1)). for count 2, the court sentenced defendant to 10 years plus 25 years to life, to run consecutivelya third-strike term of 25 years to life plus 10 years for the firearm enhancement ( 12022.53, subd. (b)). for count 3, the court sentenced defendant to 364 days in county jail to run concurrently with the sentence in count 1. the court 3 the jury found defendant not guilty of robbery (211; count 4), burglary ( 459; count 5), and assault by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury ( 245, subd. (a)(4); count 6). these offenses were allegedly committed on a different day and involved a different victim, ramon wright. 5 dismissed the section 667.5, subdivision (b) prior prison term enhancement. this timely appealed followed.4 contentions defendant contends the matter must be remanded for resentencing because the court was unaware of its discretion to dismiss the prior strike convictions as to one of the counts, the court abused its discretion by denying his romero motion, and senate bill no. 620 applies retroactively and vests sentencing courts with discretion to strike or dismiss firearm enhancements. discussion 1. the court did not abuse its discretion in denying romero motion. 1.1. standard of review when a prior felony conviction is alleged under the three strikes law, a trial court has discretion to dismiss it under section 1385. (romero, supra, 13 cal.4th at pp. 529530.) the courts discretion, however, is limited. (id. at p. 530.) [i]n ruling whether to strike or vacate a prior serious and/or violent felony conviction allegation or finding under the three strikes law, on its own motion, in furtherance of justice pursuant to penal code section 1385(a), or in reviewing such a ruling, the court in question must consider whether, in light of the nature and circumstances of his present felonies and prior serious and/or violent felony convictions, and the particulars of his background, 4 we deny defendants petition for a writ of habeas corpus in a separate order filed concurrently with this opinion. 6 character, and prospects, the defendant may be deemed outside the schemes spirit, in whole or in part, and hence should be treated as though he had not previously been convicted of one or more serious and/or violent felonies.(people v. williams (1998) 17 cal.4th 148, 161.) we review the trial courts decision whether to strike a previous serious or violent felony for abuse of discretion. (people v. carmony (2004) 33 cal.4th 367, 374.) [a] trial court will only abuse its discretion in failing to strike a prior felony conviction allegation in limited circumstances. for example, an abuse of discretion occurs where the trial court was not aware of its discretion to dismiss [citation], or where the court considered impermissible factors in declining to dismiss [citation]. (id. at p. 378.) 1.2. motion defendant contends the trial court was unaware of, or abused, its discretion to dismiss either or both of the prior strike allegations as to one count but not as to the other count under people v. garcia (1999) 20 cal.4th 490 (garcia). in garcia, the supreme court concluded trial courts have discretion under section 1385 to dismiss prior strike allegations under the three strikes law as to one count but not as to another count. (id. at pp. 503504.) the record does not support assertion that the court was unaware of its garcia discretion. although the court did not expressly refer to its discretion under garcia, we presume it was aware of that discretion absent evidence to the contrary. (people v. mosley (1997) 53 cal.app.4th 489, 496; people v. davis (1996) 50 cal.app.4th 168, 172 [where record is silent regarding trial courts purported misunderstanding of its  1385 discretion, appellants burden is not sustained].) significantly, 7 the court reviewed romero motion and that motion expressly cited garcia. romero motion emphasized that the court had the right to strike the prior strike allegations as to some counts but impose them as to another count. and the court noted that although it had the authority to prior strike convictions, not to exercise that discretion based on a number of factors. we also conclude the trial court did not err in denying romero motion in its entirety. the court considered s criminal history, the circumstances and seriousness of his current offenses, the fact that he committed his current offenses while on parole, and the particulars of backgroundincluding his documented history of mental illnessbefore denying the motion. as the courts analysis shows, is the kind of revolving-door career criminal for whom the three strikes law was devised.(people v. gaston (1999) 74 cal.app.4th 310, 320.) under these circumstances, the court acted well within its discretion in deciding that defendant did not fall outside the spirit of the three strikes law. 2. remand for a new sentencing hearing is necessary in light of senate bill 620. at the time it sentenced defendant, the trial court had no discretion to strike the firearm enhancements imposed under section 12022.53. (former  12022.53, subd. (h).) but senate bill 620, which took effect on january 1, 2018, court may, in the interest of justice pursuant to section 1385 and at the time of sentencing, strike or dismiss an enhancement subd. (h).) in their supplemental letter brief, the people concede senate bill 620 applies retroactively to defendants non-final 8 judgment but argue remand is unnecessary because the court would not have exercised its discretion to strike the firearm enhancements. (see people v. gutierrez (1996) 48 cal.app.4th 1894 [remand is unnecessary where the trial court makes clear that had it been aware of its discretion to strike the defendants prior convictions, it would not have done so].) here, a remand is proper because the record contains no clear indication of an intent by the trial court not to strike [the] firearm enhancements. although the court imposed a substantial sentence on [defendant], it expressed no intent to impose the maximum sentence. (people v. mcdaniels (2018) 22 cal.app.5th 420, 427428.) to the contrary, it imposed the sentence for count 3 concurrently with the sentence for count 1. thus, nothing in the record rules out the possibility that the court would exercise its discretion to strike the firearm enhancements under section 12022.53, which sentence. we express no opinion on how the court should exercise its discretion on remand, that discretion is for it to exercise in the mcdaniels, at p. 428.) 9 disposition sentence is vacated and the matter is remanded for the limited purpose of allowing the trial court to consider whether to strike the firearm enhancements imposed under section 12022.53. in all other respects, the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports lavin, j. we concur: edmon, p. j. egerton, j.
