therefore, the trial court erred when it allowed his preliminary hearing testimony to be read to the jury. in a related argument, defendant confrontation clause of the california constitution because it was not reliable. a. relevant procedural background on september 9, 2014, at the preliminary hearing, ibrahim testified about how defendant robbed him. on september 23, 2014, the matter was set for trial on november 18, 2014. on november 18, 2014, the matter was called and trailed to november 20, 2014. at defendanthe case was continued to december 2, 2014. following a break in the voir dire proceedings on december 2, 2014, the prosecutor advised the trial court that during the break, he had been informed from his him was in jordan and would not return until sometime in january. the prosecutor requested, subject to a determination of due his unavailability. the following day, los angeles county district attorney investigator joe flannagan (flannagan) testified at the due diligence hearing. he stated that he had been 6 address; the business was closed and empty, and it appeared that there was no business there. he spoke with the clerk of a nearby store; that clerk said tha flannagan testified that he then went to ibrahon the door. when no one answered, he left his business card at the front door, asking ibrahim to contact him. approximately one hour later, flannagan received a telephone call from a woman with a middle eastern accent. she said that she was calling in response to the business card he had left at her door. the woman said that ibrahim was her husband, that he was in jordan because his father was seriously ill, and that he would not return for about two months. flannagan did not do anything else to locate ibrahim. marized the relevant history, noting the dates of the offense, arraignment, preliminary hearing, original trial, and continued trial. the trial court then invited argument from counsel. defense counsel argued that the people failed to exercise due diligeunavailability. the trial court that no one suggested that ibrahim was anywhere other than jordan. the trial court also found no reason to believe that the people intentionally planned to use the preliminary jury. b. relevant law defendant has the right, guaranteed by the confrontation clauses of people v. herrera (2010) 49 cal.4th 613, 620 (herrera).) important, the constitutional right of confrontation is not absolute.

(ibid.) people v. cromer (2001) 24 cal.4th 889, 901.) c. analysis defendant contends that the trial court erred because ibrahim was not unavailable. we disagree. the people presented considerable evidence concerning their efforts to locate ibrahim, including visiting his business address, speaking with the clerk of a neighboring business, visiting his home, and speaking with a woman who identified 8 searching for ibrahim on november 7, 2014, well before the start of trial. (herrera, supra, 49 cal.4th at p. 622.) in urging reversal, defendant argues that the district attorney should have taken additional steps to procure ibrahim at trial; he points out that the prosecution did not attempt to determine ibrnot obtain contact information for ibrahim in jordan. however, even if other avenues could have been pursof inquiry pursued does not affect [the determination of due diligence]. [citation.] it is people v. cummings (1993) 4 cal.4th 1233, 1298.) as set forth above, they did. being in jordan.4 he asserts that the prosecution could have at least asked ibrahim to return to the united states. but, as set forth above, just because the prosecution could have taken additional steps to produce ibrahim at trial does not mean that it did not exercise due diligence. because it was unreliable. he claims that ibrahim did not have mastery of the english language; therefore, pursuant to people v. johnson (1975) 46 cal.app.3d 701 (johnson), the fhis difficulty understanding english, and (2) defense counsel failed to raise this objection below (people v. abel (2012) 53 cal.4th 891, 924 [failing to make a timely evidentiary 4 relying upon people v. sandoval (2001) 87 cal.app.4th 1425, 1443 (sandoval), defendant argues that the prosecution and the court could have done more. sandoval is readily distinguishable. in conducting its reasonableness analysis, the sandoval court noted sandoval, supra, at p. 1438.) defendant does not direct us to a similar agreement between the united states and jordan. 9 objection forfeits the argument on appeal], johnson is inapplicable. in johnson, the testimony of a spanish-speaking witness that was admitted at trial after the witness was shown to be unavailable. (johnson, supra, at p. 703.) the trial court refused to admit the preliminary hearing. (id. at p. 704.) the court of appeal held that the trial court erred in rejecting the proffered impeachment evidence since it may have revealed inaccuracies in the translation. (id. at pp. 704705.) here, in contrast, ibrahim testified at the preliminary hearing in english. and, nothing in johnson suggests that this testimony cannot be reliable by virtue of language. have been admitted at trial because his defense counsel failed to make basic evidentiary objections and opted not to cross-long as a defendant was provided the opportunity for cross-examination, the admission of preliminary hearing testimony under evidence code section 1291 does not offend the confrontation clause of the federal constitution simply because the defendant did not conduct a particular form of cross-examination that in hindsight might have been more effectivepeople v. carter (2005) 36 cal.4th 1114, 11731174.) in a similar veinpreliminary hearing was the functional equivalent of not having legal counsel. as such, no reasonable argument can be made that the preliminary hearing is a reliable form of we explore the actual cross-testimony. we decline his request. unlike the circumstances in people v. valencia (2008) 43 cal.4th 268, 293a defendant from fully confronting the witness who later became unavailable to testify at trial] and ohio v. roberts (1980) 448 u.s. 56, 73, fn. 12, overruled on other grounds in 10 crawford v. washington (2004) 541 u.s. 36, defendant had the full opportunity to cross-examine ibrahim at the preliminary hearing. absent evidence in the record as to why counsel acted in the manner challenged, wdecisions at that preliminary hearing. (people v. mendoza tello (1997) 15 cal.4th 264, 266267.) disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. _____________________________, acting p. j. ashmann-gerst we concur: ______________________________, j. chavez ______________________________, j. hoffstadt
