(u.s. const., 6th amend.; cal. const., art. 1,  15; people v. herrera (2010) 49 cal.4th 613, 620-621.) the right is not, however, absolute.

(evid. code,  1291, subd.

(see people v. almanza (2015) 233 cal.app.4th 990, 1002 [district attorney contemplated possible criminal prosecution of defense trial counsel].) as to prejudice, defendant relies on harris v. 5 follows. on august 10, 2012, mr. calabria was arraigned in case entry of judgment was deferred. on january 29, 2013, mr. calabria was arraigned in case no. ba407248, alleging forgery in violation of penal code section 476. on february 1, 2013, he was charged with a probation violation in case no. ba407248. on march 12, 2013, mr. calabria was convicted in case no. la071672. mr. calabria first appeared in this case on march 20, 2013. on april 3, 2013, a complaint was lodged against mr. calabria with the state bar. between march 2013 and august 28, 2013, the probation violation matter was continued multiple times including on july 24, 2013. defendant was tried on august 5, 6 and 7, 2013. on august 28, 2013, mr. calabria pled guilty in the forgery case. on september 5, 2013, he first appeared in charged with a probation violation. mr. halpern represented: he was in drug court, and he was violated in drug court, put back into custody, and the negative report remanded him they were suggesting he be taken out of drug court and put into alternative treatment programs. [] so during the pendency of the trial not only was he facing a probation violation, but he was actually with 18 superior court (2014) 225 cal.app.4th 1129 for the proposition prejudice is presumed. however, we rejected that argument in harris inapplicable in the post-trial conflict of interest context. we concluded defendant was required to demonstrate actual prejudice. (people v. conrad, supra, typed opn. at pp. 3-5; accord, people v. almanza, supra, 233 cal.app.4th at pp. 1003-1006.) 2. failure to maintain sobriety defendant argues mr. calabria stood moot when no substantial evidence mr. calabria was under the influence of prejudicially affected his representation of defendant. deputy daren nigsarian testified for the defense at the june 8, 2015 new trial motion hearing. deputy nigsarian was than five feet from mr. calabria and defendant. deputy a little occasions, while witnesses were on the stand mr. calabria was writing on a yellow legal pad, his pen stopped moving, his eyes closed and his head dropped slowly towards the table until it was three inches from the surface. mr. calabria remained in that position with his eyes closed for five-minute stretches. deputy emeanor was consistent with unsteady. his voice was weak. his speech pattern was . . . 19 delayed, somewhat strung out. . . . [p]hysically he seemed extremely frail and as if he had a lack of while the trial was in progress, deputy nigsarian heard that mr. up as if he were waking up. deputy nigsarhim making objections from that state, and i remember him new trial motion hearing, mr. calabria admitted he was but he the foregoing evidence did not establish mr. calabria was moreover, there was no evidence any such drug use prejudiced it does appear, as discussed above, that mr. calabria had criminal charges pending against him during the trial and that at least some of those charges involved drug offenses. and deputy nigsarian did observe conduct he opined was consistent with being under the influence of narcotics. but deputy nigsarian also testified mr. calabria responded to what recall him making objections from that state, and i remember we have reviewed the record of the trial and do not find that mr. standard of reasonableness. we also do not find any prejudice to defendant. 20 3. failure to locate witness at the preliminary hearing, ms. garcia testified she was y; and then when i seen her again on thursday, we went at it again. i was mad because she had given me a purple eye, so i wanted to get her and run to the girl. so about the time [ronnie] got to go park the as noted above, ms. garcia was missing at the time of trial. during a due diligence hearing held after ms. garcia went missing, mr. barragan, the investigator ified he spoke to a woman thought mr. barragan was there to investigate a fight she had with ms. garcia at a food for less market sometime in may 2013on, mr. calabria testified he was aware of the woman but could not find her. he did not retain an investigator to look for her. mr. calabria further testified nothing in the discovery he received, including police reports, indicated the police had a witness who had been involved in a fight with ms. garcia. on appeal, defendant argues mr. calabria, who was present at the due diligence hearing, was ineffective for failing to interview this material, potentially exculpatory witness. 21 ms. garcia described two altercations with a girl or girls, one on tuesday, december 25, 2012, and the other on thursday, december 27, 2012. the woman who spoke to mr. barragan said she had a fight with ms. garcia in may 2013. the likelihood that these events were related was remote at best. moreover, ms. ms. garcia had been burned during the december 2012 or may 2013 fights with a girl or girls. further, the injuries deputy martin observed on december 28, 2012 appeared to be fresh and getting worse as the night progressed. defendant has not shown an outcome more favorable to him was reasonably probable had mr. calabria located and interviewed the unidentified woman. defendant has not established mr. calawith respect to his own criminal matters contributed to his failure to locate the woman. 4. failure to interpose objections defendant lists multiple points at which he contends mr. calabria should have objected and failed to do so. he lists these items in a cursory fashion, with only infrequent citation to the record, without developed argument, and with almost no citation to authority. for that reason, and consistent with established authority, we decline to address these claims.

(people v. williams (1997) 16 cal.4th 153, 215.) moreover, the record sheds no light on why mr. calabria chose to act or not to act in the challenged instances. (people v. michaels appropriately raised, if at all, in a habeas corpus proceeding. (people v. johnson (2016) 62 cal.4th 600, 653; people v. michaels, supra, 28 cal.4th at p. 526.) 5. evidence suppression motion defendant asserts he was prejudiced by mr. calabriafailure to file an evidence suppression motion based on the warrantless entry into the motel room. the failure to so move deprived defendant of the opportunity to adjudicate the admission in evidence of the items discovered there including the implements defendant used to torture ms. garcia, the loaded handguns, narcotics and drug paraphernalia. as discussed above, to establish ineffective assistance, a defendant must show both deficient performancethe representation fell below an objective standard of reasonablenessand prejudice.

(mincey v. arizona (1978) 437 u.s. 385, 392; people v. troyer, supra, 51 cal.4th at p. 605; people v. rogers, supra, 46 cal.4th at pp. 1156-1157articulable facswift action to prevent (people v. ray (1999) 21 cal.4th 464, 472; people v. duncan (1986) 42 cal.3d 91, 97.) here, the officers 26 acted on an anonymous tip that a young woman was being held against her will and was being beaten. the anonymous tip was knew there was a material consistency between the wetip information however, the motel manager told the officers the purported victim had been at the motel with defendant for two weeks and did not appear to be in distress or held against her will. we conclude a reasonable argument could be made, given the totality of the circumstances and the information known to the officers, that the warrantless motel room entry to protect an occupant was not objectively reasonable. (compare, people v. troyer, supra, 51 cal.4th at pp. 607-609; tamborino v. superior court (1986) 41 cal.3d 919, 921-925.) we further conclude the record supports the argument a more favorable outcome was reasonably probable had mr. calabria moved to suppress the incriminating evidence officers discovered in the motel room. (strickland v. washington, supra, 466 u.s. at p. 696; people v. carrasco (2014) 59 cal.4th 924, 982.) the arguably illegal entry evidence introduced at trial including implements defendant used to torture ms. garcia, loaded handguns, narcotics and drug paraphernalia. the tangible items seized substantially corroborated the case against defendant, particularly in light of 6 6 physical and testimonial evidence discovered . . . must be suppressed. defendant has not, however, analyzed the relevant 27 new trial hearing established he had no legitimate tactical reason for refraining from filing an evidence suppression motion. he thought such motion would be unsuccessful because the tip came would have explored filing a suppression motion had he known the tip was anonymous. on the record before us, we cannot say the suppression motion would have been deniedthat under the totality of the circumstances, an emergency situation existed sufficient to j entry into the motel room. in other words, given the opportunity, defendant may be able to prove his fourth amendment claim is meritorious, his probable the verdict would have been more favorable to him absent the seized evidence. on remand, the trial court is to consider this issue. if the trial court finds mr. calabria was not ineffective in failing to file such motion, or defendant suffered no prejudice, it shall reinstate its order denying defendant a new trial. if the trial court finds mr. calabria was ineffective and there is a reasonable probability of a different result had an evidence suppression motion been pursued, it shall issue an order granting defendant a new trial. law. (see, e.g., united states v. crews (1980) 445 u.s. 463; wong sun v. u.s. (1963) 371 u.s. 471; people v. teresinski (1982) 30 cal.3d 822.) application of the exclusionary rule to evidence other than the tangible items seized has not as yet been litigated in this case. 28 being prosecuted obligation to notify the trial court that mr. calabria faced an informed trial court could have taken steps to ensure defendant had conflict-free, drug-free counsel. as discussed above, however, there has been no showing the pending criminal resentation of defendant or that mr. calabria was under the influence of drugs. e. sentencing as noted above, the jury convicted defendant of torture, mayhem, corporal injury, methamphetamine possession, cocaine base for sale, firearm possession by a felon and ammunition possession. ( 206, 203, 273.5, subd. (a), 29800, subd. (a)(1), 30305, subd. (a)(1); health & saf. code,  11378, 11351.5.) the jury also found true firearm, deadly weapon, and great bodily injury infliction allegations. ( 12022, subds. (b)(1), (c), 12022.5, subd. (a), 12022.7, subd. (e), 12022.53, subd. (b).) defendant admitted prior conviction and prison term allegations. ( 667, subds. (a)(1), (b)-(i), 1170.12; health & saf. code,  11370.2, subd. (a).) the trial court sentenced defendant to two life terms plus twenty years. 29 we asked the parties to brief several sentencing issues. the trial court erred when it imposed two life terms for torture under sections 667, subdivisions (b) through (i), and 1170.12. the trial court should have doubled the minimum 7-year term for a 14-year-to-life sentence. (people v. jefferson (1999) 21 cal.4th 86, 96-100.) the trial court also erred in failing to impose, impose and stay, or strike multiple enhancements under sections 667, subdivision (a)(1), 667.5, subdivision (b), 12022, subdivisions (b)(1) and (c), 12022.5, subdivision (a), and 12022.7, subdivision (e). (people v. bradley (1998) 64 cal.app.4th 386, 391.) on remand, if the trial court again denies defendant a new trial, it shall resentence defendant as discussed above. 30 iv. disposition the judgment and order are conditionally reversed and the matter is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. not to be published in the official reports turner, p.j. we concur: kriegler, j. baker, j.
