(a)(1)) and sentenced under the three strikes law to an indeterminate term of 35 years to life. we affirmed his conviction in 2007. (people v. ross (may 10, 2007, b188587) [nonpub. opn.].) proposition 36 ( 1170.126) was passed in november 2012. appellant filed two petitions in 2012 for a writ of habeas corpus seeking recall of his third strike sentence under proposition 36 and dismissal of his strike prior convictions. ( 1285.) the court denied his requests. it found appellant ineligible for recall under proposition 36 because his current conviction for robbery was for a serious and/or violent felony and therefore he was statutorily excluded under the recall provisions. subsequently, appellant wrote two letters to the court asking the court to strike his prior strikes and sentence him to a term other than life under the three strikes law. neither letter is part of the record on appeal, but the court summarizes his requests in its memorandum opinion ruling on the requests, dated february 4, 2014. the court held there was no basis to reconsider appellants request for resentencing or to grant a postconviction romero motion. the court reiterated appellants conviction for a serious and/or violent felony disqualified him for resentencing under proposition 36. moreover, the court held it did not have authority to reconsider the sentencing courts ruling on appellants original romero motion, and besides, the sentencing court properly exercised 1 people v. romero (1996) 13 cal.4th 497 (romero). 2 further undesignated statutory references are to the penal code. 3its discretion to deny the romero motion in the first instance. appellant timely appealed from this february 4, 2014 denial order.3 discussion after counsel filed his wende brief, appellant was notified he could submit any contentions or issues that he wished us to consider. he did not file a supplemental brief. from our review of the entire record, we are satisfied counsel has fully complied with his responsibilities and no arguable issues exist. (people v. kelly (2006) 40 cal.4th 106, 123-124; wende, supra, 25 cal.3d at p. 441.) disposition the judgment is affirmed. flier, j. we concur: rubin, acting p. j. grimes, j. 3 to the extent the court construed appellants letters as a petition for recall of sentence, we note the appellate courts have reached conflicting conclusions on whether an order denying this type of petition is appealable, and the issue is currently under review by the california supreme court in teal v. superior court (2013) 217 cal.app.4th 308, review granted july 31, 2013, s211708, and in re martinez (2014) 223 cal.app.4th 610, review granted may 14, 2014, s216922. we need not decide this threshold issue and add to the debate. even if the order is not appealable, we could review the order by writ petition.
