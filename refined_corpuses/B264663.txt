(a)),1 and (2) possessing a controlled substance for sale ( 11378). the people further alleged that defendant had served five prior prison terms. (pen. code,  667.5, subd. (b).) a jury convicted defendant of both counts, and found true the allegations regarding all of the prior prison terms. 1 all further statutory references are to the health and safety code unless otherwise indicated. 3 the trial court sentenced defendant to seven years in prison. the court imposed a sentence of seven years on the transportation for sale count, comprised of a midterm sentence of three years plus four one-year sentences for four of the prior prison terms. the court then imposed a two-year prison sentence on the possession for sale count, but stayed that sentence pursuant to penal code section 654. defendant timely appeals. discussion i. possession for sale as a lesser included offense defendant argues that we must vacate his conviction for possession for sale because it is a lesser included offense of transportation for sale and because a defendant cannot stand convicted of both crimes. we review this argument de novo.

(people v. rogers (1971) 5 cal.3d 129, 134 (rogers); people v. watterson (1991) 234 cal.app.3d 942, 947; people v. valerio (1970) 13 cal.app.3d 912, 921; people v. vasquez (1955) 135 5 cal.app.2d 446, 448; people v. watkins (1950) 96 cal.app.2d 74, 76-77.) those decisions rest on the possibility that a person can transport drugs that are in the of another. (rogers, at p. 134.) for example, a defendant agrees to drive a friend across town and knows the friend is carrying a locked briefcase filled with drugs to which the defendant does not have the combination. in that instance, the defendant is knowingly transporting the drugs for sale but is not in possession of the drugs because the defendant has neither physical possession of them nor people v. morante (1999) 20 cal.4th 403, 417 [possession may be actual, physical possession or constructive possession turning on item]; montero, supra, 155 cal.app.4th at pp. 1175-1176.) based on this logic, the court in people v. eagle (2016) 246 cal.app.4th 275, 279 (eagle) recently held that simple possession of methamphetamine is not a lesser included offense to the crime of transporting drugs for sale. eagles logic applies with equal force to the crime of possession for sale. defendant raises five objections to this logic. -2014 precedent outlined above. for support, he cites the following language contained in a felony must be in possession of drugs with the intent to sell.safety, coms. on assem. bill no. 721 (2013-2014 reg. sess.) apr. 15, 2013, p. 2.) we disagree. the 2014 amendment, as the legislative history makes plain, had a specific purposenamely, to overrule that portion of rogers and its progeny such as people v. emmal (1998) 68 cal.app.4th 1313, 1316 and people v. eastman (1993) 13 cal.app.4th 668, 676-677, holding that a defendant is guilty of transporting drugs even if he was only transporting drugs intended for his own personal use (and thus not for sale to others). (see assem. com. on public safety, coms. on assem. bill no. 721 (2013-2014 reg. sess.) apr. 15, 2013, pp. 2-3; see also sen. com. on public safety, coms. on assem. bill no. 721 (2013-2014 reg. sess.) june 10, 2013, pp. 4-5; accord, eagle, supra, 246 6 he amendment explicitly intended to criminalize the transportation of drugs for the purpose of sale and not the transportation of drugs for nonsales purposes such as personal use nothing in that purpose undermines s other holding that it is possible for a person to transport drugs without possessing them. and although the language in the committee report could be read to suggest that a person is guilty of transporting drugs only if he is also in possession of them, that suggestion is contrary to the decades of precedent cited above. had the legislature meant to overturn this precedent, it would have amended the statute to add a possession requirement. (accord, juan g. v. superior court (2012) 209 cal.app.4th 1480, 1494 -absent a clear statement or necessary implication].) the legislature did not so amend the statute, and we must give the statutory text the legislature did adopt dispositive weight because it is the statutes language which has been lobbied for, lobbied against, studied, proposed, drafted, restudied, redrafted, voted on in committee, amended, reamended, analyzed, reanalyzed, voted on by two houses of the legislature, sent to a conference committee, and, after perhaps more lobbying, debate and analysis, finally a scrutiny does not befall the committee reports . . . [citation.]friends of lagoon valley v. city of vacaville (2007) 154 cal.app.4th 807, 826-827.) second, and rment for transportation means that transportation and possession now both this observation is accurate, but unhelpful. what matters is not whether an offense and its necessarily included offense share one or more elements (as they always will). instead, what matters is whether it is possible to commit all elements of the greater offense without committing all elements of the lesser offense. here, it is. third, defendant cites language in several cases suggesting that possession is a lesser included offense of transportation when the possession is incidental to the transportation. (e.g., people v. kilborn (1970) 7 cal.app.3d 998, 1003; people v. 7 richardson (1970) 6 cal.app.3d 70, 78; people v. johnson (1970) 5 cal.app.3d 844, 847.) however, our supreme court in reed rule stated in thereed, supra, 38 cal.4th at p. 1228, fn. 2), and we agree. the focus of the inquiry into greater and lesser included offenses when both are charged is the elements of the offenses, not whether the two crimes happen to be incidental to one another in any given case. the overlap in any given case is addressed by penal code section 654 by staying multiple punishments for the same acts or acts incidental to one another; it does not require that one of the convictions be vacated. fourth, defendant hints that our analysis should be different because the judicially crafted exception to the general rule prohibiting convictions for a crime and necessarily included lesser offenses has constitutional moorings because it protects against violations of double jeopardy. we disagree. our supreme court has frankly admitted that the (pearson, supra, 42 cal.3d at p. 355.) although ostensibly raises some of the same concerns that underlie the protection against double jeopardy, the double jeopardy guarantee itself protects against a second prosecution for the same protects against a second prosecution for the same offense after convictionprotects against multiple punishments for the same (people v. sloan (2007) 42 cal.4th 110, 120-121, quoting brown v. ohio (1977) 432 u.s. 161, 165.) the first two are not implicated when a defendant only endures one prosecution, and the last is addressed by the bar against double punishment contained in penal code section 654. what is more, even if the judicially crafted exception to the general rule did have constitutional underpinnings, defendant has not articulated why that would alter how courts have been applying that exception for decades. lastly, defendant argues that it is impossible for a person to transport drugs for sale without, at a minimum, aiding and abetting the possession of those drugs for sale by whomever he is transporting, and therefore possession for sale is always a lesser included offense of transportation for sale. however, defendant waited until his reply brief on 8 appeal to present this argument, so it is not properly before us. (people v. rangel (2016) 62 cal.4th 1192, 1218-be entertained because of the unfairness it is without merit in any event. a person aids and abets unlawful purpose, (2) he, by his act or advice, aids, promotes, encourages or instigates crime. (people v. mccoy (2001) 25 cal.4th 1111, 1118; people v. prettyman (1996) 14 cal.4th 248, 259; people v. beeman (1984) 35 cal.3d 547, 561.) as these elements because a defendant who drives another person exclusively possessing drugs to a drug deal does not necessarily aid, promote, encourage or instigate possession, the defendant is not, by virtue of transporting that person alone, guilty of possessing the drugs on an aiding and abetting theory. ii. mistrial defendant also contends that both of his convictions must be overturned because narcotics expert gave testimony that, although stricken by the trial court, was so prejudicial that it required a mistrial even though defendant did not ask the court for one. a. pertinent facts in its rebuttal case, the people called a second narcotics expert who opined that defendant possessed the 9.997 grams of methamphetamine for sale and not for personal use. on cross-examination, defense counsel had the following colloquy with the witness: q: did you do any follow-up investigation in this case? a: yes, sir. q: what did you do? a: the main thing that i [did] is i listened to jail phone calls . . . [] [defendant] actually bonded out very quickly and di9 but he waswould come up oftentimes, and phone calls from people that were in custody, different gang members and narcotics . . . -[witness]inflammatory comments in front of the jury. the court refused to admonish the witness the court nevertheless sustained the objection, and instructesregard the answer at the close of trial, the court also gave the standard instruction providing that stricken from the record, you must disregard it and not consider tha b. analysis as a threshold matter, defendant forfeited the argument that the trial court erred in not granting a mistrial because he never asked for one. (people v. chatman (2006) 38 the court should have granted may trigger a mistrial . . . incurable by admonition or people v. franklin (2016) 248 cal.app.4th 938, 955, quoting people v. collins (2010) 49 cal.4th 175, 198; people v. ledesma (2006) 39 cal.4th 641, 683.) curative instruction to disregard improper testimony is sufficient to protect a defendant from the injury of such testimony, and, ordinarily, we people v. navarrete (2010) 181 cal.app.4th 828, 834; accord, people v. allen (1978) 77 cal.app.3d 924, 934-935 [it on to strike improper testimony and instruct the jury to disregard that testimony instead of declaring a mistrial for an abuse of discretion. (people v. clark (2011) 52 cal.4th 856, 990.) 10 in which the trial court abused its discretion in choosing to strike evidence rather than grant a mistrial. the expert testified would come up oftentimesho, because defense counsel cut off the witness by objecting). there was no evidence of the capacity member. what is more, the court twice admonished the jury to disregard the testimony, and we generally presume that jurors obey such instructions. (people v. jackson (2016) 1 cal.5th 269, 352.) defendant responds that (1) gang evidence is different, and once mentioned, it tion, and (2) people v. bentley (1955) 131 cal.app.2d 687, 690-691, overruled on other grounds by people v. white (1958) 50 cal.2d 428, and people v. hill (1998) 17 cal.4th 800, 845-846 dictate reversal. we disagree with both arguments. as explained above, the witness did not indicate defendant was a gang member; the witness said name came up in jailhouse calls among gang members. the connection to gangs is fleeting, tangential, and not of a type that an admonition is powerless to cure. bentley and hill involved far more egregious acts of witness misconduct than was present here: in bentley, a prosecution witness during direct examination offered that the defendant on trial for child molestation had previously been investigated for child molestation (bentley, at pp. 690-691); in hill, trial (hill, at p. 844). 11 disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. ______________________, j. hoffstadt we concur: _________________________, p. j. boren _________________________, j. ashmann-gerst
