(a), 664),1 and found true that a principal in the commission of the crime personally and intentionally discharged a firearm, and proximately caused great bodily injury to another. ( 12022.53, subds. (d) & (e).) the jury also found that the crime was committed for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with a criminal street gang with the specific intent to promote, further, and assist in criminal conduct by gang members. ( 186.22, subd. (b)(1).) in january 2007, the court sentenced defendant to 40 years to life in prison, consisting of: (1) life in prison with the possibility of parole for attempted willful, deliberate, and premeditated murder ( 664); (2) a minimum of 15 years in prison before defendant could be eligible for parole, based upon the gang enhancement statute ( 186.22, subd. (b)(5)); and (3) a consecutive term of 25 years to life for the firearm enhancement ( 12022.53, subd. (d)). defendant appealed, but did not raise any issue concerning his sentence. in september 2008, we affirmed the conviction in an unpublished decision. (people v. jones (sept. 9, 2008, b197557) [nonpub. opn.].) seven years later, in october 2015, defendant, with the aid of counsel, filed a motion to correct an illegal sentence. defendant asserted that the sentencing court should have stayed the 15-year minimum parole eligibility requirement imposed under the gang enhancement statute. he relied on this people v. valenzuela (2011) 199 cal.app.4th 1214 1 all subsequent statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise indicated. 3 (valenzuela), which involved a similar sentencing scenario. in valenzuela, we held that when the court imposed the 25-years-to-life firearm enhancement under section 12022.53, subdivisions (d) and (e), and the defendant did not personally use or discharge a gun, the court should have stayed the 15-year minimum parole eligibility requirement under the gang enhancement. (valenzuela, supra, 199 cal.app.4th at p. 1238; see also people v. gonzalez (2010) 180 cal.app.4th 1420, 1424-1427 (gonzalez).) at the hearing on defen in february 2016, the court noted that defendant was not present in court him [in court] because the sentence will be actually reduced rather than asked the deputy district attorney to confirm that the people conceded the sentencing error, which she did. the court then resentenced defendant on the attempted murder count to a life term with minimum parole eligibility of 7 years, plus a consecutive 25-years-to-life term under section 12022.53, subdivisions (d) and (e).2 the court also stayed the 15-year minimum parole eligibility requirement under section 186.22, subdivision (b)(5). the total term is thus 32 years to life. defendant appealed. he attached to his notice of appeal a document asserting numerous contentions. 2 the minimum term of 7 years before parole eligibility is based upon section 3046, which provides: (a) an inmate imprisoned under a life sentence shall not be paroled until he or she has served the greater of the following: (1) a term of at least seven calendar years. (2) a term as established pursuant to any other law that establishes a minimum term or minimum period of confinement under a life sentence before eligibility for parole. (b) if two or more life sentences are ordered to run consecutively to each other pursuant to section 669, an inmate so imprisoned shall not be paroled until he or she has served the term specified in subdivision (a) on each of the life sentences that are ordered to run consecutively. 4 we appointed counsel to represent defendant. on august 22, 2016, counsel filed a brief pursuant to wende, supra, 25 cal.3d 436, raising no issues on appeal and requesting that we independently review the record to determine if the lower court committed any error. counsel provided a declaration stating that she sent a copy of her brief and copies of the record on appeal to defendant and informed him of his right to file a supplemental brief and to request that the court relieve her as his attorney. on october 24, 2016, defendant filed a supplemental brief. we address the contentions he raised in the attachment to his notice of appeal and his supplemental brief. discussion defendant asserts he was denied his federal due process right to be present at the hearing on the motion to correct his sentence. under the federal constitutionthe ful[l]ness of his opportunity to defend against the charge. . . . [t]he presence of a defendant is a condition of due process to the extent that a fair and just hearing would be thwarted by his absence, and (u.s. v. gagnon (1985) 470 u.s. 522, 526; see also kentucky v. stincer (1987) stage of the criminal proceeding that is critical to its outcome if his presence would contribute to the fairness of people v. waidla (2000) 22 cal.4th 690, 742.) here, the relevant proceeding was a uncontested motion to correct his sentence. there were no witnesses or argument. after confirming that the people conceded the sentencing error, the court granted all the relief defendant requested. under these circumstances, defendantabsence from the proceeding did not thwart a fair and just hearing, and there is no showing that his presence would have contributed to the fairness of the procedure. we therefore reject this argument. next, defendant contends that his appellate counsel was ineffective for section 12022.53, subdivisions (d) and (e)(1). when the firearm enhancement 5 under section 12022.53, subdivision (e)(1) is alleged, he argues, the requirements of section 12022.53 and section 186.22 must be pleaded and proved. he is correct: section 12022.53, subdivision (e)(1), makes the enhancement described in that section applicable when it has been pleaded and proved that: (1) the defendant violated section 186.22, subdivision (b); t specified in (b).) there was no error, however, because these allegations were alleged in the information and the jury found them true. defendant might be arguing that his former appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to raise in the 2007 appeal the sentencing error that was eventually corrected in 2016. even if this claim is cognizable in this constitutionally deficient for failing to raise the sentencing issue in the first appeal, defendant is not entitled to relief. if his counsel had raised the issue in 2007, the best result he could have obtained is the reduction of his sentence from 40 years to life to 32 years to lifethe result he has now achieved. (cf. people v. speight (2014) 227 cal.app.4th 1229, 1249 [when counsel was ineffective at sentencing hearing, remedy is to remand for resentencing].) any claim of ineffectiveness is therefore moot. defendant next argues that the gun enhancement under subdivision (d) ordinarily, he explains, a gun enhancement under section 12022.53, subdivision (d) applies only to a defendant who personally used or discharged a firearm. he is correct. (see gonzalez, supra, 180 cal.app.4th at p. 1424.) the argument, however, ignores subdivision (e) of that statute, which, when the requirements of that subdivision are met, expands the enhancement to a principal in the commission of an offense.( 12022.53, subd. (econcerned in the commission of a crime, . . . whether they directly commit the 31.) even if he was merely the driver for the shooter, he was nevertheless 6 the commission of a crime.he was thus a principal in the crime and, therefore, subject to the enhancement under section 12022.53, subdivision (e). defendant makes a similar argument in his supplemental brief under his .there, he cites to people v. montes (2003) 31 cal.4th 350.3 montes held that the 15 year minimum eligibility requirement under the gang enhancement statute applies only if the defendant commits a felony that, by its own terms, provides for a life sentence. (id. at p. 352.) montes does not affect the now-stayed 15-year conviction, which provides for a life sentence section 664. defendant further contends that the striking of the gang enhancement (capitalization omitted.) the court, however, did not strike the gang enhancement; it merely stayed the enhancement that would have been operative in the absence of the longer gun enhancement. ( 12022.53, subd. (e)(2); valenzuela, supra, 199 cal.app.4th at p. 1238.) the stay of the gang enhancement penalty does not render the gun enhancement illegal. defendant further contends that because the gang enhancement was d] and stricken from the record(capitalization omitted), as stated above, the court did not strike the gang enhancement. more importantly, the staying of the gang enhancement penalty is unrelated to in his supplemental brief, defendant argues that the evidence was insufficient to estaquad clique of the grape street crips subsets are part of the larger grape stree (capitalization omitted.) the argument challenges the sufficiency of the ement. this issue 3 defendant requests that we take judicial notice of the montes decision. because we can consider the montes decision without taking judicial notice of it, we decline the request. 7 was reviewable on appeal from the conviction and cannot be raised in this appeal from the order correcting the sentence. (cf. people v. lynn (1978) 87 cal.app.3d 591, 593.) even if cognizable in this appeal, defendant has failed to provide an adequate record to evaluate the claim. (see people v. akins (2005) 128 cal.app.4th 1376, 1385 [appellant has the burden to provide an adequate record to permit review of a claimed error].) lastly, defendant contends that there was no evidence that he knew of this argument, like the preceding argument, is a collateral attack on the judgment and unreviewable in this appeal. moreover, the people were not required to prove such knowledge in order to establish the gang scienter element of the enhancement requires only the specific intent to promote, further, or assist in any criminal conduct by gang members.people v. albillar (2010) 51 cal.4th 47, 51.) in addition to considering specific contentions, we have reviewed fully complied with her responsibilities and that no arguable appellate issue exists. (wende, supra, 25 cal.3d at pp. 439-442; kelly, supra, 40 cal.4th at p. 110.) 8 disposition the order appealed from is affirmed. not to be published. rothschild, p. j. we concur: chaney, j. lui, j.
