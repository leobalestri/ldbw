(tiffani) back in 2011, when tiffani was just 16 years old. they dated and lived together for two or three years. after they broke up, tiffani and the son she had with another man twice moved in with defendant: she lived with defendant and other roommates for seven months in 2013, and with defendant and others for a few months in early 2014. during these times tiffani lived with defendant, he told her he needed money and encouraged her to be a prostitute for him. he instructed her on her pepper spray to protect herself; he drove her to the locales where men trolled for prostitutes; and he bailed her out of jail when she was eventually arrested for prostitution in 2014. tattooed on her body. tiffani always contributed all or some of her earnings to pay the expenses of the household she shared with defendant and the others. 1 all further statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise indicated. 3 the people charged defendant with several crimes, including pimping tiffani for three months in early 2014 ( 266h, subd. (a)). the people further alleged that he did so at the direction of, for the benefit of, or in association with a criminal street gang ( 186.22, subd. (b)(1)(a)). a jury convicted defendant of the pimping count, but found the gang allegation not true. defendant was acquitted of every other charged crime.2 the trial court imposed a prison sentence of three years. defendant filed this timely appeal. discussion in this appeal, defendant argues that (1) there is insufficient evidence to support his conviction for pimping, and (2) the pimping statute is unconstitutional as applied to him. because our resolution of the first issue may obviate the need to reach the second, constitutional issue (e.g., people v. moran (2016) 1 cal.5th 398, 401-402, fn. 2 [courts should avoid reaching constitutional questions unless necessary]), we turn first to the sufficiency question. i. sufficiency of the evidence -, , tion for people v. mcnulty (1988) 202 2 the people charged defendant with (1) human trafficking of a minor for a sex act ( 236.1, subd. (c)(1)) regarding a second woman; (2) pimping a minor 16 years or older ( 266h, subd. (b)(1)) regarding tiffani in 2011 and 2012; (3) pimping ( 266h, subd. (a)) regarding tiffani in 2012 and 2013; (4) dissuading a witness ( 136.1, subd. (b)(2)); (5) assault with a firearm ( 245, subd. (a)(2)); (6) pimping a minor 16 years or under ( 266h, subd. (b)(2)) regarding a third woman; (7) pandering a minor 16 years or under ( 266i, subd. (b)(2)) regarding the third woman; and (8) oral copulation of a person 16 years or under ( 288a, subd. (b)(2)) regarding the third woman. the people further alleged that the first four crimes were gang related ( 186.22, subd. (b)(1)(a)) and that defendant personally used a firearm during the assault ( 12022.5, subds. (a) & (d)). the trial court acquitted defendant of the witness dissuasion count at the close of evidence, and the jury acquitted him of the remainder. 4 cal.app.3d 624, 630.) to convict a defendant under the second prong at issue here, the people must prove[d] [his] support or maintenance in (2) the defendant knew the person was a prostitute, and (3) the defendant knew the earnings or proceeds used for his support or maintenance came from prostitution. ( 266h, subd. (a); people v. tipton (1954) 124 cal.app.2d 213, 217-218 (tipton); people v. simpson (1926) 79 cal.app. 555, 559.) in evaluating the sufficiency of the evidence underlying a conviction, we ask only whether there was enough credible evidence of solid value for a rational jury to find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. (people v. shamblin (2015) 236 cal.app.4th 1, 9.) we do so while viewing the record includes drawing all reasonable inferences and resolving all credibility determinations in favor of that verdict. (people v. prunty (2015) 62 cal.4th 59, 89.) pimping. tiffani testified that, in early 2014, defendant charged her $250 per month for household expenses, that he knew she was working as a prostitute, and that he knew that the money she paid him came from her income as a prostitute. indeed, defendant himself admitted to all of these facts when he took the stand at trial. defendant levels three specific challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence. first, he asserts that he cannot be guilty of pimping because, at most, he lived off of her prostitution income but was not involved in her prostitution business. this argument confuses the crime of pimping by deriving support with the crime of pandering. pandering involves the active procurement, encouragement or inducement of a person to engage in prostitution with the ( 266i, subd. (a); people v. zambia (2011) 51 cal.4th 965, 980.) pimping by deriving support is a general intent crime and does not require any active involvement in the prostitution. (people v. gibson (2001) 90 cal.app.4th 371, 386.) defendant goes on to suggest that the reduced intent requirement for pimping by deriving support renders it an impermissible strict liability crime 5 (in re jorge m. (2000) 23 cal.4th 866, 879 [noting general prohibition set forth in section 20 against crimes having no mens rea requirement but carrying substantial penalties]), but his argument ignores that this type of pimping has two knowledge requirements that preclude its classification as a strict liability crime (people v. rubalcava (2000) 23 cal.4th 322, 331-332). pimping by deriving support, defendant was defendant protests that he denied any involvement when he testified, but tiffani testified to the contrary and, in evaluating the sufficiency of the evidence, we must resolve this conflict in the evidencelike all othersin the light most favorable to the guilty verdict. (people v. mccurdy (2014) 59 cal.4th 1063, 1086.) second, defendant argues that in 2014 he had a job at autozone and lived in government subsidized housingmonthly contribution to make ends meet. however, such necessity is not a requirement, and its absence is consequently not a defense. the statute itself in part, italics added.) that the pimp has income from other sources is of no concern. (people v. coronado (1949) 90 cal.app.2d 762, the accused person, under the circumstances mentioned in the statute, he would be guilty of pimping regardless of his wealth, possessions or legitimate people v. courtney (1959) 176 cal.app.2d 731, 739-740 [gainful employment is not a defense to pimping].) the anti-pimping statute was meant to reach opulent violatorsimpecunious ones.people v. kennedy (1962) 200 cal.app.2d 814, 817.) household expenses. this fact does not exonerate him; to the contrary, it is an element of the offense necessary to convict him. ii. substantive due process challenge the federal constitution provides that n]o state person of life, liberty, or property, onst., art. xiv,  1; see also cal. const., art. i,  7, subd. [a] person may not be 6 deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of lawprocess not only guarantees that certain, minimum procedural safeguards will be followed before a person is deprived of life, liberty or property (mathews v. eldridge (1976) 424 u.s. 319, 334-335), but also has a substantive component that places certain deprivations beyond the power of the state to effectregardless of the procedural safeguards that are providedabsent a sufficiently compelling justification (reno v. flores (1993) 507 u.s. 292, 301-302). in examining whether a particular statute violates this substantive due process guarantee, we must ask four questions. first, what right or interest is the challenger asserting? (in re lira (2014) 58 cal.4th 573, 585 [s]careful descriptionasserted fundamental .) second, is that right or interest (united states v. salerno (1987) 481 u.s. 739, 751, quoting snyder v. massachusetts (1934) 291 u.s. 97, 105.) third, does the statute interfere with or infringe upon that right or interest? (washington v. glucksberg (1997) 521 u.s. 702, 720 (glucksberg); in re lira, at p. 585.) fourth, and if the answer to the third question is yes, does the statute pass the appropriate level of constitutional scrutiny? if a narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interestin re taylor (2015) 60 cal.4th 1019, 1036 (in re taylor).) if no fundamental right or interest is at stake, we simply inquire: legitimate government interestsglucksberg, at p. 728; people v. alexander (2010) 49 cal.4th 846, 892.) we independently review constitutional questions. (in re taylor, at p. 1035.) with respect to the first step of this analysis, defendant is asserting a liberty interest or right to cohabitate (and to share the expenses of cohabitation) with a former girlfriend and her child with another man. because defendant is challenging the anti-pimping statute as it applies to him, our whether in [these] particular circumstances the application [of the anti-pimping statute] deprived the 7 individual to whom it was applied of a protected rightin re taylor, supra, 60 cal.4th at p. 1039, citing broadrick v. oklahoma (1973) 413 u.s. 601, 615-616, italics in original.) -applied challenge is without merit because he cannot establish any of the remaining steps necessary to establish a constitutional violation. the rights and interests ranked as fundamental under substantive casey, supra, 505 u.s. at p. 849.) these decisions include whom to marry (obergefell v. hodges (2015) 135 s.ct. 2584, 2598; loving v. virginia (1967) 388 u.s. 1, 11-12); whether to have non-commercial, consensual sex (lawrence v. texas (2003) 539 u.s. 558, 567, 573-574 (lawrence)); whether to use contraceptives (griswold v. connecticut (1965) 381 u.s. 479, 485-486; see also eisenstadt v. baird (1972) 405 u.s. 438, 453 [extending right, via equal protection analysis, to unmarried couples]); whether to procreate (skinner v. oklahoma (1942) 316 u.s. 535, 541); whether to terminate a pregnancy (roe v. wade (1973) 410 u.s. 113, 164; casey, apierce v. society of sisters (1925) 268 u.s. 510, 535; meyer v. nebraska (1923) 262 u.s. 390, 399). courts are naturally reluctant to recognize new fundamental rights or interests, and for good reason: thguidepostsscarce and open-ended(albright v. oliver (1994) 510 u.s. 266, 271-272), and such a great extent[] place[s] the matter outside the arena of public debate and glucksberg, supra, 521 u.s. at p. 720). although defendant purports to assert a right or interest in having a -familial relationship[] he is at bottom asserting a right to have a former lover as a roommate. although the to biological relationships (smith v. organization of foster families (1977) 431 u.s. 816, 843-how right or interest also concerns the financial arrangement among cohabitants, 8 and such arrangements are rarely fundamental. (see lawrence, supra, 539 u.s. at pp. 575-577; grant, supra, 195 cal.app.4th at pp. 112-113.) even if we assumed that the right or interest defendant asserts is fundamental, the anti-pimping statute does not infringe upon or interfere with that right or interest because it merely prohibits a person from knowingly using to support a household. as long as a person does not use earnings from prostitution to support and maintain himself, the statute places no limits whatsoever on a right to cohabitate with a prostitute (or her children). in this respect, the anti-pimping statute is indistinguishable from the injunction at issue in people v. englebrecht (2001) 88 cal.app.4th 1236. there, the court upheld an anti-gang injunction that prohibited gang members from congregating within a specific geographical area. (id. at pp. 1262-1263.) although the injunction interfered with the right of family members who all belonged to a gang to associate with one another, this interference was not unconstitutional because the injunction any ibid.) the anti-similarly avoidable and hence not unconstitutional. what is more, because the anti-compersonal interest[s]grant, supra, 195 cal.app.4th at p. 113, quoting people v. mason (colo. 1982) 642 p.2d 8, 12-13, italics added.) the anti-pimping statute is also rationally related to a legitimate public interest, which is the pertinent test to apply when a statute does not infringe upon or interfere with a fundamental right or interest. (glucksberg, supra, 521 u.s. at p. 728.) for over a century, california has criminalized the act of pimping because criminalizing the act of knowingly deriving support from augmenting and expanding , or increasing the supply of available people v. hashimoto (1976) 54 cal.app.3d 862, 867.) in so doing, it discourages the exploitation of those persons who would become prostitutes. (people v. jeffers (198[p]imping and pandering involve the corruption of othersgrant, 9 these are quintessentially legitimate purposes that the anti-pimping statute undeniably serves. (grant, supra, 195 cal.app.4th at p. 117.) defendant raises three objections to this reasoning. first, he argues that this reasoning renders the anti-pimping statute unconstitutionally vague because it criminalizes both the cohabitating pimp who nefariously as well as the pimp who altruistically does so. this is true, but also irrelevant. motive is what distinguishes the two pimps defendant posits, but motive is not an element of pimping by deriving support. the actual elements of that crimenamely, that a person . . . prostituteare plainly spelled out in the statute itself. ( uncertain as to the conduct it prohibits, it is not vague. (chicago v. morales (1999) 527 u.s. 41, 56, quoting giaccio v. pennsylvania (1966) 382 u.s. 399, 402-403.) second, defendant contends that even if his conduct may be prosecuted, the anti-pimping statute prohibits other constitutionally protected conduct because it makes it a crime for a prostitute to use her earnings to buy goods or services from people who know of her vocation (because, in his view, such a groor for a prostitute to care for her minor children. as an initial matter, we doubt that the anti-pimping statute applies in either scenario. prior cases have held it does not. (people v. reitzke (1913) 21 cal.app. 740, 742-743 [statute does not apply to a person who enters into a business transaction with a prostitute to borrow money to open a saloon]; tipton, supra, 124 cal.app.2d at p. 218 [statute probably does not apply to a person selling food or clothing to a prostitute]; allen v. stratton (c.d.cal. 2006) 428 f.supp.2d 1064, 1072, fn. 7 reasonable . . . construction[] . . . support from [their] own performance of services earnings]; cf. tipton, at p. 218 [statute reaches person who sells drugs to a ose, intent and effect of inducprostitutirelevant only to a facial challenge to the statute, not to the as-applied 10 challenge defendant purports to be making. grant, as noted above, rejected a facial challenge to the anti-pimpiprovision (grant, supra, 195 cal.app.4th at pp. 111-117), and defendant provides us no reason to reject s thorough and sound analysis. lastly, defendant decries the anti-s ban on allowing a dickensianwhich, by prohibiting pimps from , hat feeds the conditions of prostitution and [es] the very problem it is to so stripped of its rhetoric and hyperbole, defendant is arguing that the anti-pimping statute is bad public policy. but that is a question reserved to our legislature; it is off limits to the courts, and provides no basis for relief here. disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. _______________________, j. hoffstadt we concur: _______________________, acting p. j. ashmann-gerst _______________________, j. chavez
