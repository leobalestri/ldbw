(b); counts 5 & 6). defendant pleaded guilty to the eight charged crimes pursuant to a negotiated open plea. as part of the negotiated open plea, defendant agreed to pay restitution ordered by the trial court. on november 20, 2015, the trial court denied probation and sentenced defendant to a total term of three years in prison. in addition, the parties stipulated that defendant owed $7,723 in restitution to usaa insurance. the trial court set a date for a victim restitution hearing, at which defendant waived his personal presence. at the august 19, 2016, restitution hearing, victim jeanne k. (jeanne) testified about her economic losses. the trial court ordered defendant to pay $68,318.88 in direct victim restitution. this timely appeal ensued. defendant contends that the fees ($32,847.50) and lost wages ($21,106.80). we affirm. 1 all further statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise indicated. 3 factual background a. the charged crimes defendant dated jeanne for about two years, from january 2012 to july 2014. while traveling together in italy, defendant ejected jeanne from their hotel room in the middle of the night and broke up with her. he thereafter engaged in menacing behavior against jeanne, including violent and threatening e-mails and voicemail messages, that culminated in defendant setting at some point, jeanne hired an attorney to help her obtain a restraining order against defendant. defendant was arrested for the charged crimes. while in jail, he telephoned his wife and encouraged her to call jeanne to will send her to hell.jeanne c---provoked b. victim restitution hearing before the restitution hearing, jeanne submitted a written victim restitution request that itemized her claimed losses and included copies of receipts and other verification of losses. as is relevant to his appeal, jeanne claimed $21,106.80 in lost wages, -traumatic stress due to arson, threats, dealing with possibility of [defendant] being released form jail, and not sentenced to serve media specialist at city of hope. in support, she attached two pay stubs from city of hope. 4 in addition, jeanne requested attorney fees in the amount of $50,065. the attorney fees related to obtaining temporary and permanent restraining orders for jeanne and her son against defendant ($36,847.50) and preparing for and attending the preliminary hearing in this case ($13,217.50). in support, jeanne attached a billing statement and invoice from blue capital law firm, as well as e-mails related to her payment of the attorney fees. at the hearing, jeanne testified that she hired an attorney to help her obtain a restraining order and help her through this criminal case. she had paid all of the attorney fees listed in the victim restitution request with the exception of $4,000. regarding her lost income, she explained that in july 2015, she had been working 50 hours a week at city of hope. however, she stopped working on september 16, 2015, after the district attorney informed her that defendant could receive probation in this case. she was emotionally distraught because of the possibility that defendant could be released from custody and not sent to prison. her emotional distress affected her job performance, caused her to miss work, and was the direct result of defendantlost wages requested by multiplying her monthly salary by three; the amount she requested did not include the freelance work that she could not complete during the relevant time, so the amount she was requesting was actually lower than the actual amount of uct. , reviewing the relevant case law, and entertaining oral argument, the trial court issued its order awarding jeanne restitution. regarding attorney fees, the trial court noted that the amount she paid to obtain a 5 restrain[w]retched, god-awful e-but, the trial court was not convinced that she was entitled to restitution for the fees that she incurred related to preparing and attending the preliminary hearing. thus, it awarded her $32,847 in attorney fees. as for lost wages, the trial court found that jeanne was tremendously trait awarded her $21,106.80. discussion defendant challenges those portions of the restitution award reimbursing jeanne attorney fees and lost wages.2 a. relevant law victim repeople v. giordano (2007) 42 cal.4th 644, 655; cal. const., art i,  28, subd.

(f)(3)(d), italics addeded by  1202.4, subd. (f)(3)(h)). the people have the burden of establishing the amount of restitution by a preponderance of the evidence. (people v. millard (2009) 175 cal.app.4th 7, 26.) once the people have made a defendant to establish that the loss is other than the amount claimed by the victim. (ibid.) discretion. (people v. millard, supra, 175 cal.app.4th at p. 26.) there is no abuse of discretion as long as the determination of economic loss is reasonable, producing a nonarbitrary result. (people v. giordano, supra, 42 cal.4th at p. 665.) b. analysis 1. attorney fees defendant first argues that section 1202.4, subdivision (f)(3)(h), limits the recovery of attorney fees to sums incurred to collect recoverable economic losses resulting from his criminal conduct; because the requested attorney fees do not fall within 7 this statutory language, defendant contends that the award of attorney fees was improper. we disagree. section 1202.4, subdivision (f)(3), expressly provides that the enumerated list, including subparagraph (h), is a nonexclusive list of examples of reimbursable enumerated losses, a trial court may compensate a victim for any economic loss which is proved to be the direct result of the specifically enumerated people v. keichler (2005) 129 cal.app.4th 1039, 1046; see also people v. crisler (2008) 165 cal.app.4th 1503, 1508 imitation the legislature placed on victim restitution conomic loss incurred as a result of the defendan.) as our supreme court has restitution for all crime victim losses, and the expressly nonexclusive list of categories of loss included in the direct restitution statute, we decline to read into that statute an implied limitation on restitution . . . based on a failure to people v. giordano, supra, 42 cal.4th at p. 660.) in light of the broad statutory language that includes a nonexhaustive list of items of restitution and interpretative case law, we conclude that where a victim incurs the economic loss of trial court may order restitution for that expense, regardless of whether the attorney fees were incurred as a cost of collection. urging reversal, defendant directs us to subdivision (f)(3)(h) of section 1202.4, which reasonable attorne 8 as a category of restitution. according to defendant, pursuant to people v. fulton (2003) 109 cal.app.4th 876 (fulton), the trial court was not permitted to award attorney fees not associated with collection costs. we disagree. as defendant correctly notes, the fulton court held that pursuant to section 1202.4, subdivision (f)(3)(h), result of the deferestitution, but they are limited to reasonable attorney fees incurred to collect restitution otherwise permitted under the fulton, supra, at pp. 884885.) defendant essentially construes this language as holding that any losses in the form of attorney fees are recoverable only as a cost of collecting restitution of other types of economic losses caused by his criminal conduct. like the trial court, we reject that reasonable interpretation to say it follows that we conclude that subparagraph (h) of section 1202.4, subdivision (f)(3), is applicable here.3 section 1202.4 contravenes the intent of that statute to 3 walker v. appellate division of superior court (2017) 14 cal.app.5th 651, 659, wherein tattorney fees incurred by the victim are recoverable as an item of restitution only to the extent that they were incurred in efforts to recover economic damages sustained by the victim as a result of nothing in this language precludes the restitution award here. jeanne incurred the economic loss of 9 compensate jeanne for any economic loss incurred as a result of not be applied to defeat legislative intent. (dyna-med, inc. v. fair employment & housing com. (1987) 43 cal.3d 1379, 1387, 13921393.) here, the trial court awarded jeanne attorney fees incurred to obtain a restraining order against defendant. although this economic loss is not expressly enumerated in threats and harassment. (people v. lyon (1996) 49 cal.app.4th 1521, 1525.) and may still be able to have the court in the civil-restraining-order case order [defendant] to pay her attorney a civil suit was unnecessary because section 1202.4, subdivision (a)(3)(b), the victim or victims, if any, in accordance with subdivision (f), which also  1202.4, subd. (i).) 2. lost wages defendant next argues that the restitution award for lost wages was improper because (1) it was not established that conduct and (2) because the court did not articulate a rational we disagree. t has suffered victims for every determined economic loss incurred as a result of 10 not distinguish between economic losses caused by physical people v. brasure (2008) 42 cal.4th 1037, 10741075.) wages or profits lost due to injury incurred by the victim,and it is likely that many injured crime victims will lose wages or profits for weeks, months, or possibly years following a people v. giordano, supra, 42 cal.4th at p. intent to limit the right to restitution for financial losses occurring within a particular time frame, or restitution to people v. phelps (1996) 41 cal.app.4tcalifornia constitution, article i, section 28, subdivision (b), must be construed broadly ans injuries, requiring restitution for all expenses necessary to treat those injuries, people v. phelps, supra, at p. result of criminal actibid.) from september 15, 2015 (the date that she quit her job upon learning that defendant could be released from custody), to november 20, 2015 (the date that defendant was sentenced to psychological trauma that would not have occurred had defendant not terrorized and stalked her. (people v. jones (2010) 187 cal.app.4th 418, 424427.) 11 jeanne began working as a senior media specialist at city of hope in july 2015, but stopped working on september 16, 2015, as a result of the emotional distress caused by learning that defendant could be released from custody. as she testified, her emotional distress was a direct result of the trauma she had or in this case. first, there is ample evidence that on september 15, 2015, the parties discussed the possibility of an open plea that could have resulted in probation; the prosecutor relayed that information to jeanne on that date; and jeanne suffered psychological trauma upon learning that defendant could have been released from custody, causing her to fear for her safety, to be unable to perform her work, and to quit her job. moreover, while in custody, defendant encouraged his wife take that bitch down.that what she was doing to him was vile and would send her to hell. in a jail conversation with his son, defendant referred to c---defendant subsequently pleaded guilty to the charged crimes. ding that psychological trauma that resulted in lost wages. (people v. millard, supra, 175 cal.app.4th at pp. 2930.) defendant further argues that the trial court failed to make a clear statement of the method it employed in calculating amount of restitution ordered, this claim is forfeited on appeal. (people v. anderson (2010) 50 cal.4th 19, 26, fn. 6.) 12 setting aside this procedural obstacargument lacks merit. the trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding restitution because there is a factual and rational basis for the amount that was awarded. (people v. millard, supra, 175 cal.app.4th at p. 26.) jeanne testified that, beginning in july 2015, she worked 50 hours per week at city of hope. as assuming she worked 50 hours a week, she would have earned $432.60 in one day ($43.26 multiplied by 50 is $2,163; $2,163 divided by 5 is $432.60). between september 15, 2015, and november 20, 2015, there are 49 business days. thus, jeanne would have earned $21,197.40 ($432.60 multiplied by 49).4 it follows that her request for $21,106.80, which is less that what she would have earned, was more than appropriate, and the 4 notably, this amount does not take into account monies that jeanne could have earned from freelance work that she could not complete. and, although it could have, the trial court did not impose 10 percent interest as of the date of lost wages. (people v. wickham (2013) 222 cal.app.4th 232, 238;  1202.4, subd. (f)(3)(g).) 13 disposition the order is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. _____________________, acting p. j. ashmann-gerst we concur: _______________________, j. chavez _______________________, j. hoffstadt
