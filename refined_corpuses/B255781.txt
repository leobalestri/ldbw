(a)(1))1 as count 1 and vandalism ( 594, subd. (a)) as count 2; for the box cutter incident, burglary ( 459) as count 3 and corporal the mug incident, burglary ( 1 all further statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise indicated. 3 ( 273.5, subd. (a)) as count 7. the people also alleged two enhancementsgreat bodily injury ( 12022.7, subd. (e)) and deadly or dangerous weapon ( 12022, subd. (b)(1))for the corporal injury counts during the box cutter and mug incidents. the jury convicted defendant of counts 2, 3, 4, 6 and 7 as charged, but convicted subd. (e)(1)) as lesser-included offenses of assault with a deadly weapon charged in count 1 and corpo the jury found the enhancements for great bodily injury and use of a deadly weapon true. the trial court sentenced defendant to a total of 16 years and 4 months. the court selected count principal count, and imposed an upper-term sentence of four years. on this count, the court further imposed a consecutive, upper-term five year sentence for inflicting great bodily injury and a consecutive, one year sentence for use of a deadly or dangerous weapon. the court next imposed consecutive terms (calculated as one-third the middle term) for the remaining felony counts: eight months for count 2 (vandalism); 16 months each for counts 3 and 6 (burglary); and one year for count 7 (corporal injury to parent). to the sentence for count 7, the court additionally imposed a consecutive, upper-term sentence of 16 months for inflicting great bodily injury and an additional eight months for use of a deadly weapon. the court ran sentences for the two misdemeanor offenses concurrently. defendant timely appealed. discussion i. convictions defendant argues that all of his convictions must be overturned because the trial court erred in refusing to discharge juror no. 3. a. pertinent facts during voir dire, juror no. 3 indicated that four years prior, she had witnessed her -husband beat her. although she initially indicated she would woman who said she had been beaten, she later retracted that 4 when the trial court asked the jurors as a group if they would be able to give the defendant a fair trial due to the nature of the charges and if they could follow the law, juror no. 3 did not raise her hand to indicate she could not. the jury was thereafter empanelled and sworn. the next day, and before opening statements, the trial court told the attorneys that juror n the court questioned he wrong decision thing to do with law . . . if the people . . . [have] proved their case beyond a the court asked juror no. 3 if she understood, and she said she did. defendant objected, asking that she be excused. b. analysis once a jury in a criminal case has been selected by both parties and sworn, a trial people v. cottle (2006) 39 cal.4th 246, 258-259 [but for sectias is pertinent to this case a court is required to conduct a hearingwhether or not the parties request one, and even over their objectionn to be people v. cowan (2010) 50 cal.4th 401, 506 5 (cowan), quoting people v. martinez (2010) 47 cal.4th 911, 942; people v. fuiava (2012) 53 cal.4th 622, 710 (fuiavaconduct a hearing].) because a court confronted with possible grounds for dismissal must thread but manner in which [it] conduct[s] fuiava, at pp. 710, 712; people v. clark (2011) 52 cal.4th 856, 971 (clark(people v. bradford (1997) 15 cal.4th 1229, 1348 (bradford).) our review of the trial fuiava, at p. 712): although we may not reweigh the evidence or presume good cause for removal (ibid.; people v. thomas (1990) 218 fuiava, at p. 712). defendant challenges the sufficiency of the trial correctness of its decision not to excuse juror no. 3. with respect to the inquiry, defendant makes two arguments. first, he contends that the trial court erred in not asking juror no. 3, after obtaining her response that she understood her role as a juror, whether she could fulfill that role. defendant notes that the trial court in fuiava conducted such a two-step inquiry into understanding and ability-to-follow, and argues that tinadequate inquiry into the underlying factual basis of good cause that warrants reversal under people v. mcneal (1979) 90 cal.app.3d 830, 838-839 (mcneal). as an initial matter, defendant has forfeited this issue. although a defendant overall inquiry into juror bias (cowan, supra, 50 cal.4th at pp. 506-failure to propose specific questions forfeits the right to argue that their omission, without more, was error. (see people v. holloway (2004) 33 cal.4th 96, 126 (holloway) [failure , 6 people v. burgener (1986) inquiry and later seek reversal for failure to conduct that inquiry], overruled on another ground in people v. reyes (1998) 19 cal.4th 743.) trial court investigating good (e.g., fuiava, supra, 53 cal.4th at p. 713; people v. jablonski (2006) 37 cal.4th 774, 807; holloway, supra, 33 cal.4th at p. 126), bumean that its inquiry into good cause is deficient. indeed, as our supreme court noted in people v. gutierrez (2009) 45 cal.4th 789requires a trial court to ask a potential juror whether he or she could remain impartial and unbiased before was adequate. the court had juror , from the day before, that she could be fair. what is more, juror no. 3 instanceand unlike in mcnealmcneal, supra, 90 cal.app.3d at pp. 838-839 [trial court erred in not asking juror about when coupled with her prior assurances about being fair and being able to follow the law, was sufficient. second, defendant argues that the trial to inquire whether excusal was warranted and thereby undermined its otherwise seemingly absolute declaration. with respect to the trial (holloway, supra, 33 cal.4th at p. 125.) juror no. 3 did not unequivocally declare she (fuiava, supra, 53 cal.4th at 7 p. 713; people v. collins (1976) 17 cal.3d 687, 696, superseded by  1089) or due to an people v. montes (2014) 58 cal.4th 809, 873-874). instead, she indicated she could be a fair juror in a domestic violence case and could follow the yet nevertheless stated she understood her role as a juror and how it was but this (cowan, supra, 50 cal.4th at pp. 507-508.) ii. sentencing defendant raises three challenges to his sentence: (1) the trial court erred in not staying, under section 654, all but one of the sentences imposed as to each incident; (2) the court erred in imposing a $500 domestic violence fine; and (3) the court erred in not explaining many of its discretionary sentencing decisions. do we. the conduct underlying the convictions in both counts 1 and 2 (simple assault and vandalism for the lug wrench incident), in counts 3 and 4 (burglary and corporal was, for each incident, section 654. (people v. wynne (2010) 184 cal.app.4th 1210, 1214-1215;  654, subd. (a).) for the lug wrench incident, the injury to king was incidental to the vandalism; for the box cutter and mug incidents, the burglaries were incidental to the corporal injury to charles. as a result, we conclude that the sentences for count 1 (simple assault), count 3 (burglary), and count 6 (burglary) must be stayed. (e.g., people v. conners (2008) 168 cal.app.4th 443, also no question that the $500 domestic violence fine is authorized only when a defendant is placed on probation ( 1203.097, subd. (a)), and defendant was in this case sentenced to prison; the fine must be vacated. 8 defendant forfeited his right to press his final argument. a trial court is obligated to state its reason for any discretionary sentencing decisions. (people v. pierce (1995) 40 cal.app.4th 1317, 1321.) and the trial court in this case did not state why it selected the upper-cutter incident (count 4); why it selected the upper-term sentence for the great bodily cutter incident (count 4) or the mug incident (count 7); or why it imposed consecutive (rather than concurrent) sentences for count 2 (vandalism), counts 3 and 6 (burglary), and count in this regard can be easily remedied if a defendant simply asks the court at the sentencing hearing to explain forfeits his right to raise that deficiency on appeal unless the trial court gave him no people v. scott (1994) 9 cal.4th 331, 356; people v. gonzales (2003) 31 cal.4th 745, 752.) whether defendant is entitled to a remand for resentencing consequently depends in this case on whether he had a meaningful opportunity to object during the sentencing hearing. he did. the trial court stated its intended sentence, and at no time evinced an unwillingness to considdefendant questions. (cf. people v. superior court (dorsey) (1996) 50 cal.app.4th 1216, 1223-1224 [no meaningful opportunity to object when trial court recessed immediately after imposing sentence and before parties had a chance to talk].) defendant suggests that a meaningful opportunity only exists if the trial court initially phrases its decision as a tentative sentence and thereafter affirmatively solicits objections and input, but the law is to the contrary. (gonzales, supra, 31 cal.4th at p. 755 [so holding]; people v. boyce (2014) 59 cal.4th 672, 730-are subject to forfeiturewillingness to entertain argument and input (gonzales, at p. 755; people v. downey (2000) 82 cal.app.4th 899, 916), and the record here so indicates. we consequently 9 conclude that defendant has forfeited his right to challenge the absence of reasons underlying discretionary sentencing choices. disposition the superior court is directed to modify the abstract of judgment to stay execution of the sentences imposed on counts 1, 3, and 6, and to reflect that the domestic violence fine imposed under section 1203.097 is stricken, and to forward a copy of the corrected abstract to the department of corrections and rehabilitation. in all other respects, the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. _______________________, j. hoffstadt we concur: ____________________________, p. j. boren ____________________________, j. chavez
