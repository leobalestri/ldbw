(f).) in addition to amending penal code sections 188 and 189,1 s.b. 1437 also added section 1170.95, which created a procedure whereby a person whose felony murder conviction was final, but who could not have been convicted under the amended statutes, could petition to have the conviction vacated. ( 1170.95, subd. (a).) s.b. 1437 went into effect on january 1, 2019. (see stats. 2018, ch. 1015,  4.) conviction for first degree murder and attempted second degree robbery, defendant filed a petition for resentencing pursuant to section 1170.95. the trial court denied his petition on the grounds that section 1170.95 is unconstitutional. defendant appeals, arguing that the trial court erred in finding section 1170.95 unconstitutional. the people agree that the trial court erred when it found s.b. 1437 unconstitutional. we agree with the parties. accordingly, we reverse the judgment and remand the matter for further proceedings. 1 all further statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise indicated. 3 procedural background following a jury trial, on february 1, 1999, defendant was convicted of first degree murder under a felony murder theory and attempted second degree robbery. the jury found the felony murder special circumstance allegation to be not true. defendant was sentenced to 25 years to life imprisonment. defendant timely appealed the judgment, and on december 12, 2000, we affirmed. (people v. curtis (dec. 12, 2000, b131733) [nonpub. opn.].) on january 4, 2019, defendant filed a petition for resentencing pursuant to section 1170.95. he argued that because he was convicted of first degree murder pursuant to the felony murder rule and could not now be convicted of either first or second degree murder due to the changes made to sections 188 and 189 effective january 1, 2019, he was entitled to be resentenced pursuant to section 1170.95, subdivision (d)(2). the prosecution opposed the petition, arguing that section 1170.95 is unconstitutional on the ground that it violates the separation of powers set forth in the california constitution. the people did not dispute that defendant had made a prima facie showing of entitlement to relief. defendant filed a reply, pointing out that the people had acie showing that he was factually entitled to relief. petition, again on constitutional grounds. specifically, the prosecution contended that (1) s.b. 1437 impermissibly amended two california initiatives (propositions 7 & 115); (2) section 1170.95 violated article i, section 28, subdivision (a)(6), and article 29 of the california constitution because it denied finality to victims of crimes and due process to the prosecution; and (3) section 1170.95 violated the separation of powers doctrine. 4 on april 17, 2019, the trial court issued an order to show cunder a straight felony murder theory, and we have no evidence to contend he was the actual shooter or a substantial participant. so we would be conceding on those grounds, but object on the after entertaining oral argument, the trial court found s petition on that ground. specifically, the trial court found that section new statute violated victims this timely appeal ensued. discussion defendant argues that the trial court erred in finding s.b. attorney general is providing a uniform defense of the law we agree that s.b. 1437 is constitutional law does not provide a basis for invalidating section 1170.95.2 on november 4, 2008, california voters passed proposition law), amending article i, section 28 of the california rights. article i, section 28, entitled to finality in their criminal cases. lengthy appeals and other post-judgment proceedings that challenge criminal convictions . . . and the ongoing threat that the sentences of 2 in urging us to reverse, the parties offer several arguments in support of the constitutionality of section 1170.95. because address that theory here. 5 criminal wrongdoers will be reduced, prolong the suffering of crime victims for many years after the crimes themselves have been perpetrated. this prolonged suffering of crime victims and const., art. i,  28, subd. (a)(8) [providing that the laws relating to our criminal justice process be amended to protect victim rights].) article i, and due process, a victim shall , including, for example, the right to -release from prison. (cal. const., art. i,  28, subd. (b)(7).) the constitution entitle victims to notice of, and the ability to attend, certain hearings. (cal. const., art. i,  28, subds. (b)(7)-(8).) conclusion of the case and any related post-judgment id. at subd. (b)(9).) but these provisions do not restrict legislative authority to create new postconviction procedures, such as the one set forth in section 1170.95. (see santos v. brown (2015) 238 cal.app.4th 398, 404 [despite admittedly, hearings pursuant to section 1170.95 may cause some suffering by adding a postconviction proceeding. but this is a lamentable, and inescapable, side-effect of postconviction that a murder conviction will never be revisited. having determined that section 1170.95 is constitutional, defendant successfully made a prima facie showing of entitlement 6 to relief. ( 1170.95, subds. (a) & (b).) and, by conceding that there was no evidence that defendant was the actual shooter or a substantial participant in the underlying felony, it appears that the people stipulated to eligibility. ( 1170.95, subd. (d)(2).) thus, upon remand, the trimurder conviction and resentence defendant. (ibid.; see also people v. ramirez (2019) 41 cal.app.5th 923, 933.) disposition the murder conviction and for resentencing is reversed. the matter is remanded to the trial court with directions to grant the him on the remaining count. not to be published in the official reports. _______________________, j. ashmann-gerst we concur: ________________________, p. j. lui ________________________, j. hoffstadt
