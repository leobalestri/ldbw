(a)(6).) george subsequently admitted suffering a prior conviction for a violation of health and safety code section 11350, within the meaning of penal code section 667.5. the trial court struck the prison term prior and imposed a three-year prison term. however, the resulting abstract of judgment indicated george was sentenced to prison due to a current or prior serious or violent felony conviction. as the people concede, this was incorrect. nothing in the record indicates george suffered a current or prior serious or violent felony conviction, or that the trial court sentenced him on that basis. we agree the abstract of judgment must be corrected to accurately reflect the record and the judgment pronounced in court. (people v. scott (2012) 203 cal.app.4th 1303, 1324.) disposition the trial court is directed to prepare a corrected abstract of judgment deleting any reference to george suffering a current or prior serious or violent felony conviction, and to forward a copy to the department of corrections and rehabilitation. in all other respects, the judgment is affirmed. bigelow, p.j. we concur: flier, j. grimes, j.
