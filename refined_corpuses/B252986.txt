filed 11/24/14 p. v. crocker ca2/2 not to be published in the official reports california rules of court, rule 8.1115(a), prohibits courts and parties from citing or relying on opinions not certified for publication or ordered published, except as specified by rule 8.1115(b). this opinion has not been certified for publication or ordered published for purposes of rule 8.1115. in the court of appeal of the state of california second appellate district division two the people, plaintiff and respondent, v. kevin jay crocker, defendant and appellant. b252986 (los angeles county super. ct. no. va129369) appeal from a judgment of the superior court of los angeles county. raul a. sahagun, judge. affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded with directions. john alan cohan, under appointment by the court of appeal, for defendant and appellant kevin jay crocker. kamala d. harris, attorney general, lance e. winters, senior assistant attorney general, paul m. roadarmel, deputy attorney general, for plaintiff and respondent. * * * * * * 2 kevin jay crocker (defendant) appeals his conviction and six-year sentence for a single count of second degree burglary (pen. code,  459).1 he attacks one of the jury pitchess2 motion following an in camera hearing. the people contend the trial court erred in not imposing challenge to his prior strike. we accordingly affirm the conviction and remand the matter for resentencing or for retrial conviction. factual and procedural background police discovered and arrested defendant and his codefendant cindy rodriguez (rodriguez) in the bedroom closet of an unoccupied house. rodriguez was laying atop wire strippers, wire cutters, a screwdriver, pliers, and other tools. the house itself was a shambles. yanked from the walls; lighting fixtures, bathroom sinks, molding and baseboards had been strewn all over the house. when questioned by police following waiver of his miranda3 rights, defendant initially said he had entered the house to have sex with rodriguez, but later admitted he had been in and out of the house several times in the last month to steal, strip and then sell its copper wiring. the people charged defendant, rodriguez and melinda figueroa (figueroa), whom the police found i, with a single count of burglary ( 459). conviction for battery causing serious bodily injury ( 243, subd. (d)) constituted a 1 all further statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise indicated. 2 pitchess v. superior court (1974) 11 cal.3d 531 (pitchess). 3 see miranda v. arizona (1966) 384 u.s. 436, 444-445 (miranda). 3 three strikes law ( 667, subds. (b)-(j);  1170.12, subds. (a)-(d)) as well as a prior prison term ( 667.5, subd. (b)). defendant went to trial. rodriguez, who had by that time entered a plea, was a defense witness. she testified that someone else had trashed the house before she, arrest. she said neither she nor defendant had stripped any wiring. the court instructed the jury on two theories of liability--that defendant directly burglarized the house by entering with intent to steal or vandalize, or aided and abetted the others in doing so. the jury returned a guilty verdict. defendant waived the right to a jury regarding his prior of a certified packet of minute orders regarding the 2007 conviction. the trial court sentenced defendant to the upper term of three years on the burglary conviction, doubled to six years because of the prior strike. the court imposed other fines and fees, but did not impose the $10 crime prevention fine under section 1202.5, subdivision (a). defendant timely appealed. discussion i. aiding and abetting instruction defendant argues that his conviction must be overturned because the trial court, at the initial entry and becomes aperpetrator, is an aaiding and abetting liability requires proof that the aider and abettor (1) aided the perpetrator of the charged offense, while (2) knowing of tor facilitate commission of the offense. (people v. montoya (1994) 7 cal.4th 1027, 1039; see generally people v. beeman (1984) 35 cal.3d 547, 554-555.) defendant contends that the above instruction is defective because it omits the required intent element of 4 aiding and abetting liability. we review alleged instructional errors de novo. (people v. jandres (2014) 226 cal.app.4th 340, 358.) although the special instruction defendant assails only spells out two of the three elements of aiding and abetting liability (aid and knowledge), we do not review this jury instruction in a vacuum. to the contrary, we are required to read the entire jury charge comprehensively. (people v. bland (2002) 28 cal.4th 313, 332.) the omission of any reference to the intent element in the special instruction is of no moment because the jury was elsewhere instructed--not once, but twice--that it could not find defendant guilty of aiding and abetting unless it found he intended to commit, encourage or facilitate the burglary perpetrated by the others. where an element of a crime is omitted from one instruction but is set forth in other instructions regarding the same crime, there is no error because the jury is presumed to read and follow the instructions as a whole. (people v. bolin (1998) 18 cal.4th 297, 328; people v. gray (2005) 37 cal.4th 168, 217.) ii. prior strike defendant asserts that the trial court erred in finding the minute order packet sufficient to ( 667, subds. (b)-(i);  1170.12, subds. (a)-(d).) battery is not among the list of felonies only if the people establish that the particular battery conviction at issue fits within some applicable categories are when, in the course of the battery, a person[] other than an acco 1192.7, subd. (c)(8);  667.5, subd. (c)(8)), or a [s] a dangerous or deadly weaponthis case, the minute order packet did not provide any information as to whether y conviction involved the infliction of great bodily injury to a non-5 finding must be overturned. we accordingly remand for a retrial on this issue or for resentencing. (monge v. california (1998) 524 u.s. 721, 734 [double jeopardy does not bar retrial of non-capital sentencing proceedings].) iii. the pitchess motion in camera pitchess hearing to disclosed was appropriate. we have done so, and conclude there was no error. iv. crime prevention fine the people argue that the trial court erred in not imposing the $10 crime prevention fine (along with an additional $31 in mandatory penalties and assessments) pursuant to section 1202.5, subdivision (a). the people cite people v. castellanos (2009) 175 cal.app.4th 1524 (castellanos), for the proposition that this issue may be raised for the first time on appeal. defendant responds that the people have waived their right to press this issue on appeal by waiting until now to object. whether the people have waived the right to -imposition of fines or fees for the first time on appeal turns on whether the trial court had any discretion whether to impose that fine or fee. if it did, we will presume that the non-imposition of the (people v. sharret (2011) 191 cal.app.4th 859, 864 (sharret).) but if the trial court had no discretion (because the fine or fee is mandatory in every case), we cannot presume that the non-imposition of the fine or fee was the product of any discretionary decision. (accord, castellanos, supra, 175 cal.app.4th at p. 1532 [trial court imposed base fine or fee, but not penalties and assessments; non-imposition of penalties and assessments may be raised on appeal]; people v. corrales (2013) 213 cal.app.4th 696, 702 [same].) a trial court may forego imposition of the crime prevention fine based on the lity to pay. ( 1202.5, subd. (a).) as a result, this particular fine falls on the discretionary side of the above-described dichotomy. (accord, sharret, supra, 191 -imposition of a 6 fine was a discretionary decision when court had power not to impose fine due to people v. walz (2008) 160 cal.app.4th 1364, 1369 [same].) the people are consequently barred from objecting for the first time on appeal. disposition the true finding on the prior strike conviction allegation is reversed and the sentence is vacated. the case is remanded for a retrial on the prior strike conviction allegation if the people so elect, or for a new sentencing hearing if the people do not timely go forward on the prior strike conviction allegation. in all other respects, the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. _______________________, j. hoffstadt we concur: ____________________________, p. j. boren ____________________________, j. ashmann-gerst
