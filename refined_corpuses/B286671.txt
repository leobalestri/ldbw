filed 10/30/18 p. v. cardoso ca2/3 not to be published in the official reports california rules of court, rule 8.1115(a), prohibits courts and parties from citing or relying on opinions not certified for publication or ordered published, except as specified by rule 8.1115(b). this opinion has not been certified for publication or ordered published for purposes of rule 8.1115. in the court of appeal of the state of california second appellate district division three the people, plaintiff and respondent, v. carlos cardoso, defendant and appellant. b286671 (los angeles county super. ct. no. na107726) appeal from a judgment of the superior court of los angeles county, tomson t. ong, judge. appeal dismissed. rich pfeiffer, under appointment by the court of appeal, for defendant and appellant. xavier becerra, attorney general, gerald a. engler, chief assistant attorney general, lance e. winters, assistant attorney general, paul m. roadarmel, jr. and allison h. chung, deputy attorneys general, for plaintiff and respondent. _________________________ 2 defendant and appellant carlos cardoso pled no contest to unlawfully driving or taking a vehicle. the trial court sentenced him to a term of 28 months in prison. cardoso appeals, contending the trial court abused its discretion by declining his request to recommend that he be placed in fire camp. because cardoso failed to obtain a certificate of probable cause and, in any event, his appeal is moot, we order it dismissed. procedural background cardoso was charged in a felony complaint with two counts of unlawfully driving or taking a vehicle without consent (veh. code,  10851, subd. (a)) and receiving a stolen vehicle (pen. code,  496d),1 based on offenses against two different victims, occurring in august and october, 2017.2 the making criminal threats ( 422) in 2008, and had served a prior prison term within the meaning of section 667.5, subdivision (b). pursuant to a negotiated disposition, on november 9, 2017, cardoso pled no contest to one of the vehicle code section 10851 counts. understanding you will take 28 months in state prison. you will pay restitution to all victims in all counts in this case, am i rigoso before taking the plea, the prosecutor informed cardoso of the maximum possible sentence l receive 28 months. you will [be] eligible for half time, but you have to serve that in state 1 all further undesignated statutory references are to the penal code. 2 because the facts underlying the offenses are not relevant to the issues on appeal, we do not discuss them. 3 cardoso affirmed he wished to accept the plea deal. the prosecutor advised cardoso, among other things, of his rights to a jury trial, to confront witnesses, to present a defense, and against self-incrimination, as well as the potential immigration consequences of his plea. explained that upon his release, he would be placed on parole and subject to return to custody for parole violations. cardoso indicated he understood. cardoso then entered his plea. he waived his right to be sentenced by the same judge who took the plea,3 and the sentencing hearing was continued, to be conducted by a different judge. at the november 21, 2017 sentencing hearing, the trial court sentenced cardoso to 16 months on the vehicle code section 10851 count, and one year consecutive for the section 667.5, subdivision (b) enhancement, for a total of 28 months, as agreed. it dismissed the remaining two counts. the court awarded cardoso 28 days of actual custody credit and 28 days of presentence conduct credit, for a total of 56 days. it imposed a restitution fine, a suspended parole revocation restitution fine, a court operations assessment, and a criminal conviction assessment. the following colloquy then transpired: would the court recommend fire camp? t y is that, your honor? 3 people v. arbuckle (1978) 22 cal.3d 749. 4 credits whether or not they do fire camp or not is automatically reduced to a certain percentage. talking about. under the current regulations, his current commitment, e-third time for somebody who gets half time. 30 percent? -third time under the new beautiful. the things that upset me is the department of corrections never kind of like we got blind sided. he can ask the department of corrections. i would be happy to let him do that. transcript of that made, so i [may] take a writ? doing that. it because we were never told about it. it reduces the sentence and custody credits and i wish we were advised of that. i have to find it out through a different source. it would be 30 percent time. here is what happened, i have second strikers, people who are supposed to do 80 or 85 percent time, i recommend fire camp then they end up doing 30 percent. and i have other people doing 50 percent time that never ask for fire camp and they end up doing more time than the people who are doing the serious or 5 violent felonies who ask for fire camp. because i recommend fire department of corrections make that decision. ense counsel]: if he does fire camp he is doing working the same amount of time, based on the way this plea is structured. based on that not recommending fire camp puts him in the position of not being able to earn money to pay the restitution. the court puts the victim in a worse position for him not being able to earn $500 a month or whatever it is towards restitution. then the possible earning is 52 cents an hour that he can earn sweeping the floors in the jail. [] it seems in the larger scope of things that the restitution amount . . . can be paid. again, it would be a benefit to society since the time would be the scourt would take . . . such a strong absolute position. again, he is welcome to ask the warden for fire not saying i prohibit the warden from doing that. i on december 4, 2017, cardoso filed a timely notice of appeal, stating that the appeal was based on the sentence or other matters occurring after the plea that did not affect its validity. cardoso did not obtain a certificate of probable cause. discussion cardoso argues the refusal to recommend fire camp, based on its blanket policy and its purported misunderstanding of the law, was an abuse of discretion. therefore, he urges, the matter must be remanded for resentencing. we disagree. 6 1. the appeal must be dismissed because cardoso failed to obtain a certificate of probable cause supplemental briefing on the question of whether cardosoappeal was barred because he failed to obtain a certificate of supplemental briefs, we conclude the appeal must be dismissed. section 1237.5 provides that a defendant may not appeal from a judgment of conviction upon a plea of guilty or no contest unless he or she has applied to the trial court for, and the trial court has executed and filed, a certificate of probable cause. (people v. shelton (2006) 37 cal.4th 759, 766; people v. mendez (1999) 19 cal.4th 1084, 10941095; cal. rules of court, rule 8.304(b).) a certificate is not required if the appeal is based on grounds that arose after the entry of the plea and do not affect s validity. (people v. cuevas (2008) 44 cal.4th 374, 379; cal. rules of court, rule 8.304(b)(4)(b).) purports to challenge only the sentence imposed, a certificate of probable cause is required if the challenge goes to an aspect of the sentence to which the defendant agreed as an integral part of people v. johnson (2009) 47 cal.4th 668, 678.) noncertificate issues, on the other hand, iattacks s discretionary sentencing choices left open by the plea agreement. (people v. williams (2007) 156 cal.app.4th 898, 910.) in determining whether a certificate was required, we look to the substance of the appeal. he crucial issue is what the defendant is challenging, not the time or manner in which the whether a challenge to the sentence is in substance a challenge to 7 the validity of the plea, thus rendering the appeal subject to the requirements of section 1237.5. people v. buttram (2003) 30 cal.4th 773, 781782; people v. french (2008) 43 cal.4th 36, 44; people v. panizzon (1996) 13 cal.4th 68, 79.) the requirements of section 1237.5 must be strictly applied. (people v. mendez, supra, 19 cal.4th at p. 1098; people v. mashburn (2013) 222 cal.app.4th 937, 941.) in people v. panizzon, supra, 13 cal.4th 68, the court held that a defendant who agrees to a specific sentence in return for his plea must obtain a certificate of probable cause as a prerequisite to bringing a constitutional challenge to the sentence. (id. at p. 73.) there, the defendant agreed to a plea bargain that called for a specified sentence. he received the agreed-upon sentence, but appealed without obtaining a certificate of probable cause, contending the negotiated sentence constituted cruel and unusual punishment. panizzon concluded in fact challenging the very sentence to which he attack[ed] an integral part of the pleain substance, a challenge to the validity of the plea,people v. panizzon, supra, at p. 73; see people v. williams, supra, 156 cal.app.4th at pp. 910911 [failure to obtain certificate was fatal to contention that court applied the wrong sentencing rules; the appeal challenged both the validity and the specific negotiated terms of the plea bargain, rather than sentencing choices left to the discretion].) on the other hand, people v. buttram, supra, 30 cal.4th 773, held that no certificate is required when a defendant who pleads in return for an agreed maximum sentence challenges the 8 (id. at p. 777.) buttram agreement leave issues open for resolution by litigation, appellate claims arising within the scope of that litigation do not attack the validity of the plea, and thus do not require a certificate of id. at p. 783.) a negotiated plea term that provides for a maximum sentence, rather than a specified sentence, necessarily contemplates further adversary proceedings in which the court must exercise its discretion to determine the appropriate sentence within the constraints of the bargain. (id. at p. 785.) n appellate challenge to the exercise of the discretion reserved under the bargain is therefore a postplea sentencing matter extraneous to the plea agreement not require a certificate. (id. at p. 777.) as in panizzon and unlike in buttram, cardoso agreed to a specified sentence, which included the condition that he serve his time in prison. a fire camp recommendation was not part of the negotiated disposition. the plea agreement did not leave open the question of whether the court might recommend fire camp; it specified cardoso would go to prison. thus, the plea agreement did not leave the issue of fire camp open for resolution by future litigation, nor did it contemplate further adversary proceedings in which the court would exercise discretion. cardoso pleaded no contest in exchange for a term of 28 months in prison and dismissal of two counts, which was precisely what he got. thus, an appellate attack on the failure to recommend fire camp is an attack on the plea itself. free to make any lawful bargain they choose, and the exact bargain they make affects whether a subsequent appeal, in 9 substance, is an attack on thpeople v. buttram, supra, 30 cal.4th at p. 785.) cardoso argues that fire camp is therefore, he urges, system, requesting a recommendation to serve the sentence in a fire camp did not in any way alter, or attempt to alter, the plea in support, he cites people v. lavaie (1999) 70 cal.app.4th 456. there, the defendant, an inmate in a camp facility, was convicted of escape in violation of section 4530. but people v. lavaie did not consider e interchangeable terms, or whether fire camp and state prison are one and the same in the context of a plea agreement. cases are not authority for propositions not considered. (people v. brown (2012) 54 cal.4th 314, 330.) moreover, the statute at issue, section 4530, does not support the equivalents for all escapes any prison road camp, prison forestry camp, or other prison camp or prison farm or other place while under the custody of the express inclusion of these other facilities, in addition to the words state contention. (cf. austin v. medicis (2018) 21 cal.app.5th 577, 582, 590, 597 [purposes of code of civil procedure section 352.1, subdivision (a), if he is serving a term of imprisonment in the state prison, but not if he is incarcerated in county jail].) synonymous fails, on the facts here, for another reason. the people point out that prison inmates earn custody credits at a different rate than those housed in fire camp. inmates who are 10 serving terms for non-violent felonies and who are housed at fire camp earn credits at the rate of 66.6 percent, or two days of credit for each day of incarceration. (cal. code regs., tit. 15,  3043.2, subd. (b)(5)(b), (c).) inmates serving time for non-violent offenses in non-camp facilities earn credit at the rate of 50 percent, or one day of credit for each day of incarceration. (cal. code regs., tit. 15,  3043.2, subd. (b)(4)(a).) here, not only did cardoso agree to serve his sentence in prison, but agreed he would earn custody credit at a 50 percent rate. cardoso was you will be eligible for half time, but you have to serve that in state prison (italics added.) thus, incarceration in fire camp, rather than prison, would have had a material effect on the amount of time he actually served, and therefore his request for fire camp directly impacted his plea agreement. in sum, his appeal amounts to an attack on the terms of his plea, and is not operative absent a certificate of probable cause. 2. the appeal must be dismissed because it is moot even if a certificate of probable cause was not required, the appeal must nonetheless be dismissed as moot. the parties agree thatime remaining on his sentence to complete training and be transferred to a fire camp. a case becomes moot when a court ruling can have no practical impact or cannot provide the parties with in re stephon l. (2010) 181 cal.app.4th 1227, 1231; in re esperanza c. (2008) 165 cal.app.4th 1042, 1054 [appellate court will not review questions which are moot and only of academic importance, nor will it determine abstract questions of law at the request of a party who shows no substantial rights can be affected by the 11 decision either waythis court is decide actual controversies by a judgment which can be carried into effect, and not to give opinions upon moot questions or abstract propositions, or to declare principles or rules of law which cannot affect the in re miranda (2011) 191 cal.app.4th 757, 762; in re stephon l., at p. 1231.) cardoso argues that the issue should nonetheless be decided because it is likely to recur yet evade review, and involves the public interest. (in re sheena k. (2007) 40 cal.4th 875, 879; people v. cheek (2001) 25 cal.4th 894, 897898; people v. rish (2008) 163 cal.app.4th 1370, 13801381.) we disagree. as the people point out, s fire camp placement. (see people v. lara (1984) 155 cal.app.3d 570, 576 [ordinarily, the judicial sentencing function is confined to the determination of whether incarceration in state prison is appropriate, and authority to determine the place of incarceration is vested in correctional officials; the trial court may ]; bradshaw v. duffy (1980) 104 cal.app.3d 475, 478 [court may recommend honor camp, but lacks power to commit prisoner to such a placement]; people v. flower (1976) 62 cal.app.3d 904, 912914 [rejecting contention that court should have ordered defendant to be incarcerated out institutions falls upon the director of corrections.the department of corrections and rehabilitation (cdcr) has broad . statutes and cdcr regulations govern how inmates are assessed, classified, and housed. (see, e.g.,  5068; cal. code regs., tit. 15,  3375, 3375.1, 3375.2.) thus, the issue of fire 12 camp recommendation does not present a compelling public policy question. further, cardoso has failed to provide adequate information to establish he would have been entitled to relief even had his appeal not been moot. he makes no attempt to show that, under the applicable regulations or statutes, he would have been eligible for fire camp. (see generally bradshaw v. duffy, supra, 104 cal.app.3d at pp. 481482.) he also fails to establish that contention that the trial court abused its discretion is based largely on the premise that the court was mistaken about custody credit percentages, and that in fact fire camp and prison inmates earn credits at the same rate.4 the only support offered for this proposition is a relating to proposition 57. that website does not support an appellant must support a point with reasoned argument and citations to authority. (people v. evans 4 been apprised of the custody credits earned in fire camp, and refused to recommend fire camp due to this lack of information and the cdcr unquestionably, the trial court did make several remarks indicating it was displeased by a lack of information. but, fairly quest simply because it was piqued about a perceived lack of was that it declined to make fire camp recommendations because it wished to ensure defendants served the sentences the court anticipanot indicate it based its decision on a non-individualized consideration of sentencing factors, as cardoso argues. 13 (2011) 200 cal.app.4th 735, 756, fn. 12; people v. bragg (2008) 161 cal.app.4th 1385, 13961397; people v. harper (2000) 82 cal.app.4th 1413, 1419, fn. 4.) in any event, underlying premise appears to be incorrect: as noted ante, under the relevant regulations, inmates assigned to fire camp earn credits at a considerably higher rate than do inmates in the general prison population. (see cal. code regs., tit. 15,  3043.2, subds. (b)(4)(a) & (b)(5)(b), (c).) given must be dismissed as moot. disposition the appeal is dismissed. not to be published in the official reports edmon, p. j. we concur: lavin, j. dhanidina, j.
