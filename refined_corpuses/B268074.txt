(a)). the preconviction report summarized the 3, at about 3:30 a.m., the defendant was in the commerce casino . . . . he was standing next to a poker table when he suddenly grabbed two racks of poker chips valued at $10,000 each. the defendant then ran through the casino toward the exit. an employee saw this as it happened and yelled for security. the defendant was the report noted the casino . . . when hernandez 1 statutory references are to the penal code. 3 stipulated to this factual basis for the offense. the trial court sentenced hernandez in accordance with the terms of his plea years, that is, without formal supervision, non-reportiordering him to perform 45 days of community service and pay $300 in restitution to the commerce casino. on november 4, 2014 voters enacted proposition 47, which - and theft-related offenses misdemeanors, unless the offenses were committed by certain ineligible defendants. these offenses had previously been designated as either felonies or wobblers (crimes that can be punished as either people v. morales (2016) 63 cal.4th 399, 404.) proposition 47 also added section 1170.18, which person currently serving a sentence for a conviction . . . of a felony or felonies who would have been guilty of a misdemeanor under the act that added this section (this act) had this act been in effect at the time of the to petition the trial court that entered the earlier judgment of conviction for a recall of the sentence and to be resentenced as a misdemeanant.2 (harris v. superior court (2016) 1 cal.5th 984, 989; see  1170.18, subds. (a), (b); morales, at p. 404.) with exceptions not relevant here, grand theft under section 487 is a wobbler (see people v. ceja (2010) 49 cal.4th 1, 7, fn. 6) that proposition 47 made personal property taken does nsee people v. perkins (2016) 244 cal.app.4th 129, 141.) 2 section 1170.18 also allows persons who have already completed a felony sentence to apply for reclassification of the offense as a misdemeanor. ( 1170.18, subd. (f).) 4 in september 2015 hernandez petitioned to recall his sentence and asked the court to resentence him as a misdemeanant under proposition 47. in his petition and at the hearing, hernandez contended his theft conviction was a misdemeanor under proposition 47 the people argued hernandez did not qualify for relief under proposition 47 because the value of the property he took was $20,000, notwithstanding that the court ordered restitution in the amount of $300. the trial court granted the petition, and the people timely appealed. discussion the people argue the trial court erred in granting hernabecause hernandez was not eligible for relief under section 1170.18, subdivision (a). to qualify for resentencing under that provision, the is currently serving a felony sentence for a crime that would have been a misdemeanor had proposition 47 been in effect at the time the crime was committed.people v. rivascolon (2015) 241 cal.app.4th 444, 449; accord, people v. sherow (2015) 239 cal.app.4th 875, 879; see  1170.18, subd. (a).) the people argue the grand theft offense for which hernandez was convicted did not become a misdemeanor under proposition 47 because the value of the property hernandez took exceeded $950. according to the people, the value of that property was $20,000, not the $300 the court ordered for restitution.3 3 s in the trial court appears to be the difference between the replacement value 5 property he took and even concedes he did not qualify for relief under proposition 47. on this concession, we agree the trial petition. hernandez contends, however, we should affirm the trial because, under section 17, subdivision (b)(1), his offense automatically became a misdemeanor when the trial court sentenced him to summary (i.e., unsupervised or non-reporting) probation.
