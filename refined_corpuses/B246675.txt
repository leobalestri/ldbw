[and] wash he told white that after he sold the mobile home, he would pay off his debts to the mobile home park managers. she helped appellant fill out the nt owed the management company. white did not give heape the intent to sell form, but and that [appellant was] in legal [proceedings] and for [white] to stay out of i white then encouraged appellant to speak with attorneys about the issue, and she appellant later told white white did not do anything further l she gave him water. 8 b. appellant testified that in 2012, he fell behind in his rental payments to the mobile home park. he tried to make arrangements with the management company. contacted a couple of o loan him money. he also found out that he was getting an additional inheritance of $2,500 from his fath appellant told heape that he had a plan to send the funds directly to the management office. but, she would not accept the arrangements that he had made. after appellant received the eviction notice, he planned to sell his home in order white had agreed to sell his mobile home for $20,000. an according to appellant, padilla was upset that appellant wanted more than $6,000 for his mobile home. appellant intended to pay the management company after he sold the mobile home. appellant believed that the fire started after he moved some burning cards, which he had used to light the eye of the stove, to a trash can. he stated that he did not set the fire intentionally or to ward off evil spirits. he had nothing to gain by burning his home. he did not have fire insurance. he denied telling padilla that he was going to burn down his mobile home. because he had not slept well after the fire, a friend gave appellant some hallucinogenic mushrooms. this was the first time that he had ever ingested hallucinogenic mushrooms. when appellant spoke to detective cofield, he was still s of the mushrooms. 9 discussion a. sufficiency of the evidence sn he recklessly sets fire to or burns or causes to be burned any structure, forest land, or es an inhabited structure or inhabited property 452, subd. (b).) in order to determine whether appellant was guilty of violating section 452, the jury was instructed as follows: included crime of unlawfully causing fire to an inhabited structure, the people must prove that: [] 1. the defendant set fire to or burned property or an inhabited structure; [] 2. the defendant did so recklessly; [] and [] 3. the fire burned an inhabited appellant asserts that the people did not prove that a mobile home was a structure and, therefore, there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction for the lesser included offense, violation of section 452, subdivision (b). in response, the people argue that under the plain meaning of section 452, so long as the prosecutor proved that instruction we conclude that the mobile home was a structure for purposes of section 452, subdivision (b). (people v. labaer (2001) 88 cal.app.4th 289, 292.) appellant 4 4 find this characterization not compelling, particularly given the fact that the mobile home was also referred to as a house. 10 since 2003. (ibid.) while it arguably could have been moved,5 it had been fixed to a particular location since 2003it was parked in space 134. (ibid.) it had four walls and a roof. (id. at p. 294.) it had a kitchen, living room, hallway, and at least one bedroom. (ibid.) electricity. and, the mobile home had home furnishings that burned during the fire. people v. muszynski (2002) 100 cal.app.4th 672 is misplaced. in that case, the court of appeal determined that an apartment in a complex is not a building, and therefore not a structure, for purposes of arson ( 451.5, subd. building usually describes a covered structure that stands predominately by itself and appears more separate and distinct from any other structure than connected to and a part of another structure. (id. at pp. 678679.) here, as set other mobile homes in the mobile home park. (id. at pp. 679680 [individual apartments in and distinct from the complex than connected to it. indeed, photographs indicate that the apartments were not separately constructed and later joined together. rather, the entire complex appears to have been built as a single entity, comprising multiple units. each unit constitutes an integral part of the whole complex. none could be removed without compromising the integrity of the complex because the fundamental elements of each unitwalls, ceilings, floorsare structurally inseparable from the whole. moreover, none of the units has an external shape or identity that is independent of the shape and (ibid.) in his reply brief, appellant relies heavily upon people v. goolsby (2014) 222 cal.app.4th 1323conviction ( 451, subd. (b)) for setting fire to a motor home. (goolsby, supra, at pp. 13251326, 1328.) on april 23, 2014, the supreme court granted review of 5 that the mobile home had wheels. 11 goolsby. (people v. goolsby, 2014 cal. lexis 2992 (apr. 23, 2014, s216648).) thus, we do not consider it. b. jury instructions appellant claims that the trial court violated his rights when it failed to instruct the jury that if the mobihim. in so arguing, appellant directs us to section 452, subdivision (d). appellant misconstrues the applicable subdivisions of section 452. as set forth above, sa person is guilty of unlawfully causing a fire when he recklessly sets fire to or burns or causes to be burned, any causing a fire that causes an inhabited structure or is a misdemeanor. for purposes of this paragraph, unlawfully causing a fire of property does not include one burning or csubd. (d).) appellant was convicted of violating subdivision (b) of section 452. the exception in subdivision (d) does not apply to subdivision (b). (see, e.g., people v. glover (1991) 233 cal.app.3d 1476, 1484.) to the extent appellant is arguing that the trial court should have given the jury another lesser included offense instruction regarding a violation of section 452, subdivision (d), he is mistaken. a trial court should not give a lesser included offense instruction unless there is substantial evidence that the defendant is guilty of the lesser offense and not guilty of the charged offense. (people v. redd (2010) 48 cal.4th 691, 732.) given the facts presented here, appellant could not have violated the lesser offense in subdivision (d) without violating the greater offense in subdivision (b) because the mobile home was an inhabited structure or property. 12 disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. _____________________________, j. ashmann-gerst we concur: ______________________________, p. j. boren ______________________________, j. * ferns * judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
