shimono and his partner, sergeant christopher wiley, were on patrol. in the area of rosecrans and hawthorne boulevards, sergeant shimono observed a 1994 dodge plymouth caravan exit a parking lot driveway and make a fast turn. sergeant shimono noticed that the left tail lamp was out, the car was speeding, and it was weaving in the lane and going towards the curb. sergeant shimono suspected that the driver was impaired. sergeant shimono and his partner decided to conduct a traffic stop and illuminated their overhead light bar. the caravan did not immediately stop, but turned left into a driveway in violation of the vehicle code. sergeant shimono identified appellant as the driver in court. sergeant shimono approached the passenger, shalene jeffery, while sergeant wiley approached appellant. jeffery exited the vehicle and appeared intoxicated. sergeant wiley told appellant to go to the sidewalk where sergeant shimono noticed a strong odor of alcohol coming from appellant. appellant had bloodshot eyes, slurred speech, and was unsteady on his feet. sergeant shimono asked appellant some preliminary field sobriety test questions and decided to conduct field sobriety tests to sergeant shimono conducted several tests, which revealed a strong possibility that appellant was under the influence of alcohol. sergeant shimono then administered a preliminary alcohol screening (pas) test to detect the presence of alcohol. the officers placed appellant under arrest for driving under the influence. sergeant wiley determined appellant agreed to submit to a breath test and was transported to the police station at 2:32 a.m. for that purpose by officer sean judd, who also booked appellant. 4 officer judd administered the breath test to appellant with a data master machine. the -alcohol level to be .25. officer judd obtained the same result at 2:51 a.m. testified that, in his opinion, all people with a .08 in blood or breath tests are unsafe to operate a motor vehicle.

gave appellant the car keys to drive. appellant was not intoxicated. she did not see the officers administer any sobriety tests to appellant. discussion i. admission of clets printout appellant contends that the decision in people v. morris (2008) 166 cal.app.4th 363, 373 (morris), which held that clets printouts, or rap sheets, are not testimonial, does not survive the unimelendez-diaz v. massachusetts (2009) 557 u.s. 305 [129 s.ct. 2527] (melendez-diaz). according to in melendez-diaz because the clets record was generated by law enforcement employees for the purpose of establishing a fact at a future criminal prosecution, and because the clets record is made under circumstances that would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the record would be available for use at a later trial. 5 this is shown by the fact that, in people v. martinez, supra, 22 cal.4th 106, 134, the california supreme court made it clear that the prosecution may use clets rap sheets to prove a prior conviction for purposes of increasing punishment. the admission of the should be vacated. b. proceedings below the amended information alleged that appellant had one prior conviction within the meaning of sections 667, subdivisions (b) through (i) and 1170.12, subdivisions (a) through (d) (the three strikes law). the april 14, 1986 conviction was for robbery in violation of section 211 in case no. a913841. during the court trial on the prior conviction, the prosecutor introduced the no. 6, which consisted of, inter alia, a certified document from the california department of justice callecalifornia identification index (that was an order for a 90-day commitment to determine whether appellant was eligible for probation following the conviction for section 211 and two photographs of john printout) robbery conviction.5 defense counsel voiced a foundational objection. she argued that the certifications were old for exhibits nos. 6 (2003) and 7 (1990). she stated that the documents contained multiple layers of hearsay, and the rap sheet was inadmissible. she emphasized that all of the exhibits were no more admissible in a court trial than in a jury 5 the contents of exhibit nos. 6 and 7 are described more fully post. 6 trial. defense counsel also argued that the people were obliged to prove a prior conviction by fingerprint comparison, that the photograph was 24 years old, and that some of the documents had several john mcbrides with different dates of birth and interlineated entries. the trial court replied that case law had held that rap sheets are admissible. the photograph was old, it looked like appellant, just a much younger version, and the arrest date on the photograph was january 26, 1986ththe court reviewed the documents, including the rap sheet, and stated that they all appeared to be in order. the people pointed out that all the documents were under the given to one individual based on a the trial court found beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant was the same john 11 and that, pursuant to the three strikes law, he had previously been convicted of robbery in case no. a913841. c. relevant authority the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment of the united states prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right . . . crawford v. washington (2004) 541 u.s. 36, 42 (crawford).) the confrontation clause has traditionally barred a witness who did not appear at trial unless he was unavailable to testify, and the defendant had had a prior opportunity for cross-crawford, at pp. 53-the course of police interrogation under circumstances objectively indicating that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency. they are testimonial when the circumstances objectively indicate that there is no such ongoing emergency, and that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to 7 davis v. washington (2006) 547 u.s. 813, 822.) in melendez-diaz, the united states supreme court held that notarized affidavits admitted to evidence as the sole evidence to establish that the substance the defendant for purposes of the sixth amendment. (melendez-diaz, supra, 557 u. s. at p. ___ [129 s.ct. at p. 2532].) absent a showing that the analysts were unavailable to testify at trial and that petitioner had a prior opportunity to cross-examine them, petitioner was entitled (id. at p. ___ [129 s.ct. at p. 2532]), quoting crawford, supra, 541 u.s. at p. 54.) in bullcoming v. new mexico (2011) 564 u.s. ___ [131 s. ct. 2705] (bullcomingwas a testimonial statement that could not be introduced unless the analyst was unavailable for trial and the defendant had a prior opportunity to confront that witness.

(bullcoming, supracertificate was not signed under oath, as occurred in melendez-diaz, the two documents were similar in all material respects. (bullcoming, at p. ___ [131 s.ct. at p. 2717].) d. clets printout properly admitted 1. forfeiture respondent argues that appellant failed to interpose a timely and specific objection to the admission of the rap sheet on cononly objection was on hearsay grounds. respondent contends appellant has therefore forfeited his claim that the admission of the evidence violated his sixth amendment right to confrontation. appellant argues in his reply brief that he did not forfeit this claim understood the objection to be based on confrontation clause grounds, since it remarked rap sheets were admissible. the issue is not whether the trial court had the confrontation clause in mind when it referred to case law, which its remark does not clearly indicate, but whether appellant to the admissibility of evidence will not be reviewed on appeal in the absence of a specific and timely objection in the trial court on the ground sought to be urged on people v. ashmus (1991) 54 cal.3d 932, 972, fn. 10.) as court to the nature of the anticipated evidence and the basis on which exclusion is sought, and to afford the people an opporpeople v. partida (2005) 37 cal.4th 428, 435.) our supreme court has held that a hearsay objection does not preserve a sixth amendment confrontation claim. (people v. redd (2010) 48 cal.4th 9 691, 730; see also people v. chaney (2007) 148 cal.app.4th 772, 778-779 [confrontation analysis under crawford because appellant now makes a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, we determine the merits of his claim. 2. admission of clets document crawford circumstances which would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the crawford, supra, 541 u.s. at p. 52.) the united states supreme court in bullcoming reiterated that, as stated in melendez-diaz, a document created solely for an evidentiary purpose in aid of a police investigation is testimonial. (bullcoming, supra, 564 u.s. at p. ___ [131 s.ct. at pp. 2716-2717].) melendezdiaz explained that a clerk, for example, could authenticate an otherwise admissible record, but could not do what the analysts did in that casecreate melendez-diaz, supra, 557 u.s. at p. ___ [129 s.ct. at p. 2539].) in people v. taulton (2005) 129 cal.app.4th 1218 (taulton), the court held that records of prior convictions are not testimonial and not subject to crawfordconfrontation requirement. (taulton, at p. 1221.) taulton copies of records of any state penitentiary, reformatory, county jail, city jail, or federal document acts and events relating to convictions and imprisonments. although they may ultimately be used in criminal proceedings, as the documents were here, they are not prepared for the purpose of providing evidence in criminal trials or for determining whether criminal charges should issue. therefore, these records are beyond the scope of crawford, and the court properly admitted them and considered them for the statutory taulton, at p. 1225.) 10 in morris, supra, 166 cal.app.4th 363, the court likewise held that the admission of certified records of convictions was nontestimonial. referring to reasoning, morris noted that the primary putrack necessary information regarding the arrest, conviction, and sentencing of (morris, at pp. 370-371.) the court cited the statute that authorized the creation of the (morris, at p. 371, fn. 9.) appetestimonial in melendez-diaz, the california decisions in taulton and morris no longer survive. we disagree and conclude that as taulton and morris both noted, the records at issue are not testimonial because they are prepared for the purpose of documenting the acts and events related to the convictions, rather than to prove events relevant to a criminal trial. although these records may ultimately be used in a criminal prosecution, that is not the reason for their creation. (taulton, supra, 129 cal.app.4th at p. 1225; morris, supra, 166 cal.app.4th at p. 371, fn. 9.) in melendez-diaz on the other hand, the court reasoned that the certification was, in essence, testimony, since it was the equivalent of a declaration made for the purpose of establishing or proving a fact at trial. the court emphasized that the sole purposemelendez-diaz, supra, 557 u.s. at p. ___ [129 s.ct. at p. 2529].) and, although appellant contends that melendez-diaz undercut morris, the supreme court itself in melendez-diaz did not believe that its decision marked a substantial change in confrontation clause law, stating that its conclusion crawford. (melendez-diaz at p. ___ [129 s.ct. at p. 2542].) accordingly, there is no reason to conclude that melendez-diaz requires a different result than that reached in morris, which took full 11 account of crawford. the fact that people v. martinez, supra, 22 cal.4th at page 134, held prior to the crawford decision that a clets printout was sufficiently trustworthy to satisfy admission under evidence code section 1280 does not alter the primary purpose for which the document is created. ii. sufficiency of the evidence to support prior conviction finding appellant contends that the trial court considered other inadmissible evidence, in addition to the clets printout, to find that appellant suffered the prior robbery conviction. appellant maintains that the trier of fact in the determination of the truth of a prior conviction allegation may look no further than the record of conviction. since the record of conviction is limited to documents contained in court records leading to the imposition of judgment, and the documents on which the trial court relied were outside the record of the 1986 robbery conviction, these documents are inadmissible and cannot b. relevant authority avorable to the judgment to ascertain whether it is supported by substantial evidence. in other words, we determine whether a rational trier of fact could have found that the prosecution sustained its burden of proving the elements of the sentence enhancement beyond a reasonable doubt. people v. delgado (2008) 43 cal.4th 1059, 1066-1067.) in people v. reed (1996) 13 cal.4th 217, 223, the supreme court synthesized its rule concerning what may be considered in assessing whether a prior conviction may be record of conviction to determine the substance of the prior conviction. ([people v. guerrero people v. martinez, supra, 22 cal.4th at p. 118.) 12 c. records of prior conviction consisted of: (1) a certified photocopy of a fingerprint card showing, inter alia, e, signature, the charge (section 211, robbery), and arrest date (january 26, 1986); (2) a certified document from the california department of justice name, arrest date (january 26, 1986), cii number (a07601499), date of conviction (april name, signature, c-day placement disposition; and (4) two 6 disposition.7 exhibithe documents that follow; (2) two photographs of john mcbride showing an arrest date of jacopy of a fingerprint card that contains no identifying information. 6 the probation flash notice is a form letter sent from the probation department of los angeles county to the chief of the bureau of identification in sacramento requesting notification of any additional arrests of the named subject before the date of 7 these documents also contain a date of birth, but this varies between the documents, although they are all in 1965, and january 28, 1965, appears the most often. 13 d. evidence sufficient y the people to prove the fact of the prior robbery conviction were not admissible as being outside the people v. woodell (1998) 17 cal.4th 448, 454; see people v. trujillo (2006) 40 cal.4th 165, 177 [noting that in people v. guerrero, supra, 44 cal.3d 343, the that the term . . . [citation], or more narrowly, as referring only to those record documents reliably reflecting the facts of the offense for which the defendant wpeople v. trujillo, supra, 40 cal.4th at p. 177, citing people v. reed, supra, 13 cal.4th at p. 223.) people v. woodell beyond the record of conviction, the high court did not intend to create arbitrary and artificial barriers to proving the existence of the prior conviction. rather, it merely intended to prevent the people from introducing new evidence outside the record of the people v. woodell, supra, 17 cal.4th at pp. 455-456.) in the instant case, the record contains, for example, a superior court order committing appellant for a 90-day assessment. the commitment document reflects that appellant suffered a conviction for a robbery ( 211). this is proper evidence that appellant suffered a prior conviction for that offense. the fact that the order of commitment was made after serious felony. the order of commitment is part of the record of the conviction, relating to punishment, and resort to such evidence does not violate the policies discussed in people v. guerrero. (see people v. guerrero, supra, 44 cal.3d at p. 355; people v. scott (2000) 85 cal.app.4th 905, 913-914 [prison records may be used to show the fact of a conviction but not the substance of a conviction].) 14 in this case, unlike most others in which the proof of a prior conviction has been disputed, the issue is not the substance of the prior conviction. (see, e.g., people v. delgado (2008) 43 cal.4th 1059, 1067-1070; people v. reed, supra, 13 cal.4th at p. 221; people v. myers (1993) 5 cal.4th 1193, 1198.) this is because all robberies are serious felonies and qualify as strikes under the three strikes law. ( 667, subd. (d)(1); 667.5, subd. (c)(9); 1192.7, subd. (c)(19).) there is a significant difference between cases where the question is the substance of the prior conviction and cases such as this one in which the question is the fact of the prior conviction of a serious felony that is such by definition. (see people v. dunlap (1993) 18 cal.app.4th 1468, 1476.) here, there is no people v. martinez, supra, 22 capeople v. guerrero, supra, 44 cal.3d at p. 355.) behind the people v. johnson (1992) 3 cal.4th 1183, 1242.) other types of evidence (e.g., other official records) satisfy applicable rules for people v. dunlap, supra, at p. 1476; see evid. code  452.5, 1530.) conviction presumptively establish that the conviction in fact occurred, assuming those records meet the threshold rethis presumption before the authenticity, accuracy, or sufficiency of the prior conviction records can be casuch records, prima facie evidence of a prior conviction that satisfies the elements of the recidivist enhancement at issue, and if there is no contrary evidence, the fact finder, utilizing the official duty presumption, may determine that a qualifying conviction people v. delgado, supra, 43 cal.4th at p. 1066.) appellant made no attempt to rebut the properly admitted evidence in this case. 15 we conclude that the evidence presented was not outside the record of conviction conviction charged in the information, which was a serious felony within the meaning of the three strikes law. this is especially true in light of the fact that we have determined disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. __________________, p. j. boren we concur: ___________________, j. doi todd ___________________, j. ashmann-gerst
