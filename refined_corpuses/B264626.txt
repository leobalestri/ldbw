hadley never gave moore any money. 13 e. defendant rosechell murray the four charges against murray in the fourth amended information were perjury (count 39), conspiracy to commit grand theft (count 40), conspiracy to commit perjury (count 41), and misdemeanor grand theft (count 67). 1. prosecution evidence murray worked as a bus driver, and first received childcare benefits through crystal stairs in 2005 or 2006. in february 2007, murray received a notice that her services had been terminated because she failed to report within five days (as required) that she stopped working in december 2006 and went on maternity leave. murray appealed with she was on bed rest from december 11, 2006, until she delivered on january 8, 2007. in june 2007, crystal stairs notified murray her appeal had been successful and she was eligible to reapply for childcare services. but a written warning dated july 3, 2007 emphasized murray must report changes in employment, training, family income, or family size within five calendar days, or her childcare services would end, as provided in the parent handbook (which murray acknowledged receiving on january 30, 2008). the handbook also stated up to eight hours a day of child care was available if a parent was incapacitated or disabled, and form for parents to use with murray reapplied to crystal stairs for child care on december 4, 2008, stating she lived in hawthorne and worked as a bus operator for first transit. she requested hadley as a provider for her four children, and she signed the participant december 11, 2008, approving a maximum of 41.43 hours a week 14 for each child. in april 2009 veolia transportation verified eceived approval for weekly child care of 47.52 hours in may 2009, 41 hours in november 2009, and 52.43 hours in january 2010. murray went on family medical leave in february 2010. veolia payroll records showed she did not work from march through july, returned to work in august, and worked through october 2010. yet attendance records signed by murray and hadley showed murray dropped off and picked up her children at the approved hours in march, april, may, june, and july 2010. murray also submitted to crystal stairs six earnings statements for july to september 2010 with multiple errors and inconsistencies, including the same check number on each statement, her name misspelled security number, and an incorrect address. 2. defense evidence murray submitted an august 5, 2014 by enrique ramos, m.d., who first saw murray in 2001 for acute depression and marital discord. dr.

and would have been unable to care for her children monday through friday, from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. at trial, dr. ramos testified he had treated murray for depression since 2001, and more recently for bipolar disorder. murray was tired, emotional, and angry. she had mood swings, tried to hurt herself, and experienced suicidal thoughts, memory 15 loss, and cognitive disruptions. he saw murray on april 29, 2009, noted she had a panic disorder and depression, and prescribed zoloft and clonazepam. dr. ramos also saw murray on july 30, 2009. based on his conversations with murray and his assessment of her mood, dr. ramos believed the statements he made on the 2014 statement of incapacity were correct, and murray had been incapable of caring for her children from may 1, 2009 through august 6, 2010. s contemporaneous notes were consistent with that conclusion. on july 21, 2010, dr. ramos wrote murray could return to work on july 22; she had told him she was ready to go back to work. on cross-examination, torres testified if crystal stairs children, the parent could receive childcare subsidies. but dr. ramos could not demonstrate murray was eligible to receive childcare funding for her disability in 2010. as murray knew, she had five calendar days to report any changes in her work status to allow crystal stairs to verify she was incapacitated and eligible to continue to receive childcare funding. in her interactions with crystal stairs in 2010, murray never gave any indication she was on disability leave. when flumerfelt interviewed murray on november 29, 2010, she told him she had been on medical leave. in closing, the prosecutor argued that in 2009 and 2010 murray received childcare funds from crystal stairs but did not inform crystal stairs she was on disability. instead, she submitted fake check stubs to show she was working. f. defendant suzan mcfadden the 10 charges against mcfadden in the fourth amended information were perjury (counts 25, 26, 27, 31, 32), forgery 16 (counts 28, 29, 30), conspiracy to commit grand theft (count 33), and conspiracy to commit perjury (count 34). after closing argument and before the jury began deliberations,

convictions were for perjury and conspiracy. those crimes are not easy to prove. perjury requires proof of an oath or a certification under who . . . certifies under penalty of perjury . . . and willfully states as true any material matter which he or she knows to be false, is 118, subd. (a).) 21 measure of proof than any other crime known to the law, treason [citation], evidence is required [citation]. . . . necessary to have positive testimony as to facts that are absolutely incompatible ] is not sufficient to support the charge of perjury that the accused swears to a material fact that is false, the false swearing must be knowingly and willfully done. [citation.] [i]n addition to knowingly making a false statement, there must be a specific intent that the false statement be under oath or penalty of people v. viniegra (1982) 130 cal.app.3d 577, 585586.) the element of the statute stating that the defendant must requires proof the defendant made such statement know that it was true, and with the intent that it should be people v. hagen (1998) 19 cal.4th 652, 663664.) requirement of section 124 is an element of perjury in cases involving a false certificate.

(b)), courts have by at least one witness is generally required. [citations.] evidence is insufficient under the direct evidence rule that merely establishes facts from which the falsity of an alleged (alcocer, supra, people v. gamble (1970) 8 cal.app.3d 142, 147, fn. 2), and circumstantial evidence suffices for the required corroboration. (people v. morris (1971) 20 cal.app.3d 659, 664 & fn. 2.) corroborating evidence may be slight, and need not prove all the elements of the charged offense.

(id. at pp. 259.) prove an agreement, it is not necessary to establish the parties met and shown by direct or circumstantial evidence that the parties positively or tacitly came to a mutual understanding to accomplish the act id. at p. 264.) the jury was instructed that they must all agree that at least one alleged overt act was committed within the statute of limitations, but they did not have to agree which specific overt act was committed, or who committed the overt act. i. angela hadley hadley argues insufficient evidence supports her convictions on counts 39, 40, 41, and 47, and instructional error requires reversal of all her convictions of perjury (counts 5, 6, 25, 26, 27, 39, 46, 50, and 58). a. convictions on counts 39, 40, and 41 on a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution to determine whether any rational trier of fact could have found the elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. (people v. 24 young of the judgment the existence of every fact the trier could ibid.) 1. count 39 (perjury with murray) count 39 alleged that on or between may 1, 2009 and july 31, 2009, hadley and murray committed perjury by declaration in violation of section 118, subdivision (a), when they signed under penalty of perjury the attendance records stating hildren. the court instructed the jury that the false statement was that the attendance records. the jury convicted hadley and acquitted murray on this count. hadley signed attendance records printed with the 5038 april), june 2, 2009 (for may), and july 1, 2009 (for june). hadley signed the attendance records under a declaration stating, that i provided child care services as indicated on this attendance record for the above named child and the services were rendered according to the hadley argues no evidence established that the dates and times on the attendance records were false, or that any false dates or times were material, so that her signatures under penalty of perjury did not constitute perjury. we agree with hadley that no evidence established that the days and times recorded were not true. dr. ramos testified that murray would have been unable to care for her children beginning in may 2009. although murray was no longer working, no evidence established that murray did not continue to 25 child care, dropping off and picking up her children at the times indicated. hadley would therefore not have made any false statements under penalty of perjury by signing the attendance records. perjury when she signed the attendance records because she was no longer providing child care at the 5038 address appearing on the pre-the approved hours, but do not bear any address or indicate the reason for child care. penalty of perjury where she provided the child care or the purpose for which care was provided. in the absence of substantial evidence that on or between may 1 and july 31, 2009, murray did not drop off and pick up her children as reflected on the attendance records hadley signed count 39. 2. count 40 (conspiracy with murray to commit grand theft) grand theft occurs when the money taken exceeds $950. ( 487, subd. (a).) count 40 alleged that on or between may 1, 2009 and july 31, 2010, hadley and murray conspired to commit grand theft in violation of section 182, subdivision (a)(1), and section 487, subdivision (a), by committing the overt acts of turning in attendance records for july 2009, september 2009, october 2009, 26 january 2010, and april 2010.12 the jury found hadley and murray guilty. hadley again argues the record contains no substantial evidence that the attendance records were false. she also argues no evidence shows she ever reached an agreement with murray to steal childcare funds. hadley signed the provider fraud policy, which defines fraud as giving false or misleading information on attendance forms, and/or intentionally not giving information that could cause child care to be reduced or terminated. if substantial evidence showed hadley and murray agreed to submit attendance records for payment even though hadley knew murray was not working, was not approved for disability, and therefore was not entitled to child care, and hadley committed at least one overt act by submitting one of the listed attendance records the people contend substantial evidence supports a single overt act, the submission of the attendance records for september 2009 on or around october 7, 2009, and argue . . . signatures appear in what is obviously hadleythe jury could infer that murray knew that hadley forged this is without merit. first, the people do not cite to any evidence at trial that 12 40 by condensing the overt acts into a single, additional overt act with a time frame extending into october 2010. we therefore do not consider the earning statements murray submitted to crystal stairs for july through september 2010, which contain multiple errors and inconsistencies. the earning statements are outside the period alleged in count 40. 27 signatures on the september 2009 attendance records. second, even if hadley did sign the september 2009 attendance records for murray, the people point to no evidence that murray knew that hadley forged her signature. third, if the signatures on the september 2009 those attendance records are not evidence that hadley and murray intended to agree to commit grand theft. in the absence of substantial evidence that hadley and murray intentionally agreed to commit grand theft and committed an overt act during the time period alleged in the , and necessarily to commit grand theft in count 40. 3. count 41 (conspiracy with murray to commit perjury) count 41 alleged that on or between may 1, 2009 and july 31, 2010, hadley and murray conspired to commit perjury, and committed five overt acts of submitting attendance records for august 2009, november 2009, february 2010, june 2010, and july 2010. we conclude that no substantial evidence established that any of the overt acts constituted perjury. the attendance records submitted for august 2009 showed ha. we have already rejected the address on the preprinted form as direct evidence of falsity. the third, fourth, and fifth overt acts allege the submission of attendance records for february 2010, june 2010, and july 2010 (all of which bore the 3714 address).13 the people argue 13 the people do not argue that the attendance records of perjury. 28 dr. ramosstablish that murray was on medical leave from work during those months and that hadley therefore committed perjury when she signed the attendance records stating that she provided childcare services when murray was not working. but as we explained in our discussion of count 39,14 on this attendance record for the above named child and the services were rendered according to the certificate of enrollment signatures on the attendance records did not certify under penalty of perjury where she provided the child care or the purpose for which care was provided.15 in the absence of substantial evidence supporting any of conviction, and necessa of conspiracy to commit perjury on count 41. 14 count 39 alleged that hadley committed perjury during a shorter time period, may 1, 2009 to july 31, 2009. 15 a correlative proposition is that the government should turn people v. jensen (1979) 94 cal.app.3d 451, 455.) we turn square corners with the women defendants in this case by holding them to the precise language of their declarations under penalty of perjury. 29 b. on count 47 (conspiracy with moore to commit grand theft) count 47 alleged that on or between may 1, 2009 and march 31, 2010, hadley and moore (who pled no contest to grand theft and testified at trial) conspired to commit grand theft in violation of section 182, subdivision (a)(1), and section 487, subdivision (a), and committed two overt acts of submitting attendance records for june 2009 and august 2009. hadley was evicted from the 5038 address in may 2009. cornelius foster testified she moved her childcare operation back to the birch address, where she provided child care from may to october 2009. moore testified that she dropped her two children off for child care only four times at the birch address. yet hadley average of 13 hours each day. moore testified the signatures on the june 2009 and august 2009 attendance records were hers. moore and hadley signed the june 2009 and august 2009 attendance records on the same dates, which is circumstantial evidence that they came to a mutual understanding, either positively or tacitly, that they would submit false attendance records to crystal stairs so hadley would receive overpayments. (see people v. johnson, supra, 57 cal.4th at p. 264.) substantial evidence also supports the two overt acts, and the june 2009 attendance record alone resulted in an overpayment to hadley of $1,497, above the $950 threshold for grand theft. viction of conspiracy to commit grand theft on count 47. 30 c. the materiality instruction was correct hadley, sanford, and mcfadden argue instructions on perjury removed the element of materiality from n, invalidating all their perjury convictions.16 none of the defendants objected, but even in the absence of a request we will review a claim that the instruction was an incorrect statement of the law. (people v. hudson (2006) 38 cal.4th .) the element of materiality is for the jury to decide. (people v. kobrin (1995) 11 cal.4th 416, 420.) informs the jury that a false statement is material if it could probably influence the outcome of the proceeding . . . conveys the requirement that the false statement must be important to the matter under discussion. it also conveys to the jury that false statements on matters not pertinent to the proceeding do not (people v. rubio (2004) 121 cal.app.4th 927, 933, italics added.it could influence the outcome of the proceeding is simply too ibidpeople v. morera-munoz (2016) 5 cal.app.5th 838, 85 . . . . instead it is a review of the potential to influence a listener . . . . in other words, is the false statement objectively capable of influencing id. at p. 859.) prove the defendants declared under penalty of perjury 16 conviction (conspiracy to commit perjury with hadley, count 41). 31 the statements under penalty of perjury, intended to make the false statements under penalty of perjury, and signed and delivered, or caused another to sign and deliver, the declaration to someone else intending that it be circulated as true. the instruction also staan agency to authorize child care, set child care hours or pay a certain amount to a child care provider. [] the people do not need to prove that the defendant knew that the information in her statement was the court adequately instructed the jury on the materiality element. the instruction did more than state that a false outcome of the proceeding; it stated that a false statement was agency to authorize child care, set hours, or pay a certain amount enotes certainty. the instruction set a higher standard for materiality than case law requires, and made it clear that the false statement had to be important to the agency to be material. the defendants nevertheless argue that the instruction allowed the jury to find any error on the forms material, no matter how insignificant the mistake. to the contrary, the instruction viewed as a whole told the jury that an intentionally false statement was material if it would cause crystal stairs to authorize child care, authorize a number of hours, or pay for a certain amount of child care. defendants also argue the instruction allows a false statement to be material even if the falsity resulted in only a small overpayment. a false statement 32 that could probably influence the government agency is material (for the purposes of the perjury statute) without regard to how much the government agency overpaid as a result. it is the statement that must be material, not the amount overpaid. we find no error in the materiality instruction. ii. rosechell marquerite murray we concluded above that insufficient evidence supports theft on count 40 and conspiracy to commit perjury on count 41. murray argues that we must also reverse her sole remaining conviction for misdemeanor grand theft (count 67) because the one-year statute of limitations for misdemeanor prosecutions applied, and the prosecution commenced more than one year after the discovery of the offense on september 20, 2009. she does not argue that insufficient evidence supports her conviction. the complaint filed april 30, 2012 named murray with hadley in count 35, felony grand theft on or between may 1, 2009 and july 31, 2010. at her preliminary hearing murray moved to reduce count 35 to a misdemeanor, and on november 2, 2012 the magistrate granted the motion: because count 35 named hadley as well, the court stated it would dismiss count 35 as to murray and then add count 67 as a misdemeanor count. nevertheless, the original information filed november 15, 2012 charged murray and hadley with felony grand theft on or between may 1, 2009 and july 31, 2010 in count 35.17 an amended information filed february 20, 2013 continued to name murray in count 35. on december 31, 2013 murray 17 hadley does not appeal her conviction on count 35. 33 moved to set aside count 35 as the magistrate intended. the court granted the motion and, on january 13, 2014, amended the information to reinstate an allegation of misdemeanor grand theft by murray in count 67. the prosecutor filed an amended information adding count 67 on february 6, 2014, alleging murray committed misdemeanor grand theft on or between may 1, 2009 and july 31, 2010. the fourth amended information alleged murray committed misdemeanor grand theft by unlawfully taking childcare funds on or between may 1, 2009 and july 31, 2010.18 offense is an alternative felony/misdemeanor (wobbler) initially charged as a felony, the three-year statute of limitations for felonies applies, without regard to the ultimate reduction to a people v. crabtree (2009) 169 cal.app.4th 1293, 13091310.)19 because 18 lawyer admitted that the april 30, 2012 complaint was timely as to count 67, as the three-year statute of limitations for a felony applied to the misdemeanor count originally charged as a felony. the people argue that murray thus waived the statute of limitations. waiver may be possible advantage to waive the statute people v. williams (1999) 21 cal.4th 335, 340.) this jurisdictional issue at any time. (people v. soni (2005) 134 cal.app.4th 1510, 1514.) 19 the reduction of the felony in count 35 to a misdemeanor in count 67 was not based on the offense as a necessarily included misdemeanor, in which case the one-year statute of limitations 34 grand theft is a wobbler offense and the initial charge against murray in count 35 was felony grand theft, the three-year statute of limitations applies after the reduction of the felony count to misdemeanor grand theft in count 67. the prosecution began april 30, 2012, within three years of september 20, 2009. on counts 40 and 41, and we affirm her conviction of misdemeanor grand theft on count 67. iii. suzan mcfadden mcfadden argues insufficient evidence supports her convictions for perjury on counts 25, 26, 27, 31, and 32, forgery on count 29, and conspiracy with hadley to commit perjury on counts 33 and 34. she also argues that exhibits were admitted in error, undermining her convictions on counts 29, 31, 32, and 33. a. conviction on counts 25 and 32; insufficient evidence supports her convictions on counts 26, 27, and 31 mcfadden argues the evidence of perjury was insufficient entirshowed that errors on her attendance records and employment was not corroborated; hadley maintained and submitted the 1. count 25 (perjury with hadley) count 25 alleged that on or between november 1 and december 5, 2008, mcfadden and hadley committed perjury for misdemeanors applies. (people v. mincey (1992) 2 cal.4th 408, 453.) 35 when they declared under penalty of perjury that hadley the attendance record. the exhibits included october 2008 d) signed by both women on november 1,20 and a november 2008 daily attendance record signed on december 4. mcfadden argues there was no evidence whatsoever that her children did not attend child care for the time periods on the documents she and hadley signed for october and november 2008. in response, the people argue that the forms bore the old 5038 address. we have already rejected this as a basis for a perjury conviction. the people argue that mcfadden and hadley claimed more childcare hours than hadley could possibly have provided. mcfadden was approved for child care for 10 to 15 hours on weekdays and six hours on saturday (a total of more than 80 hours). the october 2008 provider payment requests listed 80 weekday daytime hours and 80 weekday nighttime hours for each week (as well as additional weekend hours). the people also paperwork provided that one of her 20 mcfadden and hadley signed the october 2008 provider penalty of perjury that this information is true and correct, and that the child care was provided for the purpose for which child care was certified. i understand that i may be prosecuted for fraud and required to repay any overpayment resulting from false or incorrect information provided herein. i understand that over billing on this report can lead to legal action resulting in 36 children was in school in october 2008, and no care was authorized between 8:30 a.m. and 1:30 or 3:30 p.m. viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution, this is evidence of perjury on the provider payment request, on which mcfadden and hadley certified that the information was true and correct. the people also argue that mcfadden stopped working at papnot need all the hours of child care claimed for october and november. we agree there is and november 2008. although signatures on the november attendance record did not certify under penalty of perjury that mcfadden operation because she was working, her signature on the october provider payment request certified this is corroborating evidence that mcfadden and hadley committed perjury on the october 2008 provider payment request form. we affirm on count 25. 2. count 26 (perjury with hadley) count 26 alleged that hadley and mcfadden committed perjury on or between january 1, 2009 and december 31, 2009, angela hadley provided child care for suzan the people point to attendance records for march 2009 showing that on march 18, mcfadden signed in her two sons around 6:00 a.m. and signed them out at 11:08 p.m., and yet the state licensing analyst testified that when she visited from 7:30 a.m. to 9:45 a.m., she recorded that only one child (not related to defendants) was present. this is not evidence that 37 mcfadden and hadley committed perjury. the analyst testified when she arrived, hadley was taking some children to school; hadley returned fifteen minutes later. were in school in 2009, as recorded in the notice of action and certificate of enrollment. the logical inference is that when the en to school. the people also argue that mcfadden and hadley committed perjury on january 5, 2009, when they signed the december 2008 attendance record, because mcfadden claimed more child care in december 2008 than her actual work and training schedule required. again, their signatures on the attendance record certify under penalty of perjury only that hadley provided child care according to the schedule authorized by crystal stairs and the certificate of enrollment, not that mcfadden used the hours of child care for the reasons she claimed when she applied. the people also cite to additional pages of the record as identified exhibits are evidence of perjury. perjury, unlike fraud, requires thpeople v. jenkins (1980) 28 cal.3d 494, 503, italics omitted), and, as we explained above, requires corroborating evidence to support a conviction. insufficient evidence supports mcfadden conviction of perjury on count 26. 38 3. count 27 (perjury with hadley) count 27 alleges that on or between january 1 and february 5, 2010, hadley and mcfadden committed perjury by 2010 signatures on the attendance record for january 2010, which showed that mcfadden signed one child in at 2:05 p.m. on january 27. flumerfelt testified that he arrived outside the 3714 address at 1:08 p.m. and left at 4:15, but saw no activity at 2:05 p.m. -off time on the attendance record for january 27 was false. without corroborating evidence, however, his testimony alone is not sufficient evidence to support a perjury conviction under section involvement with hollins a general lack of activity at the 3714 address, but testimony established that the rental agreement ended in january 2010 and hollins moved out. the people point to no other evidence corroborating convictions for perjury on count 27. 4. counts 31 and 32 (perjury) counts 31 and 32 allege that mcfadden committed perjury when, on april 9, 2009 and on february 18, 2010, she declared under penalty of perjury that she worked for papa afternoons and evenings. 39 a. no abuse of discretion to admit the records evidence at trial were inadmissible hearsay. we conclude the trial court did not abuse its wide discretion in determining whether sufficient foundation is laid to qualify evidence as a people v. lugashi (1988) 205 cal.app.3d 632, 638639.) ramon testified the records from cocomn . as the current manager of the papa j computer record at the after defense counsel objected to her testimony, the prosecutor stated at sidebar that ramon brought up the screen with mcfaddenand the investigator took a photograph of the computer screen. ramon later printed out the time clock report. the trial court questioned whether ramon qualified as the custodian of records from the franchise when cocom was the manager. ramon testified the time clock record was made before she the record was routinely kept, and was the basis for paychecks; the employees placed the hours in the computer on the recorded dates, punching in and out using the last four digits of their social security numbers; and the time clock record was the most accurate indication of when mcfadden last worked. the court initially denied admission of the records. after a recess, the court admitted both the time clock record and the screen shot, concluding that ramon did not have to have been the custodian of records at the time the records were created to 40 testify that the records were made in the usual course of business. before the jury, ramon testified that she printed out the time clock record before coming to court. she had no idea why the time clock record showed last day in july 2008, while her employee record showed a last day in july 2008 but also a hire date in april 2009 and a termination date in august 2009. on cross-examination, she stated that the employee generated the time clock record, and the manager in charge would have entered the information on the computer employee record, which could not be changed. evidence code section 1271 allows admission of a writing made as a record of an act or event if: in the regular course of a business; (b) the writing was made at or near the time of the act, condition, or event; (c) the custodian or other qualified witness testifies to its identity and the mode of its preparation; and (d) the sources of information and method and time of preparation were such as to indicate its d not be the custodian, the person who created the record, or one with personal knowledge in order for a business record to be (2017) 16 cal.app.5th 159, 170; jazayeri v. mao (2009) 174 cal.app.4th 301, 322.) as to the accuracy of [computer] printouts, whether resulting from incorrect data entry or the operation of the computer program, as with inaccuracies in any other type of business records, [affect] only the weight of the printouts, not their admissibility.people v. martinez (2000) 22 cal.4th 106, 132.) 41 we see no clear showing of abuse of discretion in the trial the ramon testified regarding the once created, the records could not be changed. it was up to the jury to decide whether the records were accurate and what weight to give them. b. insufficient evidence of perjury in count 31 on april 9, 2009, mcfadden signed a crystal stairs every day except sunday, starting as early as 4:10 p.m. and information stated above and any documentation submitted herewith, are true and correct to the best of my knowledge, and that none of such information or documentation is misleading, 21 this declaration is consistent with the papa employee record showing that mcfadden was hired on april 9, 2009, with a termination date of august 14, 2009. while the same computer record, as well as the time clock 2008, this equivocal and contradictory evidence (characterized by the ) is not sufficient to show that her april 9, 2009 statement was false, and the people point to no corroborating evidence that mcfadden committed perjury. 21 the people also cite to an employment verification dated april 9, 2009, but only cocom signed that document under penalty of perjury. 42 c. sufficient evidence of perjury in count 32 count 32 alleges that mcfadden committed perjury when, on february 18, 2010, she declared that she worked for papa on february 18, 2010, mcfadden signed a confidential application and certification of eligibility stating that she and, that the above information is true and correct to the best of my the both evidence of perjury. the time clock record showed a last date of work of july 19, 2008, and the employee record shows mcfadden was terminated at the very latest in august 2009. ramon, starting in september 2009 and became the manager in march 2010, testified that she never met mcfadden, which corroborates the documentary evidence that mcfadden did not work at papa conviction on count 32. b. conviction on count 29 (forgery) count 29 alleges mcfadden committed forgery in violation of section 470, subdivision (d), when she made and submitted a false and forged employment verification on or between april 9, 2009 and may 6, 2009. under section 470, subdivision (d), anyone who, with the intent to defraud, forges, or counterfeits, utters, publishes, passes or attempts or offers to pass, as true and genuine, any of a long list of items is the essential element of the 43 crime of forgery . . . people v. martinez (2008) 161 cal.app.4th 754, 762.) an employment verification form received by crystal stairs stated thafrom 4:00 or 5:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. the form bears an april 29, 2009 signature by supervisor cocom, declaring under penalty of perjury that the information on the form is true and correct. contrary to th did not sign under penalty of perjury; her signature on the top of the form merely authorized her employer to release information to crystal stairs. the employment verification is consistent with the papa loyee record showing that mcfadden was hired on april 9, 2009, with a termination date of august 14, 2009 was in july 2008). the computer record is evidence that the information on the employment verification form is true, not false. the people argue that mcfadden forged cocomprosecutor presented no testimony to that effect, and did not rely on that theory at trial.22 section 470, subdivision (a), makes it forgery to sign the name of another person on any of the items listed in subdivision (d). as there is insufficient evidence that the employment verification is false, the form is not an item listed in 22 the prosecutor stated in closing argument he could not say 44 subdivision (d). if the information is not false, mcfadden lacked any reason to forge cocom23 c. insufficient evidence supports mcfadden and convictions on count 33 (conspiracy with hadley to commit grand theft) count 33 alleged that hadley and mcfadden conspired to commit grand theft on or between april 1, 2008 and february 28, 2010. the employment verifications on march 20, 2007, april 23, 2007, september 3, 2008, and april 30, 2009,24 and her application for child care on february 18, 2010, all of which claimed mcfadden the employment verification received by crystal stairs on septema july 14, 2008 signature by manager cocom. the computer records show mcfadden still working as of that date. we have already concluded the evidence was insufficient to show the april 30, 2009 employment verification was false. we have also concluded that the evidence was sufficient to show child care and certification for eligibility, which stated that she still worked at 23 in addition, the bottom of the form states, under office use only,tairs employee spoke to cocom 24 to conform the information to proof, at the end of trial the prosecutor changed the first four overt acts in count 33 from attendance records to employment verifications. we do not discuss the first two employment verifications, which occurred in 2007, before the time period alleged in count 33. 45 lse. one overt act is supported by substantial evidence. but more is required for a conspiracy conviction. substantial evidence must support an agreement between mcfadden and hadley. hadley did not sign the application form. the people argue that hadlapplication form to crystal stairs, and this constituted an agreement. the people do not cite to any part of the record that application for child care, or that hadley knew mcfadden no . in the absence of any evidence that mcfadden conspired with hadley when mcfadden falsely stated under penalty of perjury that she continued to work rev conviction, and necessarily conviction, for conspiracy to commit grand theft in count 33. d. insufficient evidence supports mcfadden and convictions on count 34 (conspiracy with hadley to commit perjury) count 34 alleged that mcfadden and hadley conspired to commit perjury on or between august 1, 2009 and february 28, 2010. the three overt acts alleged were the submission of attendance records on september 8, 2009 for august 2009; on december 7, 2009 for november 2009; and on february 5, 2010 for january 2010. we have already determined that the evidence was insufficient to show that mcfadden committed perjury when she signed the january 2010 attendance record on february 5, 2010. as to the august 2009 and november 2009 attendance records, 46 the attendance records did not certify under penalty of perjury the reason for which child care was provided. the people cite no or august 2009 and november 2009 did not reflect the child care actually provided by hadley. we therefore conclude that none of the overt acts is supported by sufficient evidence. we reverse tion, and necessarily r conspiracy to commit perjury in count 34. iv. erica sanford sanford argues that insufficient evidence supports her convictions on counts 58, 63, and 71, and that count 71 is outside the statute of limitations. a. insufficient evidence supports convictions on count 58 (perjury by declaration with hadley) count 58 alleges that hadley and sanford committed perjury on or between may 1, 2009 and january 31, 2010, when true, that which was known to be false, to wit: that angela hadley ated on on december 17, 30, and 31, 2009, and on january 14, 2010, flumerfelt did not see any children being dropped off or picked up at the 3714 address at the times written on the attendance records signed under penalty of perjury by sanford and hadley.25 25 on december 17, flumerfelt watched the 3714 address attendance record for december 2009 shows she dropped off her son at 6:21 a.m., and he was signed out at 8:00 a.m. on 47 children arrive at attendance records is evidence that the attendance records are false. without corroborating evidence, however, his testimony alone is not sufficient to support a perjury conviction under section 118, subdivision (b). the people identify no evidence we reverse hadley and s of perjury on count 58. b. insufficient evidence supports convictions on count 63 (conspiracy to commit perjury with hadley) count 63 alleged sanford conspired with hadley to commit perjury on or between may 1, 2009 and february 28, 2010. the three overt acts alleged were the submission of attendance december 30, flumerfelt watched the 3714 address from 4:15 p.m. to 6:40 p.m., and saw no activity at 4:30 p.m., when the attendance record shows sanford signed him out. on december 31, flumerfelt watched the house between 5:58 a.m. and 8:35 a.m., and saw no activity at 6:18 a.m., when the attendance record showed sanford signed her son in. on january 14, although flumerfelt watched the 3714 address between 4:59 a.m. and 6:32 a.m., he saw no activity at signed her son in. sanford signed the attendance record under penalty of perjury on february 5, however that was after the period alleged in the indictment ended, on january 31, 2010. the march 2009 attendance record cited by the people is also outside the time period specified in the information. 48 records for november and december of 2009 and january of 2010. for the november and december attendance records, the hours in november and 112 hours in december, taking annual leave and sick leave for the remainder of her paycheck. the people argue that sanford falsely certified under penalty of perjury on december 25, 2009 that she was working 40 hours a week, and, on january 5, 2010, that she needed child care for 521/2 supervisor, not sanford, signed an employment verification form under penalty of perjury stating that sanford was scheduled to work 40 hours a week. on january 5, 2010, sanford signed onfidential application for child care and certification of eligibility stating that her work schedule was five days a week from 6 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. her january 2010 signature on the application did not falsely certify how many hours sanford worked in november and december 2009. and again, neither document is evidence that hadley did not provide child care for the hours on the attendance sheets for schedule may have been. the people do not address the remaining overt act, the submission of the january 2010 attendance record. hadley and sanford signed the january attendance record on february 5, 2010, and flumerfelt testified that he did not see activity at 5:17 a.m. on january 14, 2010, when the attendance record shows sanford signed her son in. that is some evidence of a false entry on the attendance record, but as we explained above, no other 49 as is required for a conviction of perjury under section 118, subdivision (b). we reverse sanfordconviction, for conspiracy to commit perjury on count 63. c. the statute of limitations bars conviction on count 71 (petty theft) sanford argues that her conviction on count 71 was barred by the one-year statute of limitations for misdemeanors, and we agree. the complaint, filed april 30, 2012, named sanford with hadley in count 57, felony grand theft of $4,182 on or between may 1, 2009 and january 31, 2010. at the preliminary hearing arguing any overpayment would not exceed $500. on november 2, 2012, the magistrate granted the motion: court stated it would dismiss count 57 as to sanford and then add count 71 as a misdemeanor count. nevertheless, the original information, filed november 15, 2012, charged sanford and hadley with felony grand theft on or between may 1, 2009 and february 28, 2010 in count 57.26 an amended information, filed february 20, 2013, continued to charge sanford and hadley with felony grand theft in count 57. the trial court dismissed count 57 and added count 71 on february 6, 2014. that same date, the prosecutor filed an amended information adding count 71 for misdemeanor grand theft naming sanford only, and sanford entered a not guilty plea. 26 hadley does not appeal her conviction on count 35. 50 toward the end of trial, the prosecutor stated that the loss in count 71 was less than $950, and asked the court to reduce the charge of misdemeanor grand theft to petty theft. counsel moved to dismiss count 71 as outside the statute of limitations, and the court took the motion under advisement. the prosecutor represented that he had not been sure until a few days earlier that the amount was below $950. the fourth amended information, filed april 28, 2015, includes count 71, charging sanford with misdemeanor petty theft in violation of section 484, subdivision (a).27 the jury found sanford guilty on count 71. as we explained above, grand theft under section 487 is a 489, (wobbler) initially charged as a felony, the three-year statute of limitations for felonies applies, without regard to the ultimate reduction to a misdemeanor after the filing of the (people v. crabtree, supra, 169 cal.app.4th at pp. 13091310.) in which is a lesser and necessarily included offense of grand theft, the initial charge. (people v. shoaff (1993) 16 cal.app.4th 1112, 1116.) when a felony is reduced to a necessarily included misdemeanor rather than as a wobbler, the one-year statute of limitations for misdemeanors applies. (people v. mincey, supra, 2 cal.4th at p. 453.) the jury found sanford guilty of a misdemeanor as a necessarily included offense of the wobbler 27 in closing, the prosecutor argued sanford was responsible for $465.72 in losses for child care to which she was not entitled. 51 misdemeanor[ ] and no wobblers at all. (people v. mincey, supra, 2 cal.4th at p. 453.) because no wobbler offenses were involved at all, only the general misdemeanor statute of limitations applied. that general statute was one year, which term had already expired. (ibid.) [] the lesser included offense, regardless of the limitation of time a straight misdemeanor is found as a necessarily included offense people v. soni, supra, 134 cal.app.4th at pp. 15161517.) as the initial charge against sanford was a felony but her conviction was of a necessarily included misdemeanor, the one-year limitations period for misdemeanors applies. (people v. crabtree, supra, 169 cal.app.4th at p. 1310.) the discovery of the crime occurred in september 2009, when flumerfelt discovered the 5038 address was vacant; the prosecution began on april 30, 2012, long after the one-year limitations period expired. conviction on count 71. v. the admission of exhibit 3c was not an abuse of the the defendants argue that the trial court abused its exhibit photographs among 10 photographs of black women.28 the defense objected to the exhibit, which the court 28 in opening statement, the prosecutor argued that 10 people had been associated with this case; not all had been charged, and some were no longer part of the case. 52 counsel or defendants, responded that all the women had been involved in the case, and all the women, , originally had been charged. the photographs were relevant because in the deliberation room, the jurors could see which defendant the defense objection, stating that although the exhibit looked like a six-pack with 10 people, it was not overly prejudicial given its probative value under section 352. defense counsel argued it was irrelevant what the women looked like because some of them would not be in court, and the court responded that the prosecutor could use the photographs to prove identity. the prosecutor asked moore to identify the women in the photographs. moore testified her photograph was number 5 of the 10 photos, hadley was number 1, she did not recognize number 2, mcfadden was number 3, and murray was number 4. number 6 was a person named lakeshia, and moore did not number . valencia brooks testified her photograph was number 2, she did not know numbers 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7, identified number 8 as diona kemp, and confirmed that the prosecutor then continued with exhibits showing photographs of the four childcare locations. the prosecutor also used the photographs in his cross-examination of wells, who testified that she recognized mcfadden, murray, and sanford as mothers who childcare operation. in closing, 53 the prosecutor referred to the exhibit as evidence that not all the women knew each other, supporting the existence of separate conspiracies to obtain childcare money from crystal stairs. discretion whether to exclude relevant evidence whose probative on appeal, the defendants argue the arrangement of the photographs -exhibit was unduly inflammatory, associating the defendants with moore and brooks (who testified at trial). the photographs were relevant under evidence code section 210 as evidence tending logically to establish identity. offered to people v. scheid (1997) 16 cal.4th 1, 14.) even cumulative evidence may be relevant, and is admissible unless it is substantially more prejudicial than probative under evidence code section 352. (scheid, at p. 15.) photographs may be admitted to help the jury keep track of individuals in a case, if the photographs are not unduly prejudicial. (people v. suff (2014) 58 cal.4th 1013, 10721073.) here, the photographs had probative value to support the pwith women who did not necessarily know each other, and to help the jury keep track of the defendants and witnesses. as to whether the exhibit had a prejudicial effect, the evoke an emotional bias against a party as an individual, while having only slight probative vpeople v. 54 scheid, supra, 16 cal.4th at p. 19.) although the expressions are unsmiling on all but two of the faces in the photographs, the serious expressions do not invoke an emotional bias against the defendants outweig value to prove the childcare funds.

(id. at p. 1010.) we are troubled in opening statement. that racialized term carries negative used when he was growing up to describe a woman who collected welfare while staying home caring for her children, and explained that welfare reform set aside taxpayer money for child care so those women could work. while this background could help the jury understand the source of the money administered by crystal 30 was wrong. all 30 amounts of welfare money by fraud.
