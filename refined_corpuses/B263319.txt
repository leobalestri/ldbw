(a)). a preliminary hearing was held on december 29, 2014. an information, filed on january 12, 2015, alleged one count of grand theft of personal 1 all undesignated statutory references are to the penal code. 2 miranda v. arizona (1966) 384 u.s. 436, 474. 3 property ( 487, subd. (a)) and two prior convictions within the meaning of section 667.5, subdivision (b).3 sutton waived further arraignment on the information. on march 18, 2015, a jury found sutton not guilty of grand theft but guilty of the lesser offense of petty theft ( 484, subd. (a)). on april 6, 2015, the trial court deemed the information amended to allege count 1 as a misdemeanor ( 17, subd. (b)). the court then found, based on the misdemeanor conviction, that sutton, who was on probation at the time he committed the theft, was in violation of probation. the court sentenced sutton to 180 days in jail for the petty theft, concurrent to four years imposed for iolation of probation. the court imposed a $40 court security fee ( 1465.8); a $30 criminal conviction fee (gov. code,  70373); and a $150 restitution fine ( 1202.4). discussion -appointed counsel filed an opening brief which raised no issues and which asked this court to conduct an independent review of the record, under people v. wende (1979) 25 cal.3d 436, 441. by letter dated september 29, 2015, we advised appellant that he had 30 days to submit by brief or letter any contentions or argument he wished this court to consider. sutton submitted a letter, filed on october 15, 2015. sutton raises two issues. he first contends his due process rights were violated because h ( 825 [a defendant arrested pursuant to a warrant must be arraigned within 48 hours of arrest].) on this record, the case was filed on november 25, 2014. a preliminary hearing was held on december 29, 2014. the record does not show when sutton was arraigned. but an information was filed on january 12, 2015, and sutton waived further arraignment that same day. although the record does not show have the case dismissed or sutton released on the ground that sutton was not arraigned 3 the information was amended to allege three prior convictions ( 667.5, subd. (b)). 4 within 48 hours of arrest.4 judge scott gordon denied the motion. when the issue was raised again, judge wapner found that any delay did not prejudice sutton. a mere delay in arraignment does not immunize a defendant from prosecution. (dragna v. white (1955) although it will subject the offending person to liability for so much of the imprisonment as occurs after the period of nelozoya v. superior court (1987) 189 cal.app.3d 1332, 1345; people v. valenzuela (1978) 86 cal.app.3d 427, 430.) in any event, defendant must show that any delay prejudiced him. (valenzuela, at pp. 431-432.) sutton failed to show such prejudice. his trial counsel submitted a verbal motion regarding the arraignment issue without any a defendant raising a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must show both that s performance was deficient and that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. (strickland v. washington (1984) 466 u.s. 668; people v. ledesma (1987) 43 cal.3d 171, 217-218.) counseormance was not deficient because he made a motion orally rather than in writing. there is also no showing the oral motion prejudiced sutton. we have examined the record and are satisfied attorney has fully complied with the responsibilities of counsel and no arguable issue exists. (people v. kelly (2006) 40 cal.4th 106, 126; people v. wende, supra, 25 cal.3d at p. 441.) 4 the record does not reference a motion under section 825, but there is no dispute one was made. 5 disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports aldrich, acting p. j. we concur: lavin, j. jones, j. judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
