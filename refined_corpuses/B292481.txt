manslaughter of jesus pimentel. the jury found true an allegation that orellana used a knife in the killing. on appeal, orellana contends the trial court violated his confrontation clause rights by admitting the testimony of a autopsy. orellana also argues the court erred in instructing the jury on false statements and flight, and that those form instructions misstate the law. finally, orellana asserts he was entitled to a hearing on his ability to pay a court fine and fees. ce. facts and procedural background 1. pimentel is stabbed to death around 7:45 p.m. on the evening of october 25, 2015, ery reyes was walking down maine avenue in long beach. a manlater identified as jesus pimentelcame out of a nearby alley, holding the left side of his chest with both hands. reyes saw blood.

on his back with a stab wound on the left side of his chest. abuhabwan saw a large pool of blood. abuhabwan relieved reyes of his life-saving efforts and continued to apply pressure to pimentel and took him to the hospital. officer ernesto perez searched the area and found an eight and a half-inch butcher knife. 3 in the meantime, around 8:22 p.m. that night, officers juan ortiz and robert torres went to the area of anaheim street and cedar avenue a orellana came out of the restaurant and walked toward the officers. a knife in his satchel. the officers arrested orellana.1 pimentel died. an autopsy revealed he had suffered his heart and left lung. 2. orellana tells detectives his version of what happened about two weeks after the homicide, detectives interviewed orellana in an interrogation room at the jail. detective oscar valenzuelawho speaks spanishinterpreted for his fellow detectives and orellana. orellana told the detectives that, on the afternoon of the day orellana had found two knives in a trash bin. at some point orellana went to a nearby laundromat. when he returned to the park, it was starting to get dark. the same group was still there. they started saying they were sureos, from barrio pobre and 18th street. a man orellana 1 witnesses described an incident after 8:00 p.m. that nightseparate and apart from the pimentel stabbinginvolving a victim named cesar antonio herrera lopez. herrera there had been another attack by orellana a day or two earlier. the people charged orellana with two counts of assault with a deadly weapon on herrera. the jury acquitted orellana on those counts. 4 snide arrived with another man. orellana referred to snide as and ,meaning pimentel. orellana had found a cell phone and he showed it to pimentel. pimentel asked orellana if he was selling the phone and orellana said yes. pimentel offered to pay orellana in methamphetamine but orellana said he wanted cash. pimentel agreed to give orellana $40 for the phone. pimentel had orellana follow him to a nearby table. another man there, who told pimentelwho by that time had the phonepimentelof the park, saying if they saw him again th admitted, however, that he never saw pimentel with a weapon. pimentel asked orellana if he wanted a beer. pimentel went to buy the beer and orellana waited in an alley for him to return. eventually pimentel orellana followed pimentel to an area behind some apartments. pimentel pimentel was as into [pimentelorellana stabbed pimentel. orellana told 3. the jury convicted orellana of voluntary manslaughter as a lesser crime to murder. the jury found true the allegation that, in the commission of the crime, orellana personally used a deadly 5 and dangerous weapon. the trial court sentenced orellana to 12 years in the state prison: the upper term of 11 years for the offense and one additional year for the weapon use. the court imposed a restitution fine of $300, a court operations assessment of $40, and a criminal conviction assessment of $30.2 the court stayed a parole revocation restitution fine of $300. counsel did not object to the fine or any of the fees. discussion 1. confrontation clause rights orellana contends the trial courtin admitting the autopsyimproperly admitted testimonial, case-specific hearsay. we disagree. a. the testimony of deputy medical examiner dr. pedro ortiz on the first day of trial, the prosecutor told the court he had learned only several days earlier that the coroner who , dr. poukens, was so, the prosecutor said, he planned to call a substitute coroner. related to the autopsy report from any medical examiner or 3 the trial court denied t, that has been 2 the court also ordered orellana to reimburse the arresting agency for $266.52 in booking fees. orellana does not challenge this fee on appeal. 3 the record on appeal does not include this written motion. 6 dr. pedro ortiz testified he had been a deputy medical ortiz had performed about 7,000 autopsies. ortiz had read the . it included an anatomic summary and 40 photographs of the autopsy. for the jury. he also defined defensive wounds, and testified he did not see anprosecutor displayed for the jury a photograph of the body, ortiz spersonnel. testifying about a close-chest, ortiz estimated the stab wound was about one inch long and a quarter inch wide. ortiz stated thatbased on his review of the file, reports, and photographsin his opinion pimentel experienced copious bleeding after the heart and left lung were s on cross-examination ortiz testified pimentel had amphetamine (the metabolite of methamphetamine) as well as of marijuana in his system. the court [e]ffects that amphetamine and b. the controlling authorities the sixth amendment to the federal constitution gives a criminal defendant the right to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses. (people v. lopez (2012) 55 cal.4th 569, 576.) in the seminal case of crawford v. washington (2004) 541 u.s. at trial of a testimonial out-of-court statement against a criminal 7 defendant unless the maker of the statement is unavailable to testify at trial and the defendant had a prior opportunity for cross-lopez, at pp. 576, 580-581.) crawford and the high court has not articulated one on which a majority of the justices agree. (people v. sanchez (2016) 63 cal.4th 665, 687 (sanchez); people v. leon (2015) 61 cal.4th 569, 602-603 (leon).) it must be made with some degree of formality or solemnity, and its primary purpose must pertain in some way to a criminal prosecution. (people v. edwards (2013) 57 cal.4th 658, 705; leon, at p. 603.) confrontation clause claim. (people v. hopson (2017) 3 cal.5th 424, 431.) both the united states supreme court and our california supreme court have addressed the application of crawford to forensic reports. (see melendez-diaz v. massachusetts (2009) 557 u.s. 305; bullcoming v. new mexico (2011) 564 u.s. 647.) in several cases, our state high court has considered whether a pathologist may testify about statements in an autopsy report prepared by another, nontestifying pathologist. in people v. dungo (2012) 55 cal.4th 608 (dungo), the court held factual a nontestifying pathologist and recorded in an autopsy report, were not testimonial because they lacked formality and criminal investigation was not the autopsid. at pp. 619-621.) the court distinguished statements describing anatomical and physiological observations from statements id. at pp. 619-620.) the dungo id. at p. 619.) so the testifying 8 the conditiphotographs, did not give defendant a right to confront and cross-id. at p. 621.) in people v. leon, the court explained: the admission of autopsy photographs, and competent testimony based on such photographs, does not violate the confrontation clause. . . . it is also clear that testimony relating the testifying ently conceived opinion is not objectionable, even if that opinion is based on inadmissible hearsay. . . . the hearsay problem arises when an expert simply recites portions of a report prepared by someone else, or when such a report is itself admitted intleon, supra, 61 cal.4th at p. 603, italics omitted; see also people v. gonzalez (2019) 34 cal.app.5th 1081, 1090.) people v. sanchez, supra, 63 cal.4th 665, considered gang expert testimony, not autopsy reports. but its analysis is relevant. sanchez explained that, case-specific out-of-court statements to explain the bases for his opinion, those statements are necessarily considered by the jury id. at p. 684.) noted during the autopsy of a suspected homicide victim would be a case-id. at p. 677.) however, an expert may in rules or the confrontation clause. (id. at p. 685, italics omitted; people v. perez (2018) 4 cal.5th 421, 456 (perez).) in the 2018 cases of people v. perez and people v. garton (2018) 4 cal.5th 485 (garton), our supreme court held 9 nontestifying pathologists did not constitute reversible error. in people v. perezhemorrhaging in the vict-specific facts about the constituted hearsay under sanchez. (perez, supra, 4 cal.5th at p. dungoperez concluded any federal constitutional error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. (ibid.) it was undisputed the victim had been choked and stabbed, and the depth of the stab wounds, the eye hemorrhages, and the details of the internal guilt determination. (id. at p. 457.) nor was it error for the testifying pathologist to rely on hearsay in forming his opinion about the cause of death. (ibid.) people v. garton opinionsbased on an autopsy report a retired coroner had preparedwere not objectionable insofar as the testifying coroner did not directly or implicitly convey any statements the nontestifying coroner had made. (garton, supra, 4 cal.5th at pp. 504, 506.) without mentioning dungo, garton reasoned statements made in the autopsy report and related by the -of-court statements to the jury because the autopsy report contained the out-of-court statements of [the nontestifying coroner]. . . . because these facts garton, at p. 506.) but garton concluded that, even if those statements were testimonial, any error was harmless beyond a reasonable 10 the manner in which she died were undisputed. (id. at p. 507.) c. testimony did not violate the sixth amendment. dr. ortiz testified he had looked at 40 photographs from the autopsy. four of those photographs were marked as exhibits and with a clearly visible wound to the right of his left nipple, about halfway between the nipple and the center of his chest. two close-up photographs show the length and width of the wound. if wound, dr. ortiz did not relate that information. dr. ortiz did testify a even if this were testimonial hearsay, jurors could use their own common knowledge to conclude that, if someone is stabbed in the left chest with a large moreover, first responder officer abuhabwanwho was present at trial and subject to cross-examinationtestified he rge pool of detective scott laschwho testified at trial as welltold puncture wound to the left part of his chest just to the right of part of the autopsy. in addition, orellana himself told the police he had stabbed pimentel in the chest with one of the two knives he had found, and he confirmed the knife officer perez found nearby that night was that knife. jurors saw photos of the eight and one-half inch knife. here, as in perez and gartonbody and the manner in which [he] (garton, supra, 4 cal.5th at p. 507; perez, supra, 4 cal.5th at p. the hearsay 11 statements, such as photographs and police testimony, showed that someone had choked [the victim] and stabbed her multiple much less distinguishesdungo, leon, perez, and garton.4 orellana asic] testimony, the jury may have found that there was insufficient evidence that appellant statements are mysterious. as we have said, orellana told the police he stabbed pimentel. this is not a whodunit. nor is there any orellana also y determine whether he acted in reasonable or unreasonable self-defense. this argument also is meritless. the trial court instructed the jurors with calcrim nos. 505 and 571self-defense and imperfect self-defense, respectively. in convicting orellana of the lesser offense of voluntary manslaughter, the jurors presumably found he acted in imperfect self-defensethat is, with a sincere but unreasonable belief that he faced an imminent deadly threat and that the immediate use of deadly force was necessary. (see calcrim no. 571.) 4 as we noted, under people v. dungo, factual observations (dungo, supra, 55 cal.4th at pp. 619, 621.) although our supreme court did not rely on dungo in its 2018 decisions in people v. perez and people v. garton, the court has not repudiated or overruled dungo, and we are bound by it. (auto equity sales, inc. v. superior court (1962) 57 cal.2d 450, 455.) 12 as for ordinary self-defense, orellana never told the detectives that pimentel attacked him or even touched him. instead, he told them pimentel his withwithwith his hand. and thenuhwas gonna take out, if a knife ororor something, i reacted first able touhuh several opportunities to get away from pimentel. even after pimentel and his gang member companions told orellana they were going to beat or kill him, orellana waited for pimentel to return from the liquor store and then followed him to the area behind the apartments. no reasonable jury could have found on the evidence in this case that orellana acted in perfect self-defense. condition of the cause and manner of death was based on his own conclusions, drawn from photographic evidence and dr. s report. this testimony confrontation clause rights. photographs, and expert conclusions drawn from them, are not hearsay. (leon, supra, 61 cal.4th at p. 603.) as justice liu noted in garton, autopsy photographs are not hearsay because they are not out-of-court statements: only people can make hearsay statements; machines cannot.(garton, supra, 4 cal.5th on hearsay in formulating his opinions did not run afoul of the confrontation clause. (perez, supra, 4 cal.5th at p. 457, citing sanchez, supra, 63 cal.4th at p. 685 and evid. code,  802.) 13 2. calcrim nos. 362 and 372 are accurate statements of the law and the trial court did not err in giving them orellana contends the trial court erred in instructing the jury with calcrim nos. 362 (consciousness of guilt: false violation r. the form jury instructions published by the judicial council of california and embodied in calcrim have been on the books for many years. they are constantly updated by the advisory committee on criminal jury instructions. we examine the jury instructions as a whole, in light of the trial record, to determine whether it is reasonably likely the jury understood the challenged instruction in a way that undermined the presumption of innocence or tended to relieve the prosecution people v. paysinger (2009) 174 cal.app.4th 26, 30.) a. calcrim no. 362 calcrim no. 362 is the successor to caljic no. 2.03, sistently upheld . . people v. mcgowan (2008) 160 cal.app.4th 1099, 1103 & fn. 3.) are minor differences between caljic no. 2.03 and calcrim no. 362 . . . , none is sufficient to undermine our id. at p. 1104.) arrest are admissiblenot for the truth of the statementsbut to people v. kimble (1988) 44 cal.3d -arrest statement was false, jurors may consider its inconsistency with 14 the testimony of other witnesses and physical evidence. (id. at pp. 497-498.) in his closing argument, the prosecutor told the jury there (s) he a passerby walking down maine but raiwho came out of a nearby house, then took from behind that looked like a 9-millimeter gun. the prosecutor noted orellana told the police reyes had left the scene with the gun, but both reyes and abuhabwan testified at trial that reyes was still there, applying 5 orellana also told the detectives that, after stabbing pimentel with the prosecutor noted orellana told four different stories about why he did that. on this record, the trial court did not err in giving the jury calcrim no. 362. whether what orellana told the detectives was innocent misrecollection or a purposeful misstatement was for the jury to decide. b. calcrim no. 372 appellate courts also have upheld calcrim no. 372as well as its predecessor, caljic no. 2.52against constitutional challenge. (people v. mendoza (2000) 24 cal.4th 130, 179-181; people v. price (2017) 8 cal.app.5th 409, 454-458; people v. paysinger, supra, 174 cal.app.4th at pp. 29-30.) b]ecause the gang orellana used his remaining 5 police found no firearms at the scene. 15 knife to cut off the legs of his pants after he ran away. he threw orellana denied that his alteration of his pants had anything to do with changing his appearance. it is undisputed orellana did not remain at the scene until police arrived. again, whether orellana ran away because he feared the arrival of gang membersan arrival that apparently never happenedor to avoid detection and arrest was for the jury to determine. 3. orellana is not entitled to an ability to pay hearing as noted, the trial court imposed a restitution fine of $300 and $70 in court fees. citing people v. dueas (2019) 30 cal.app.5th 1157 (dueas)not holding a hearing about his ability to pay that fine and the fees. we disagree. first, some courtsincluding our colleagues in division twohave held dueas was wrongly decided. (people v. hicks (2019) 40 cal.app.5th 320, review granted nov. 26, 2019, s258946. see also people v. aviles (2019) 39 cal.app.5th 1055. cf. people v. caceres (2019) 39 cal.app.5th 917, 926-927 dueas; concluding in any event dueas does not justify extending the issue is now before our supreme court. (people v. kopp, review granted nov. 13, 2019, s257844.) second, as noted, orellana did not object to the fine or fees at sentencing. accordingly, he has forfeited any challenge. (people v. bipialaka (2019) 34 cal.app.5th 455, 464; people v. frandsen (2019) 33 cal.app.5th 1126, 1153; but see people v. castellano (2019) 33 cal.app.5th 485, 488-489.) 16 third, the facts in dueas were very different from those here. dueas was a homeless, disabled woman who had committed traffic violations. (dueas, supra, 30 cal.app.5th at pp. 1160-1162.) orellanaunlike dueasdoes not face incarceration because of an inability to pay a restitution fine and assessments. orellana is in prison because he stabbed pimentel in the heart, killing him. fourth, orellana has presented no evidence of an inability wages (people v. johnson (2019) 35 cal.app.5th pay [$370] while serving a [12]-year prison sentence is (ibid.) disposition not to be published in the official reports egerton, j. i concur: edmon, p. j. lavin, j., concurring and dissenting under people v. sanchez (2016) 63 cal.4th 665, the error was harmless. (see people v. flint (2018) 22 cal.app.5th 983, 10041006.) i also agree that the challenged jury instructions are accurate statements of the law and the trial court did not err in giving them. forfeited any challenge to the imposition of the court facilities fee (gov. code,  70373), the court security fee (pen. code,  1465.8), and the restitution fine (pen. code,  1202.4, subd. (b)) by failing to object in the lower court. people v. dueas, which held that mandatory fines and fees could not constitutionally be imposed on criminal defendants unable to pay them, represented a sea change in the law of fines and fees in california. (people v. dueas (2019) 30 cal.app.5th 1157, 11691172; see people v. brooks (2017) 3 cal.5th [r]eviewing courts have traditionally excused parties for failing to raise an issue at trial where an objection would have been futile or wholly unsupported to pay the challenged fees and fine. (see people v. rodriguez (2019) 34 cal.app.5th 641, 645.) accordingly, i would remand this matter for the limited purpose of allowing orellana to assert his inability to pay the assessed fees and fine. (people v. castellano (2019) 33 cal.app.5th 485, 490491; accord, people v. viera (2005) 35 cal.4th 264, 305306 [where defendant was ordered to pay a restitution fine at a time when court could not 2 consider his ability to pay, defendant was entitled to remand so the court could consider his ability to pay under current statutory criteria].) i would also hold that if, on remand, the prosecution stay the restitution fine and strike the feesthe best result defendant could obtain after a contested hearing. (see people v. viera, supra, 35 cal.4th at p. 306 [ordering trial court to reduce restitution fine to statutory minimum if ability to pay is uncontested on remand]; people v. wall (2017) 3 cal.5th 1048, of restitution on remand, he should so inform the trial court in writing with notice to [defendant]. in that event, the court shall lavin, j.
