(a))1 with a special allegation he had suffered two prior serious or violent  667, subds. (b)-(i); 1170.12, subds. (a)-(d)). silver pleaded not guilty and denied the special allegation. represented by appointed counsel, silver agreed to plead no contest to both charges and to admit one of the two prior strike allegations. in accordance with the terms of the negotiated agreement, on january 31, 2012 silver was sentenced to an aggregate state prison term of 10 years: six years (the lower term of three years doubled under the three strikes law) on one count and a consecutive term of four years (one-third the middle term of six years doubled under the three strikes law) on the second count. the court ordered silver to pay a $40 court operations assessment and a $30 criminal conviction assessment on each count, a $300 sex offender fine and a $600 restitution fine. the court imposed and suspended a parole revocation fine pursuant to section 1202.45. awarded a total of 507 days of presentence custody credit (441 actual days and 66 days of conduct credit). 1 statutory references are to the penal code. 3 discussion 1. the trial court erred in failing to impose certain mandatory penalty assessments when sentencing silver, the trial court ordered him to pay a $300 sex offender fine pursuant to section 290.3, subdivision (a).2 the court did not mention any related penalty assessments in its oral pronouncement of judgment. nonetheless, the minute order entered following the sentencing hearing, as well as the abstract of judgment, reflect the cdoes not dispute the calculation of the penalty assessments or claim an inability to pay the fine, silver argues the $840 in penalty assessments should be stricken to conform to the oral pronouncement of judgment. generally, when there is a discrepancy between the oral pronouncement of judgment and the minute order of the judgment, the oral pronouncement controls. (people v. mitchell (2001) 26 cal.4th 181, 185-186; see people v. zackery (2007) 147 pronouncement of judgment and the minute order or the abstract of judgment, the oral nt is required to pay the fine prescribed by section 290.3, subdivision (a), it is jurisdictional error not to impose the mandatory penalties and surcharges established by section 1464, subdivision (a), and government code section 76000, subdivision (a), and related provisions.
