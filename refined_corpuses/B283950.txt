(b)(1)). the people alleged that defendant e meaning of our three strikes law ( 667, subds. (b)-(j) & 1170.12, subds. (a)-(d)). the people further alleged that defendant had served eight prior prison terms for felonies ( 667.5, subd. (b)); among them was the 2010 drug conviction. following a trial that ended with a hung jury, the people and defendant entered into a plea agreement: defendant would enter a no contest plea to a newly added count of assault with a deadly weapon ( 245, subd. (a)(1)), admit one of his strikes, and 1 all further statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise indicated. 3 admit the 2010 drug conviction as a prior prison term; the people would dismiss the other charges and allegations. the trial court on march 23, 2016. the court then imposed the agreed-upon sentence of five years, comprised of four years for the assault (two years, doubled due to the prior strike) plus one year for the prior prison term. defendant did not appeal his conviction or sentence. about six weeks later, on may 6, 2016, the trial court his 2010 felony drug conviction as a misdemeanor. in march 2017, defendant filed a motion asking the trial court to strike the one-year prior prison term enhancement based upon his 2010 drug conviction because it was no longer a felony. the trial court denied his motion. defendant filed this timely appeal. discussion drug- and theft-felony until a court reduces them to a misdemeanor) and ultimately sentenced as felonies.2 (people v. lynall (2015) 233 cal.app.4th 1102, 1108.) proposition 47 entitled defendant to seek redesignation of his 2010 felony drug conviction, and he obtained that relief in may 2016. but does proposition 47 entitle him to the further relief of having his march 2016 sentence reduced because the 2010 conviction is now a misdemeanor and 2 these redesignated offenses can be found in sections 459.5, 473, 476a, 490.2, 496, and 666, as well as in health and safety code sections 11350, 11357, and 11377. ( 1170.18, subds. (a) & (b).) 4 section 667.5, subdivision (b)? (see  667.5, subd. (b) [applies to in buycks, supra, 2018 cal. lexis 5486, our supreme court buycks mandate that a redesignated offensin conjunction with the mandate of in re estrada (1965) 63 cal.2d 740 (estrada) that legislative acts that mitigate punishment are presumed to apply retroactively to absent a legislative declaration to the contrary, means that felony convictions redesignated as misdemeanors under proposition 47 may not be used as an enhancement under section 667.5, l when proposition buycks, at pp. *14-*27.) buycks is not directly on point with this case because, unlike in buycks, defendant here committed his crime after proposition 47 took effect (and thus his case was not even pendinglet alone finalwhen proposition 47 took effect). but s rationale nevertheless dictates reversal. buycks rests in part on s presumption that laws that ameliorate sentences are to be given retroactive effect to nonfinal sentences. 2010 felony drug conviction was redesignated as a misdemeanor on may 6, 2016, because the 90 days he had to file a petition for certiorari after his march 23, 2016 sentencing had yet to expire.3 3 in light of these facts, we have no occasion to consider how buycks would apply when a defendant is convicted and sentenced after proposition 47 has taken effect, and where a felony used as 5 (see people v. kemp (1974) 10 cal.3d 611, 614 [a conviction becomes of appeal [is] exhausted, and the time for is therefore entitled to vacation of the section 667.5, subdivision (b) enhancement and to a resentencing. disposition the order is reversed, and the trial court is ordered to section 667.5, subdivision (b) enhancement and to resentence defendant. not to be published in the official reports. ______________________, j. hoffstadt we concur: _________________________, acting p. j. ashmann-gerst _________________________, j. chavez an enhancement in that case is not redesignated until after the
