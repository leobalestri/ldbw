(pen. code,  4573, subd. (a); health & saf. code,  11377.) the information also alleged eleven prison priors and one prior strike conviction. (pen. code,  667.5; 667, subd. (d); 1170.12, subd. (b).) pursuant to a plea agreement, appellant pled no contest to count 1 and admitted his prior strike conviction; he was sentenced to four years in prison, consisting of a low term of two years, which was doubled because of the strike conviction. count 2 was dismissed. appellant was allowed to file a late notice of appeal and to seek a certificate of probable cause. his request for the certificate was denied. in his supplemental letter, appellant claims his attorney advised him that the people had offered a two-year deal in exchange for a guilty plea to the possession charge in count 2, and the court abused its discretion in refusing to strike his prior strike conviction under people v. superior court (romero) (1996) 13 cal.4th 497. ahe was asked to plead to count 1 (bringing contraband into jail) and to admit his prior strike conviction, which is what he did in open court. his attorney acknowledged in appethat appellant was offered a four-year deal, and appellant received the agreed-upon sentence. before appellant accepted the plea deal, the court denied his request to strike the strike conviction because of his extensive criminal record and the amount of drugs he allegedly had brought into jail. plea. a certificate of probable cause is required to challenge the validity of a plea, including the imposition of an agreed-upon sentence. (people v. french (2008) 43 cal.4th 36, 4344.) the denial of such a certificate is reviewable only by timely petition for a writ of mandate. (people v. castelan (1995) 32 cal.app.4th 1185, 1188.) appellant 3 has not challenged the denial of the certificate, and we see no reason to construe this appeal as a petition for a writ of mandate. (see in re brown (1973) 9 cal.3d 679, 683.) his claims are, therefore, not cognizable on appeal. we have reviewed the record under people v. kelly (2006) 40 cal.4th 106. no arguable issues for appeal exist. disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports epstein, p.j. we concur: manella, j. collins, j.
