( 496, subd. (1).) in july 2015, booker filed an application to have his felony conviction designated as a misdemeanor because the value of the property he received was not more than $950. ( 1170.18, subd. (f).) included no attachment or statement of facts, but the trial court allowed his counsel to supplement the application with argument referencing the preliminary hearing transcript and probation report. argued that the preliminary hearing testimony explained how the police were able to trace the xbox to booker but that no similar testimony was provided for the computer. likewise, counsel argued that the probation report showed the victim recovered the xbox, but not the computer, calling into question whether booker ever received the computer given that it was never recovered. moreover, counsel argued there was no 1 all statutory references are to the penal code. 3 discussion at the plea hearing about which stolen items booker had received. thus, booker argued the trial court should consider only the value of the xbox (which was less than $950) and not the value of the computer (which was more than $950). noting booker had entered a no contest plea to count 5 of the information, which listed the stolen property to be an xbox and a computer, the trial court concluded he had failed to meet his burden of demonstrating the value of the stolen property did not exceed $950. the trial court denied the application. booker filed a timely notice of appeal. discussion on appeal, booker contends the record did not establish the value of the stolen property and his no contest plea did not admit he received both the xbox and the computer. on november 4, 2014, california voters passed proposition 47, the safe neighborhoods and schools act, which reduces certain nonserious and nonviolent crimes, such as low-level drug- and theft-related offenses, from felonies to misdemeanors. (people v. contreras (2015) 237 cal.app.4th 868, 889-890.) proposition 47 authorizes a person who has completed his or her sentence for a felony conviction and who would have been guilty of a misdemeanor under the act to file an application to have the felony conviction designated as a misdemeanor. ( 1170.18, subd. (f); see  1170.18, subd. (a) [resentencing to a misdemeanor sections 11350, 11357, or 11377 of the health and safety code, or section 459.5, 473, 476a, 490.2, 496, or 666 of the penal code, as those sections have been amended or added by this act.) proposition 47 makes receipt of stolen property a f the property does not exceed . . . $950. ( 496, subd. (a).) booker acknowledges he has the burden of proof as to the value of the property in order to obtain relief under section 1170.18.
