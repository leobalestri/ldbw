(a)), because the sentencing scheme under the one strike law did not apply to the crime of continuous sexual abuse at the time defendant committed the offense. we rejected the remainder of defendants contentions and remanded the matter for resentencing. after defendant was resentenced, he filed the instant appeal. finding no error, we affirm. background given that this appeal involves only the sentence defendant received after remand, a review of the facts is unnecessary. on april 30, 2013, the trial court conducted a sentencing hearing. as it did when it initially sentenced defendant, the court imposed six consecutive 15-year-to-life terms. for the continuous sexual abuse count, it sentenced defendant to a concurrent 12-year term. this appeal followed. discussion defendants appointed counsel filed a brief raising no issues and asked this court to independently review the record pursuant to people v. wende (1979) 25 cal.3d 436. counsel submitted a declaration stating he had advised defendant of the nature of the brief that would be filed. on august 27, 2013, we sent a letter to defendant advising him that he had 30 days within which to file a supplemental brief raising any issues he wished for us to consider. to date, we have received no response. 3 we have independently reviewed the record. we are satisfied that no arguable issues exist and that defendant has, by virtue of counsels compliance with the wende procedure and our independent review of the record, received effective appellate review of the judgment entered against him.
