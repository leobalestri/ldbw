(c)(2))1, as to rosemary (count 1) and maya (count 12); (2) human sex trafficking of a minor ( 236.1, subd. (c)(1)), as to daisha (count 9), emoni (count 6), kianna (count 8), and jonathan (count 7); (3) pandering by procuring a minor under the age of 16 to be a prostitute ( 266i, subd. (b)(2)), as to daisha (count 19); (4) pandering by procuring a minor age 16 or over ( 266i, subd. (b)(1)), as to rosemary (count 13), maya (count 23), emoni (count 17), kianna (count 21), and jonathan (count 18); (5) pimping a minor under the age of 16 ( 266h, subd. (b)(2)), as to daisha (count 20)); (6) pimping a minor age 16 or over ( 266h, subd. (b)(1)), as to rosemary (count 14), maya (count 24), and kianna (count 22); (7) assault by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury ( 254, subd. (a)(4)), for assaulting rosemary with a belt (count 2); and (8) kidnapping ( 207, subd. (a)), for ordering rosemary into the car at gunpoint (count 3).2 b. trial and verdict the matter proceeded to a jury trial. at the close of 1 all further statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise indicated. 2 this information did not allege a count 10 or 11, and the people dismissed counts 4, 5, 15 and 16 (which involved two other victims) prior to submitting the case to the jury. 6 acquittal on the kidnapping charge. the jury was unable to reach a verdict on two countsnamely, the human sex trafficking count involving jonathan (count 7) and the pandering count involving kianna (count 21). the jury returned guilty verdicts on the remaining 15 counts. c. sentencing the trial court sentenced defendant to prison for 30 years to life. this sentence was comprised of 15 years to life on each of the human trafficking counts involving rosemary (count 1) and maya (count 12), to be served consecutively. the court imposed concurrent sentences on five other countsnamely, four-year concurrent sentences on the assault count against rosemary (count 2) and the pandering count involving jonathan (count 18); a six-year concurrent sentence on the human trafficking count involving emoni (count 6); and eight-year concurrent sentences on the human trafficking counts involving kianna (count 8) and daisha (count 9). the court stayed the sentence on the remaining counts (counts 13, 14, 17, 19, 20, 22, 23, and 24) under section 654. the trial court awarded defendant 796 days for actual time served but did not award any presentence conduct credit on the theory that the court had not imposed any determinate sentences. d. appeal defendant filed a timely notice of appeal. discussion i. sufficiency of the evidence defendant argues his conviction for human sex trafficking involving kianna (count 8) must be overturned because it rests on insufficient evidence. in evaluating the sufficiency of the 7 evidencethat is, evidence which is reasonable, credible, and of solid valuesuch that a reasonable trier of fact could find the people v. clark (2011) 52 cal.4th 856, 942 (clark).) in undertaking this to ibid.) the human sex trafficking charge involving kianna. to convict a defendant of this charge, a jury must find that (1) defendant or attempt[ed] to cause, among other things, pimping or pandering by procuring. ( 236.1, subd. (c).) here, the jury heathe preliminary hearing that (1) she worked as a prostitute for $500 per night.3 the jury heard from the detective who interviewed kianna prior to that testimony that she picked defendant out of a photospread. and the jury heard evidence other charges in this case, including some from juvenile hall (either directly or through an intermediary like rosemary); that rosemary and kianna met when rosemary was one of . 3 kianna did not appear at trial, and the trial court ruled that the people had exercised reasonable diligence in trying to secure her appearance. defendant does not challenge that finding on appeal. 8 (people v. kraft (2000) 23 cal.4th 978, 1030-offenses in this case were sufficiently similar to each other to evid. code,  1101, subd. (b); people v. villatoro (2009) 54 cal.4th misconduct . . . but also to evidence (already admitted) of charged people v. mendoza (2001) 52 cal.4th 1056, 1094 [no limiting instruction required for other act evidence unless requested].) taken together, the jury could reasonably infer that defendant pimp for whom she worked. defendant raises what boil down to three arguments in response. first, defendant asserts that kianna, in her preliminary hearing testimony, denied that he was her pimp or even having a pimp at all. however, the jury was within its rights to accept prostitute, had a trap, and picked defendant out of a photospread) but reject other parts (namely, that she had no stevens v. park, davis & co. (1973) 9 cal.3d 51, 67-68; calcrim no. 226.) second, defendant contends that we may not consider, as during her pre-preliminary hearing interview that (1) defendant was her pimp for two years, and (2) she picked him out of the photospread as the man who was her pimp. we may not consider them, defendant notes, because the trial court admitted them not as substantive evidence. defendant is right that the trial 9 court instructed the jury to consider the statements kianna made during her interview only for impeachment, and that an appellate court may not consider evidence admitted for impeachment when evaluating the sufficiency of the evidence. (people v. lewis (2001) 25 cevidence review involves assessment by the courts of whether the evidence adduced at trial could support any rational added)].) however, as the above stated analysis indicates, there statements. human sex trafficking count involving kianna is irreconcilably inability to reach a verdict on the count alleging that defendant pandered by procuring kianna (count 21), and thus narrows the universe of evidence we may consider in evaluating the sufficiency of the evidence. this position lacks merit because, as the united states supreme court (yeager v. united states (2009) 557 u.s. 110, 124-125; cf. mitchell v. prunty (9th cir. 1997) 107 f.3d 1337, 1339-1340 [court should evaluating sufficiency of the evidence] overruled on other grounds in santamaria v. horsley (9th cir. 1998) 133 f.3d 1242, 1248; people v. medina (1995) 39 cal.app.4th 643, 651-652 [same, as to acquittals on other counts].) 10 ii. evidentiary rulings rulings. we review these rulings for an abuse of discretion. (people v. powell (2018) 5 cal.5th 921, 961.) a. battery 1. pertinent facts during his cross-examination of daisha, defendant sought to impeach her with a juvenile adjudication for simple battery against her mother that dearlier. those charges occurred when, after repeated beatings by impeachment evidence because (1) the trial court excluded the prior adjudication under evidence code section 352. the court acknowledged that the adjudication was not remote in time but concluded that it was only marginally relevant for impeachment purposes because (1) different talso found that introducing the prior adjudication would be time -examination, defendant was allowed tired of it, so i had pulled her hair and she called the cops on me, 11 2. analysis exclude evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the probability that its admission will (a) necessitate undue consumption of time or (b) create substantial danger of undue prejudice, of confusing the issues, or of decision whether to admit a prior juvenile adjudication to conduct] reflects on the witne[the conduct] is for the same or similar conduct as the charged or any other conduct not amounting to a felonyis a less forceful indicator of immoral problems of proof, unfair surprise, and moral turpitude clark, supra, 52 cal.4th at p. 931, citing people v. beagle (1972) 6 cal.3d 441, 453, abrogated on other grounds in people v. diaz (2015) 60 cal.4th 1176, 1190; people v. wheeler (1992) 4 cal.4th 284, 296-297.)4 the trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding mother. juvenile adjudications are not prior convictions admissible under evidence code section 788 (people v. sanchez 4 clark, supra, 52 cal.4th at p. 931.) however, this factor is not relevant here where the witness is not the defendant. 12 (1985) 170 cal.app.3d 216, 218-219), but the conduct underlying those adjudications may be admissible to impeach if it involves moral turpitude (people v. rivera (2003) 107 cal.app.4th 1374, 1380-1382). contrary to what the trial court noted, the crime of misdemeanor simple battery at issue here is not a crime of moral turpitude. (people v. mansfield (1988) 200 cal.app.3d 82, 88; people v. chavez (2000) 84 cal.app.4th 25, 29-30.) the adjudication is also not relevant under the general rules of violence is admissible only when a defendant claims self-defense. (people v. wright (1985) 39 cal.3d 576, 587; evid. code,  1101, subd. (a), 1103, subd. (a).) at best, the adjudication is relevant as prior conduct inconsistent with her testimony that she acquiesced but its relevance for this purpose is almost negligible because with easy access to a gun. and even if it did, willingness to defendant him as a prostitute ( 236.1, subd. (c)). the trial court did not err in weighing the minimal probative value of this evidence against the time and problems of proof that would be involved in placing the exclusion of this evidence was also not prejudicial against her moth defendant raises two arguments in response. first, he argues that the trial court erred in balancing the probative value of the juvenile adjudication against the other 13 evidence code section 352 factors because (1) the trial court was adjudication into evidence would not take up undue time, as it first point lacks merit: the trial court was not saying that daisha would resist a strange man with access to a gun. defeitself irrelevant to impeachment (people v. medina (1995) 11 cal.4th 694, 769 [mere arrests are usually inadmissible, whether battery ipoint minimizes the confusion that can arise where a jury is confronted with what to do with evidence of a prostitution defendant is asking us to reweigh the various evidence code section 352 factors anew; this is not something we may do when reviewing a ruling for an abuse of discretion. code section 352 ruling violates due process and his sixth amendment right to confront witnesses. we reject this evidence, as is the case here, ordinarily does not violate a people v. boyette 14 (2002) 29 cal.4th 381, 427-limitation on cross-examination of a witness pertaining to that unless a reasonable jury might have received a significantly cross-people v. quartermain (1997) 16 cal.4th 600, 623-624; see ortiz v. yates (9th cir. 2012) 704 f.3d 1026, 1035-1036 [constitutional violation to preclude fear of loss of custody over her children].) the omission of adjudication has only marginal relevance in impeaching her testimony and because the conduct underlying that adjudication was before the jury. b. admission of cell phone video showing gun in 1. pertinent facts the people introduced secell phone. one video depicts defendant driving a car while loud defendant twice objected to playing this video because it showed him in possession of a gun. the trial court overruled both with a gun and (2) is relevant to -victims. defendant argued that the video was undated, but the prosecutor noted that the video was dated january 5, 2015 (which was around the same time as the other charged conduct). defendant also argued that 15 there was no proof the gun in the video was the same gun used to threaten rosemary or seen by daisha, but the court ruled that whether as part of his business, as part of the way in which he controls the prostitutes does he use a gun and if he has access to than probative under evidence code section 352 because the the jury viewed the video. the jury was also given a summary: loud music playing; [defendant] driving; male in passenger seat, woman in rear seat. camera pans down to gun in his lap, and 2. analysis as noted above, a trial court has discretion to exclude  352.) the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the video clip depicting defendant in a car that momentarily showed his access to a gun, which is relevant to corroborate the testimony of rosemary and daisha, who testified that defendant used or possessed a gun as a means of coercing them to work for him as scheme for forcing young women to become and then to remain from the video clip and from the summary is relatively minor 16 because the gun is simply lying in his lap (rather than being used) and because rosemary and daisha elsewhere testified to his access to guns. defendant proffers two reasons why the trial court abused its discretion in admitting this evidence. first, he argues that the trial court overvalued the probative value of the video and undervalued its prejudicial effect. defendant asserts that the video has less probative value because (1) the people never proved that it was the same gun defendant used to threaten rosemary and daisha or that it was an operative firearm at all, (2) the date of the video is unknown, any gun until she testified at trial. these assertions do not -like object to coerce the victims to act as his prostitutes; the gun in the video corroborates this use whether or not that gun is the same gun he used with the victims or an inoperable gun or gun-shaped object. the video clip has a january 2015 timestamp on provides some basis for dating it around the same time as the people v. smith (1999) 20 cal.4th 936, 973-974); to the contrary, it makes it more probative because the video corroborates their testimony, defendant also argues that the video is prejudicial because seeing a gun is worse than just hearing about it and because the 17 written summary submitted alongside the video eliminates the possibility that an inattentive juror might not see the gun in the video. neither argument is persuasive. the presence of the gun in the video was undoubtedly prejudicial to defendant, but people v. valdez (2012) 55 cal.4th 82, 145), and the video does not invoke that impermissible type of prejudice. and the possibility that a juror might not see the gun in the panning video is not pertinent when the underlying evidentiary question assumes the visibility of the gun in the video. second, defendant contends that the video constitutes impermissible character evidence of his trait for carrying a gun. (evid. code,  1101, subd. (a).) although evidence that a defendant possessed a weapon unrelated to the charged crime is impermissible character evidence to the extent that it is admitted rson who surrounds people v. archer (2000) 82 cal.app.4th 1380, 1392-1393), the evidence in this case was admitted for a different and wholly permissible purposenamely, to corroborate the testimony of two of his victims and to prove the common scheme or plan defendant used to lure and retain his prostitute-victims. c. admission of expert testimony on prostitution 1. pertinent facts the people called detective satwan johnson (detective johnson) as a witness. initially, he testified as an expert witness on the culture of prostitution based on his 10 years on a human trafficking task force, on speaking with more than 1,000 prostitute-victims, and 18 on his interviews with 80 to 100 pimps or human trafficking defendants. in this capacity, detective johnson testified to (1) the various ways in which minors become prostitutesnamely, tem or from juvenile court supervision who turn to pimps to provide food, lodging and protection, (b) are recruited from group foster homes, (c) are recruited through social media, or (d) are recruited by high school friends; (2) the reasons why these young women continue to work as prostitutesnamely, because they (a) have no one else to go, or (b) their pimp cares for them by providing who recruit women by violence or threats of violence, or hybrids the next day, and after two other witnesses testified in the interim, detective johnson was recalled as a witness to testify about what he observed when interviewing kianna prior to her preliminary hearing testimony. in this capacity, detective [defendant] was both a gorilla and a romeo pimp, and it really depends on his mood or 2. analysis a witness may testify as an expert, if he possesses the experience that the opinion of an expert would assist the trier of relied upon by an expert in forming an opinion upon the , subds. (a) & (b).) 19 testimony. (people v. leonard (2014) 228 cal.app.4th 465, 493 (leonard).) defendant nevertheless argues that detective young women who become prostitutes without being qualified to jury] he had formed the opinion that defendant was a hybrid romeo-gorilla pimp. a. impermissible psychological opinion women become, and then remain, prostitutes was based on his experience as a human trafficking investigator, including his interviews with over a thousand such women. because expertise people v. prince (2007) 40 cal.4th 1179, 1219-1220), and because experience may come from what one learns during interviews (people v. sengpadychith (2001) 26 cal.4th 316, 324), detective johnson was qualified to offer this testimony. contrary to what defendant johnson impermissibly suggest, as defendant asserts, that most troubled girls become prostitutes. he said no such thing. instead, he laid out the answers he had received from the thousand-plus young women he had interviewed as to why they became prostitutes. this was entirely permissible. b. ultimate opinion although an expert witness may generally opine on the ultimate issue in a case (evid. code,  805), that expert may not 20 because such an opinion does not assist the trier of fact. (people v. vang (2011) 52 cal.4th 1038, 1048.) this is why an expert witness may not offer his opinion on whether a person charged r a hybrid of the two. (leonard, supra, 228 cal.app.4th at p. 493.) detective johnson did not cross this line because he never offered his opinion on what type of pimp defendant was; all he did was explain those types. defendant concedes that detective johnson did not expressly offer an opinion on what type of pimp defendant was, testifying to what kianna during her interview. this impression was viable, defendant argues, because detective johnson testified about what kianna jury that he had completed the expert portion of his testi explanation of the types of pimps was separated from his recitation of what kianna said during the interview by two witnesses and one entire rotation of the earth. thus, defendant is wrong to state that the two topics followed one another detective johnson testified about his interview with kianna, he expressly stated tshe said that [defendant] was both a gorilla and a romeo pimp, and it really depends on his mood or his let the jury know he was recounting what kianna said, and not offering an opinion of his own. no further demarcation or 21 detective johnson was admitted solely to impeach her preliminary hearing testimony, and not as substantive evidence. iii. sentencing a. presentence conduct credit defendant argues that the trial court erred in denying him conduct credits for the days he spent in custody prior to sentencing. the trial court awarded defendant 796 days of actual conduct credit but declined to award him any good time/work was error. (people v. philpot (2004) 122 cal.app.4th 893, 907-908; people v. brewer (2011) 192 cal.app.4th 457, 464.) the parties agree that defendant should have been credited for 796 days of actual custody credit and an additional 796 days of conduct credit. because the failure to properly calculate custody and conduct credit is a jurisdictional error that can be corrected at any time (people v. chilelli (2014) 225 cal.app.4th 581, 591; people v. goldman (2014) 225 cal.app.4th 950, 961), we order the judgment modified and the abstract of judgment amended to award defendant 796 days of actual custody credit and 796 days of presentence conduct credit, for a total of 1,592 days. b. concurrent term for human trafficking count against emoni (count 6) our independent review of the record discloses a sentencing error not raised by the parties in their original briefsemoni (count 6), but the human trafficking statute ( 236.1, subwe sought supplemental briefing from the parties and now order the abstract of judgment corrected to reflect the imposition of an 22 eight-year concurrent term on count 6. (people v. delgado (2010) e may set aside an unauthorized sentence so a proper sentence may be imposed, even if the new sentence is harsher. disposition the judgment is modified: (1) to reflect 796 days of actual custody credit and 796 days of presentence conduct credit for a total of 1,592 days; (2) to reflect that the sentence on count 6 for human trafficking is eight years concurrent. the clerk of the superior court is directed to prepare an amended abstract of judgment and to forward a copy to the department of corrections and rehabilitation. in all other respects, the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. ______________________, j. hoffstadt we concur: _________________________, acting p. j. ashmann-gerst _________________________, j. chavez
