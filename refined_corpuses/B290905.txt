(senate bill 1393); and the imposition of fines and assessments, without a determination of his ability to pay, violated his due process resentencing in light of senate bill 1393. in all other respects, we affirm the judgment. factual and procedural background 1. facts a. (i) the threats against sanders kecia sanders worked as a uniformed, unarmed security guard at a los angeles mall in approximately november 2017, she and a colleague encountered pickens, asleep on the stairs at an entrance to the mall. the colleague told pickens he was trespassing and had to leave. pickens became sanders typically rode the metro train to work, and had seen pickens on the train five to 10 times. on one of those occasions, sanders observed pickens threatening a young woman, who appeared to be 16 or 17 years old, and who was wearing a uniform and a backpack. sanders explained, pickens with a young latin[a] 3 he ignored sanders and continued arguing with the girl. on january 27, 2018, at approximately 3:00 a.m., while patrolling the shopping center, sanders again saw pickens sleeping on a mall stairway. she asked him three times to get up and leave. the third time, he jumped up, cussed her out, and frightened, sanders backed up. pickens said, he pulled a black knife out of his pocket, briefly waved it in her face, and replaced it in his pocket. he ck off before i kill you, bitch. hoping to de-escalate the situation, sanders remained calm. she radioed for help and let she informed the operator that pickens had a knife. sanders did not run because she was afraid pickens would stab her if pickens walked alongside sanders, repeating his threats. sanders walked with pickens to the corner of 7th and hope streets to ensure he left the property. at the same time, d another security guard approached to assist her. shortly thereafter, pickens returned and screamed at sanders, voyt and the other guard. pickens angrily screamed at sanders, ,which she understood to be a threat. according to voyt, pickens threatened sanders at least a dozen times. officers arrived on the scene and, after sanders related what had happened, arrested pickens. sanders described the knife as a black knife with a long tip. officers found a knife 4 a video depicting portions of the incident, taken from the surveillance system, was played for the jury. the prosecutor also introduced into evidence portions of liminary hearing testimony regarding the incident. (ii) the july 2016 uncharged misconduct at approximately 9:30 a.m. on july 13, 2016, jose rodriguez was working as a technician for the metro transit authority at the 7th street station. a woman approached him and stated she was afraid to go to the subway platform because to me and he scares me rodriguez offered to walk her to the station platform. as rodriguez and the woman walked, pickens attempted to away from him. pickens responded that the woman was a racist. when rodriguez told pickens he should leave or he would call the pickens continued to curse at rodriguez. rodriguez radioed for assistance from the los angeles county pickens, who appeared agitated, moved close to rodriguez and opened his hand in an aggressive manner. afraid, rodriguez shoved pickens hard several times, while pickens cursed at and threaten pickens reached into his backpack and pulled out a knife-like weapon. rodriguez backed up and again radioed for help. pickens re afraid, motherfuckerside. rodriguez jumped back, held up his radio, and told pickens that if he came closer, rodriguez would break his head open. 5 back a he then walked across the street. officers arrived and detained pickens. he had a knife-like saw in his pocket. when cross-examined about the incident, pickens stated that he never approached rodriguez; however, rodriguez pushed him three times. he admitted pulling a saw out of his backpack, but denied approaching rodriguez with it, threatening to kill him, or trying to stab him with the saw. b. defense evidence pickens testified in his own defense. he was sleeping on the corner of 7th and flower streets, because medication he was taking [ed when sanders asked him to leave, he got up, put his backpack on, and walked down the sidewalk without saying anything. she followed and suggested that if he t street and sit at the metro station. he denied threatening sanders or pulling a knife. too much pain, due to a medical condition, to make such threats. sanders could not have seen him on the metro after her graveyard shift because on six days of each week, he spent all morning, between 5:00 and 9:00 a.m., at the slauson subway station, ensuring that no one bothered the female tamale vendors who worked there. then, he usually distributed food to four or five persons at 7th and san julian streets. after that, each day he returned to the slauson station to distribute hygiene items to homeless people. pickens insisted that he would never threaten or harm a 6 know this is not something to be proud of to be said, but i grew up in the streets . . . . and in the streets, contrary or negative to a woman. period. as discussed more fully where relevant post, the prosecutor cross-examined pickens about two incidents in which he behaved aggressively toward female strangers. pickens admitted suffering prior felony convictions for first degree burglary, vehicle theft, attempted extortion by threat or force, and making criminal threats. 2. procedure pickens represented himself at trial. a jury convicted him of making criminal threats against sanders (pen. code,  422),1 and also found true the allegation that he personally used a deadly and dangerous weapon, a knife, in commission of the offense ( 12022, subd. (b)(1)). the trial court motion for a new trial. prior to sentencing, persona status because of his disruptive behavior, and appointed standby counsel to represent him. in a bifurcated proceeding, the court found pickens convictions ( 667, subds. (a), (b)(i), 1170.12, subds. (a)(d)) and had served nine prior prison terms within the meaning of section 667.5, subdivision (b). it struck each of the section 667.5, subdivision (b) enhancements ( 1385), as well as one of the prior strike convictions (people v. superior court (romero) (1996) 13 cal.4th 497), and stayed sentence on the deadly weapon 1 all further undesignated statutory references are to the penal code. 7 enhancement. it sentenced pickens to 14 years in prison, comprised of the midterm of two years, doubled, plus two five-year serious felony enhancements. it imposed a $300 restitution fine, a suspended parole revocation restitution fine in the same amount, a $40 court operations assessment, and a $30 criminal conviction assessment. pickens timely appealed. discussion 1. admission of evidence of uncharged misconduct pickens contends the trial court erred by admitting evidence of the july 2016 incident and by allowing sanders to testify about his alleged behavior with the young woman on the train. he also argues that -examination of him regarding his aggressive behavior toward other women was improper. we discern no reversible error. a. applicable legal principles only relevant evidence is admissible. (evid. code,  350.) in reason to prove or disprove any disputed fact that is of conseqpeople v. bryant, smith and wheeler (2014) 60 cal.4th 335, 405 (bryant); evid. code,  210.) evidence a defendant committed misconduct other than that currently charged is inadmissible to prove his or her propensity to commit the charged crime. (evid. code,  1101, subd. (a); bryant, at pp. 405406; people v. rogers (2013) 57 cal.4th 296, 325.) however, such evidence is admissible if it is relevant to prove, among other things, intent. (evid. code,  1101, subd. (b); people v. molano (2019) 7 cal.5th 620, 664; people v. jones (2011) 51 cal.4th 346, 371.) issible, there must be some degree of similarity between the charged crime and the other crime, but the degree of similarity depends on the purpose for 8 jonesleast degree of similarity between the uncharged act and the charged offense is required to support a rational inference of intent; a greater degree of similarity is required for common design or (people v. gutierrez (2018) 20 cal.app.5th 847, 859; people v. jones (2013) 57 cal.4th 899, 930.) even if other crimes evidence is admissible under evidence code section 1101, subdivision (b), it should be excluded under evidence code section 352 if its probative value is substantially outweighed by undue prejudice. (bryant, supra, 60 cal.4th at pp. 406407; people v. thomas (2011) 52 cal.4th 336, 354.) because other crimes evidence may be highly inflammatory, it should be admitted only if it has substantial probative value. (people v. jones, supra, 57 cal.4th at p. 930; people v. ewoldt (1994) 7 cal.4th 380, 404.) relevance and the admission of evidence under evidence code sections 1101 and 352 for abuse of discretion. (people v. thompson (2016) 1 cal.5th 1043, 1114; people v. rogers, supra, 57 cal.4th at p. 326.) b. the july 2016 incident prior to trial, trial court ruled that evidence of the july 2016 incident was admissible to prove intent, pursuant to evidence code section 1101, subdivision (b). it concluded the prior incident was sufficiently similar to the charged offense, and the evidence was more probative than prejudicial. the court instructed the jury that evidence of the july 2016 incident was admissible only for 9 pickens argues the trial court erred because (1) the july 2016 incident was dissimilar to the charged conduct; (2) the evidence did not show his intent in the charged crime; (3) his intent was not at issue because, if he committed the alleged conduct, there could be no genuine dispute he possessed the requisite intent; and (4) even if relevant, the evidence was unduly prejudicial under evidence code section 352. the july 2016 incident was sufficiently similar to the charged offense. in both incidents, when an employee asked pickens to leave the premises, pickens reacted by getting angry, pulling a weapon, and threatening the employees. he told both victims he would harm them when he saw them on a subsequent occasion. and, both incidents occurred in a public place, in the same area of downtown los angeles. pickens points out that the two incidents occurred at different times of day; one involved a male victim, the other a female; the 2016 incident originated with offense he was woken up by the victim; and, in the july 2016 incident, but not the charged crime, the victim responded with physical force. but we do not view these differences as significant. the salient point was that in both instances, pickens reacted to a simple request to leave by pulling a weapon and threatening the victim. as noted, the least degree of similarity is required to prove intent or mental state; the offenses need only be sufficiently similar to support an inference that the defendant probably harbored the same intent in each. that standard was met here. (see people v. rogers, supra, 57 cal.4th at p. 326; people v. gutierrez, supra, 20 cal.app.5th at p. 859; people v. merchant (2019) 40 cal.app.5th 1179, 1193, fn. between the charged and prior crimes is not required]; people v. 10 jones, supra, 51 cal.4th at p. 371 [charged and prior robberies point of similaritythe intent to steal from victims whom .) pickens contends that in the july 2016 incident, victim rodriguez he did not take the threats seriously. therefore, pickens argues, the july 2016 incident did not show he knew or intended that his subsequent statements to sanders would be understood as threats. but rodriguez testified that he was afraid when pickens threatened him and pulled the knife from his backpack, and he called for help in response. moreover, neither the trial court nor the jury was required to accept cape. pickens further asserts that the evidence was irrelevant and lacked probative value because his intent was not at issue. he maintains that if he committed the conduct alleged, i.e., brandished a knife and threatened to kill sanders, his intent in doing so could not reasonably be questioned. in people v. ewoldt, supra, 7 cal.4th at p. 406, for example, our supreme court explained: molestation of his young stepdaughter], his intent in doing so effect of admitting evidence of similar uncharged acts . . . would outweigh the probative value of such evidence to prove intent in people v. lopez (2011) 198 cal.app.4th 698, the prove intent and knowledge in the charged burglary. (id. at p. 713.) the appellate court found this was error, reasoning: 11 someone entered the kitchen of the mendicino residence and took two purses. assuming appellant committed the alleged conduct, his intent in so doing could not reasonably be disputedthere could be no innocent explanation for that act. thus, the prejudicial effect of admitting evidence of [the prior theft-related crimes] outweighed the probative value of the evidence to prove intent as to the mendicino id. at p. 715.) that other evidence showed was beyond dispute; the prejudicial effect of the evidence of the uncharged acts outweighs its probative value to prove intent as it is cumulative regarding that issue. [citations.] (ibid.) similarly, in people v. willoughby (1985) 164 cal.app.3d 1054, the trial court admitted evidence that the defendant, charged with child molestation, had molested another child three years earlier. willoughby concluded this was reversible error, the problem with the intent theory is that appellant never placed his intent in issue; he categorically denied any sexual involvement with [the victim of the charged offense]. evidence of sex offenses with persons other than the victim of the intent is ambiguous, as when he admits the act and denies the id. at p. 1063.) intent was not in issuelimiting instruction, the evidence could have been considered by children. (id. at p. 1064; see also people v. von villas (1992) 10 12 the robbery and related charges, therefore the issue of his intent .) the people, on the other hand, point out that people v. booker (2011) 51 cal.4th 141, 171; people v. burney (2009) 47 cal.4th 203, 245; people v. lindberg (2008) 45 cal.4th 1, 23; people v. spector (2011) 194 cal.app.4th 1335, 1395.) to prove a violation of section 422, the prosecution had to establish that pickens had the specific intent that his statements be understood as threats. ( 422, subd. (a); people v. toledo (2001) 26 cal.4th 221, 227228; people v. orloff (2016) 2 cal.app.5th 947, 953; calcrim no. 1300.) generally, the people are entitled to prove their case element. (people v. steele (2002) 27 cal.4th 1230, 1243 tent to kill. even if this is so, the prosecution is still entitled to prove its case and especially to prove a fact so central to the basic question of guilt in people v. jones, supra, 51 cal.4th 346, for example, the prosecution show intent. (id. at p. 370.) our supreme court found no abuse defendant argues that only identity was actually disputed at trial, and he did not diresidence. even if this is so, it is not dispositive. [t]he burden to prove every element of the crime is not relieved tactical decision not to contest an essential element course, must prove each element of its case. assertion that his defense to the two charges was bound to focus 13 upon identity, and not intent, would not eliminate the to establish both intent and identity beyond id. at p. 372.) and, in people v. rogers, the defendant offered to stipulate that the charged murder , premeditation, and deliberation. (people v. rogers, supra, 57 cal.4th at p. 329.) rogers explained that a prosecutor cannot be compelled to accibid.) although the circumstantial evidence of premeditation and express malice present all available evidence to meet its burden of proving the requisite mens rea for first degree murder beyond a reasonable id. at p. 330.) we need not resolve the apparent tension between these principles because, even if evidence of the july 2016 incident was admitted in error, it is not reasonably probable that pickens would have obtained a more favorable result had it been excluded. (see people v. jones, supra, 51 cal.4th at p. 372; people v. carter (2005) 36 cal.4th 1114, 1152; people v. watson (1956) 46 cal.2d 818, 836; people v. gutierrez, supra, 20 cal.app.5th at p. 862.) the video evidence shows pickens interact with sanders in a hostile manner. after she approaches him, pickens almost immediately pulls his hand from his pocket, momentarily points his hand close to pocket. it is difficult to see whether pickens is holding a knife; one clip is filmed from a significant distance away, and in s hand. 14 nonetheless, sanders testified that this portion of the video showed pickens pulling the knife, and the film is not inconsistent with this testimony. moreover, sanders described the knife to officers. when they subsequently searched pickens, they found a black knife matching that description in his pocket. no reasonable jury would conclude that sanders lied abouse of the knife, but pickens coincidentally happened to have just such a weapon in his pocket. this evidence strongly supported a finding that pickens threatened sanders with a knife. pickens verbally threatened her. although there is no audio, it is readily apparent that pickens yells at or speaks aggressively to sanders, sometimes gesturing, moving close to her, or circling her, as they walk down the block. when sanders stops and radios for assistance, pickens walks on, but keeps looking back to where sanders is, apparently still yelling. when another security guard walks around the corner, pickens appears to yell at her. when voyt, sanders, and the third security guard walk to the corner to ensure pickens has left the premises, pickens approaches them, gesturing and apparently yelling, as all three of them back cautiously away. and, pickens repeatedly threatened to kill her was corroborated by voyt, who testified that pickens threatened to kill sanders [a]t the events shown on the video stand in sharp contrast to and preliminary hearing testimony that he did not get angry at sanders, and said nothing to her until she continued to follow him down the street. the video also underaccount to threaten her. to the contrary, the video shows him to be ambulatory and apparently 15 in no significant physical distress. in short, all the evidence moreover, several factors limited any potential for prejudice. july 2016 incident as significantly more inflammatory than the charged crime. (see people v. eubanks (2011) 53 cal.4th 110, 144 [potential for prejudice is decreased when uncharged acts are no more inflammatory than the charged offenses].) significantly, the court gave a limiting instruction advising that evidence of the prior incident could be considered only on the issue of intent, and for no other purpose. the instruction specifically required that t we presume the jury followed this instruction, which mitigated the potential for prejudice. (people v. rogers, supra, 57 cal.4th at p. 332; people v. homick (2012) 55 cal.4th 816, 866867; people v. jones, supra, 51 cal.4th at p. 371; people v. foster (2010) 50 cal.4th 1301, 1332.) cthe fact the jury knew pickens had been convicted in the prior incident further reduced any potential for prejudice, as jurors would not be tempted to convict to punish him for the prior offense. (people v. molano, supra, 7 cal.5th at p. 666; people v. jones, at pp. 371fact that defendant was convicted of the [prior] robbery reduced any prejudicial effect, as the jury would not be tempted to convict defendant of the charged offenses in order to punish him for the people v. steele, supra, 27 cal.4th at p. 1245.) in sum, even taking into account the principle that prior crimes evidence may be inflammatory, we are confident that 16 pickens would have achieved no better result had the july 2016 evidence been excluded. c. threats to the teenager on the metro pickens argues that the trial court also abused its discretion by allowing sanders to testify about her observations of his conduct with the teenage girl on the train. he contends evidence code section 352. the people are correct that pickens has forfeited this argument because he failed to object to the evidence at trial. evidence code section 353, subdivision (a) allows a judgment to be reversed because of erroneous admission of evidence only if an objection to the evidence or a motion to strike it was timely made and so stated as to make clear the specific ground of the objection.(people v. demetrulias (2006) 39 cal.4th 1, 2021; see people v. rivera (2019) 7 cal.5th 306, 341 [failure to object to evidence of uncharged misconduct forfeited contention on appeal]; people v. jones, supra, 57 cal.4th at p. 977; people v. hinton (2006) 37 cal.4th 839, 893, fn. 19 [failure to object to evidence under evidence code section 352 forfeits claim on appeal].) pickens asserts there was no forfeiture because he but in the cited portions of the record, pickens did not object to the evidence. he complained: lys try[ing] to paoverboard to tell me that i was cussing out some kid on the these statements did not amount to legal objections and 17 . evidence code section 353, subdivision (a) requires that an e . . . informed ruling on the . . . objection and to enable the party proffering the evidence to cure the defect in the people v. jones, supra, 57 cal.4th at p. 977.) to the extent pickens suggests his failure to object should be excused because he was representing himself, he is incorrect. (cf. people v. harrison (2013) 215 cal.app.4th 647, 656657 [defendant who exercises his right to self-representation cannot later complain about the quality of his defense]; people v. garcia (2000) 78 cal.app.4th 1422, 1430.) in any event, the claim fails on the merits. to prove a violation of section 422, the prosecution had to establish, inter alia, that the threat, on its face and under the circumstances made, was so unequivocal, unconditional, immediate, and specific as to convey to the victim a gravity of purpose and immediate prospect of execution; it actually caused the victim to be in sustained fear for her own safety, or for that of her immediate family; and the victims fear was reasonable under the circumstances. (in re george t. (2004) 33 cal.4th 620, 630.) the totality of the circumstances, including the partie prior contacts, are relevant to prove these elements. (people v. mosley (2007) 155 cal.app.4th 313, 324; in re ryan d. (2002) 100 cal.app.4th 854, 860; people v. butler (2000) 85 cal.app.4th 745, 753754.) here, s of pickens harassment of and threats to the teen on the train were relevant to prove these elements. on the train showed he was volatile 18 and prone to react with anger to innocuous circumstances. it also showed that he routinely made threats in an apparent effort to intimidate others. from this, reasonable jurors could conclude could also infer that pickens intended his statements to sanders be construed as threats. the evidence was therefore relevant and probative. d. cross-examination of pickens cross- examined him about two incidents in which he behaved aggressively toward additional women. the prosecutor asked about a january 10, 2016 incident in which he became angry at a female starbucks employee and pickens denied the conductwrote that report got mad because they was in a hurry. i was on my way. he pushed me and bumped my nose to the door, and i pull out my knife. the prosecutor also inquired about an april 27, 2013 incident in which pickens threatened and cussed at a female s deputy who was working undercover. the prosecutor asked pickens whether, when the deputy told pickens she did not need assistance purchasing a metro ticket, he became hostile, pickens testified that he had tried to assist the depand the deputy called him a racial epithet and told him to get out of the way. he said he did not make the alleged statements or threat.2 2 while the record is not entirely clear, it appears that the 2013 incident did not result in a conviction, and the 2016 incident 19 -examination was improper because, while the people may offer rebuttal character evidence through reputation or opinion testimony, evidence of specific instances of misconduct is prohibited by evidence code section 1102. this contention lacks merit. cross-examination because he failed to object to it. (people v. powell misconduct is forfeited when there was neither a timely and people v. rivera, supra, 7 cal.5th at p. 341 [failure to object to evidence of uncharged misconduct forfeits contention on appeal]; people v. doolin (2009) 45 cal.4th 390, 437 [evid. code,  1101 and 1102 challenge forfeited where no objection on these grounds was made at trial]; evid. code,  353, subd. (a).) assertion, there is no indication an objection would have been futile or ineffective. even if he had preserved his challenge it would lack merit. characterthat is, his propensity or disposition to engage in a certain type of conductis not admissible to prove his conduct on a specific occasion. (evid. code,  1101, subd. (a).) however, when a defendant offers his conduct in conformity with such character or trait of (evid. code,  1102, subd. (a); see idpeople v. hall (2018) 23 cal.app.5th 576, 591.) under evidence code section 1102, resulted in a misdemeanor conviction for conduct during the incident other than that described at trial. 20 opinion or reputation evidence only, not specific acts of misconduct such as prior convictions or the facts underlying people v. hall, at p. 592; people v. doolin, supra, 45 cal.4th at p. 437, fn. 31.) but here, the people did not question pickens about the two prior incidents to demonstrate his bad character or his propensity to violate section 422; they offered the evidence to directly impeach his credibility, i.e., his testimony that he always treated at them. when evidence is offered to impeach testimony, rather than as character evidence, different principles come into play. when determining the credibility of a witness, the jury may consider any matter that has a tendency in reason to prove or disprove the truthfulness of his testimony. (people v. harris (2005) 37 cal.4th 310, 337.) when offered for impeachment, subject to evidence code section 352, there is no prohibition on admission of the circumstances of a prior offense or misconduct. (see, e.g., people v. dalton (2019) 7 cal.5th 166, 214 [evidence of circumstances underlying a conviction is admissible to impeach credibility if the see generally people v. clark (2011) 52 cal.4th 856, 931; people v. wheeler (1992) 4 cal.4th 284, 297, fn. 7 [witness may be impeached with conduct involving moral turpitude even though the witness was not convicted, or even if the conduct did not constitute a criminal offense]; people v. chatman (2006) 38 cal.4th 344, 373; people v. lopez (2005) 129 cal.app.4th 1508, 1522; people v. hall, supra, 23 cal.app.5th at p. 589 [threatening to kill or seriously injure someone . . . is . . . conduct involving moral turpitude].) 21 for example, in people v. doolin, the defendant testified, inter alia, that he did not hate women or prostitutes, had not made derogatory comments about prostitutes, did not treat women differently when away from his family, did not call a woman a carry guns, did not drink excessively or use drugs, and was not (people v. doolin, supra, 45 cal.4th p. 435.) in rebuttal, the prosecution elicited the testimony of several witnesses who variously stated that they had observed him when he was intoxicated, had heard him describe his cocaine use and make derogatory comments about prostitutes, and had seen him carry guns; and a former girlfriend testified he ignored her protests that his actions caused her pain during intercourse. (id. at pp. 436437.) defendant argued on appeal that the rebuttal evidence was inadmissible under evidence code sections 1101 and 1102. (doolin, at p. 437.) our supreme court gave short shrift to these contentions, statingrebuttal witnesses was . . . properly admitted as direct the stand, defendant put his own credibility in issue and was subject to impeachment in the same manner as any other id. at p. 438.) the same is true here. pickens testified that he was always respectful and protective do and would not cuss at a womantestimony that directly contradicted the evidence that he threatened sanders. thus, evidence that he was lying and in fact repeatedly cussed at or threatened women directly impeached his credibility. the issue was not collateral or insignificant, but went to the 22 heart of the case. people v. beardslee (1991) 53 cal.3d 68, 95.) the questions comprised a relatively brief portion of the trial, and the prosecutor did not elicit unnecessarily inflammatory details about the incidents. its discretion under evidence code section 352. 2. cumulative error pickens next asserts that even if the purported errors were individually harmless, when viewed in combination they were prejudicial, requiring reversal of his conviction. as we have s claims of error or have found same conclusion with respect to the cumulative effect of any purported errors.

(people v. garcia (2018) 28 cal.app.5th 961, 971.) effective january 1, 2019, senate bill 1393 amended sections 667 and 1385 to allow a court to exercise its discretion to strike or dismiss prior serious felony convictions for sentencing purposes. (stats. 2018, people v. garcia, at p. 971.) senate bill 1393 applies retroactively to all cases that were not final when it took effect. (e.g., people v. garcia, at p. 973; people v. gonzalez (2019) 39 cal.app.5th 115, 123; people v. dearborne (2019) 34 23 cal.app.5th 250, 268.) pickens contends his sentence must be vacated and the matter remanded to allow the trial court to exercise its discretion to strike or dismiss the enhancements in light of the amended law. the people agree, and so do we. accordingly, we vacate sentence and remand for resentencing. we offer no opinion about discretion should be exercised. 4. imposition of fines and fees without objection from pickens, the trial court imposed a $300 restitution fine, a suspended parole revocation restitution fine in the same amount, a $40 court operations assessment, and a $30 criminal conviction assessment. relying on people v. dueas (2019) 30 cal.app.5th 1157 (dueas), pickens avers that he is indigent, and imposition of the fines and fees, without a determination of his ability to pay, violated his due process rights. pickens asserts that we should reverse the assessments and stay the restitution fine unless and until the people can show he has the ability to pay, or alternatively the matter should be remanded for an ability-to-pay hearing. we disagree. our colleagues in division two recently held that dueas was wrongly decided. (people v. hicks (2019) 40 cal.app.5th 320, 327329, rev. granted nov. 26, 2019, s258946; see also people v. aviles (2019) 39 cal.app.5th 1055, 1060, 10671069; cf. people v. caceres (2019) 39 cal.app.5th 917, 926927 [concluding that dueas does not justify extending its holdi we observe that the california supreme court is currently considering whether a court s ability to pay before imposing or executing fines, fees, and assessments. (people v. kopp (2019) 38 cal.app.5th 47, rev. granted nov. 13, 24 2019, s257844.) pending further guidance from our supreme court, however, we agree with hicks. moreover, unlike the defendant in dueas, pickens did not object below on the ground of his inability to pay. generally, where a defendant has failed to object to a restitution fine or court fees based on an inability to pay, the issue is forfeited on appeal. (people v. avila (2009) 46 cal.4th 680, 729; people v. aguilar (2015) 60 cal.4th 862, 864; people v. rodriguez (2019) 40 cal.app.5th 194, 206.) we agree with our colleagues in division eight that this general rule applies here to the restitution fine and the assessments imposed under the penal and government codes. (people v. bipialaka (2019) 34 cal.app.5th 455, 464; people v. frandsen (2019) 33 cal.app.5th 1126, 11531155; but see people v. castellano (2019) 33 cal.app.5th 485, 489.) finally, even if pickens had not forfeited his argument, dueas does not apply here. the situation in which pickens has put himself does not implicate the same due process concerns that were at issue in the factually unique dueas case. pickens, unlike dueas, does not face incarceration because of an inability to pay assessments and fines. pickens is in prison because he violated section 422, not because he was unable to pay the fine and assessments imposed. even if he does not pay them, there is no indication he will suffer the cascading and potentially devastating consequences dueas faced.
