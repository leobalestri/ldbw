(pen. code,  187, subd. (a), 664).2 as to the attempted murder of jashan, the jury found true gun allegations under section 12022.53, subdivisions (b), (c) and (d), but only under subdivisions (b) and (c) as to the attempted murder of keith, who was uninjured. the jury found love guilty of count 3, assault with a firearm, and of count 4, shooting at an occupied motor vehicle. as to count 4, the jury found true gun enhancement allegations ( 12022.53, subds. (b), (c) & (d)). the jury found true gang allegations as to all counts ( 186.22, subd. (b)(1)(c)). as to lockridge, the jury also found true personal gun use allegations under section 12022.53, subdivisions (b), (c) and (d), as to counts 1 and 4. love was sentenced on may 21, 2013 as follows: on count 1, life with a 15-year minimum term before parole eligibility, plus 25 years to life ( 12022.53, subd. (d)); on count 2, a concurrent life term plus 20 years to life ( 12022.53, subd. (c)); count 3, a concurrent three years plus four years ( 12022.5); and count 4, 15 years to life, plus 25 years to life ( 12022.53, subd. (d)), stayed under section 654. 1 lockridge was also charged, but he is not a party to this appeal. 2 all undesignated statutory references are to the penal code. 3 hat the attempted murders were premeditated, willful and deliberate. (people v. love (july 31, 2014, b249040) [nonpub. opn.].)3 we otherwise affirmed the judgment, but remanded for a retrial on the the people did not elect to retry the allegations, we directed the trial court to resentence love. on remand, love was resentenced, on count 1, to the low term of five years consecutive to 25 years to life under section 12022.53, subdivision (d). on count 2, the court sentenced love to five years plus 20 years to life under section 12022.53, subdivision (c), concurrent to count 1. as to counts 3 and 4, the court merely said the unt 4 as to discussion on count 4, the trial court resentenced love to the same sentence it had originally imposed, i.e., the base term of 15 years to life under section 186.22, subdivision (b)(4)(b), plus 25 years to life for the firearm enhancement under section 12022.53, subdivision (d) [personal and intentional discharge of a firearm causing great bodily injury], stayed under section 654. love contends that this sentence was unauthorized, because he did not personally discharge a firearm and therefore could not be sentenced on both enhancements. of a gang-related crime in the commission of which he did not personally discharge a the defendant may not be sentenced under both section 186.22, subdivision (b)(4)(b), and under section 12022.53. (people v. brookfield (2009) 47 cal.4th 583, 586, 590, 594;  12022.53, subd. (e)(2).) the defendant must be sentenced under the provision resulting in the greater sentence. (brookfield, at pp. 595-596.) 3 we take judicial notice of our prior decision. (evid. code,  451, subd. (a).) 4 , to a limited extent. the people agree love cannot be sentenced on both enhancements if he was merely the aider and abettor. the people also agree that the evidence and its theory of the case at trial was lockridge, not love, was the shooter. but the people disagree that its proper for us to strike one of the enhancements, because the jury found, albeit contrary to the evidence and the theory the people therefore conclude that because love never, in either this appeal or in the prior one, raised an insufficiency of the evidence claim as to the section 12022.53 findings, the appeal is a collateral attack on the judgment that might be better raised in a writ proceeding in the trial court. apart from whether love should have raised an insufficiency of the evidence argument as to the gun enhancement below or in the prior appeal, any failure to raise that argument would inevitably lead to an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. (see generally people v. scott (1997) 15 cal.4th 1188, 1211-1212 [an ineffective assistance of counsel claim requires a showing of error and prejudice, i.e., there is a reasonable prs failings, the result would have been more favorable to the defendant]; see also strickland v. washington (1984) 466 u.s. love personally and intentionally discharged a firearm was unsupported by the evidence. he was the aider and abettor, not the actual shooter. therefore merely vicarious, he could not be sentenced on both the gang and the gun enhancement. the 15-years-to-life sentence, being the lesser sentence enhancement of the two, must therefore be stricken. (see people v. scott (1994) 9 cal.4th 331, 354 [an unauthorized sentence may be corrected on appeal].) in addition to the unauthorized sentence on count 4, the trial court imposed, on count 3, a four-year firearm enhancement under section 12022.5. because the jury did 5 not find an allegation true under that section, the enhancement imposed on count 3 must also be stricken. disposition the judgment is modified and, as modified, affirmed. the 15-year enhancement under section 186.22, subdivision (b)(4), is stricken. the four-year sentence enhancement under section 12022.5 is stricken. the clerk of the superior court is directed to modify the abstract of judgment and to forward the modifed abstract to the department of corrections and rehabilitation. not to be published in the official reports aldrich, j. we concur: edmon, p. j. hogue, j. judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
