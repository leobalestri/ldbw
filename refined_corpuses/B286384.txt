[] no, he already left. [] . . . [] okay. [doe] [background noise] [sobbing]. [] . . . [] and you said this but does he live there or not? [] he lives here. [background noise.] [] and it was your brother in law who did it? [] yes. . . . [] okay. 5 up from school, the son told him defendant was a bad man who had grabbed doe by the neck and hair. at first, aguilar hesitated to cooperate with the prosecution. defendant had spoken with their brother lionel, who lived in mexico, and told lionel to threaten aguilar. lionel threatened to harm aguilaraguilar pursued charges against defendant. lionel told aguilar to drop the case or else [doe].4 aguilar received a second threatening telephone call from relatives in mexico. aguilar told the detective his call logs.5 on cross-examination, aguilar denied his relatives were simply urging him to tell the truth or to tell doe to tell the truth. doedoe called her and was crying. doe told the cousin defendant had just sexually abused her. the cousin told doe to tell aguilar. doe said she was afraid to tell aguilar because defendant had 4 aguilar happened to you outside the court that made you undecided about participating? [] . . . [] [a] because i received threats to not to continue forward with the case or otherwise my family would be harmed. [] . . . q who were you receiving threats from sir? [] . . . [] a israel would speak to my other brother in mexico, and he would tell me. [] . . . [] q and so what exactly was it that you felt or understood based on what your brother in mexico was telling you [defendant] was having him say to you[] . . . [] q that made you concerned? [] a because he said to leave the case or he was going to finish with [doe] 5 during deliberations, the jury requ] . . . 6 threatened to kill aguilar and their son and to continue abusing her. doe was also hesitant to call the police; she feared she would be deported. doe was examined at a hospital by a sexual assault response team nurse. doe complained of vaginal pain. the nurse took vaginal swabs. the nurse also took dna samples from defendant. subsequent testing showed defendant was the major contributor of the dna from the semen on the vaginal swabs. defendant testified in his own defense. he said he had been having an affair with doe since 2013 and all sexual contact was consensual. in 2016, doe became jealous that defendant was dating other women. on january 3, 2017, doe initiated the sexual contact. doe was consistent with what he january 4, 2017, the day after doe reported the rape. the jury heard p recorded interview with defendant. defendant said he had been in a consensual sexual relationship with doe for two years. doe denied having an affair with defendant. she denied that she had agreed to have sex with him on january 3, 2017. b. telephone calls from jail the jury heard recordings of three telephone conversations defendant had with his partner monica while he was in jail. in argument to the court, the prosecutor characterized the calls as evidence of consciousness of guilt in that defendant wanted monica to talk to his family members in mexico and ask them to 7 pressure doe and aguilar about the case. defense counsel asserted the conversations were irrelevant. the court concluded the jury should decide whether the conversations reflected consciousness of guilt. although the transcript identifies the woman with whom defendant spoke as liliana, defendant testified he was speaking with monica. during their first conversation, defendant told monica not to talk to doe or aguilar because a restraining order had been issued. defendant said he could not even send someone to talk to doe he described the restraining order as requiring in reference to doe, defendant said later. in their second conversation, defendant asked whether monica had called mexico. he told her, talk with him and he can do something defendant repeatedly prompted [t]monica told defendant she had talked to brother pablo, who lived in mexico; pahe talked with him, that [aguilar] in their third conversation, defendant discussed communications with pablo [] . . . [] to mexico too but to call pablo at night. [] [monica]: uh huh. [] [defendant]: and explain to him to see if he tells that guy because court, to pressure him. talk well with pablo. why [] [monica]: i have talked with them 8 and, uh, elisa told me that the [] [defendant]: tell him how things are. tell him everything that has been spent. tell him, talk with that guyher or him can do something. tell him, they can do something. [] [monica]: yeah. yeah, but that slut [] [defendant]: but [aguilar] does. he does. [] . . . [] [c]all pablo and explain it to him. tell him that i said. [] [monica]: yeah. no, i talked with, uh, licha and licha told me to calli mean, last week she called over there [unintelligible]d [] [defendant]: have pablo call and tell her. [] . . . [] have him tell her that she can do something. [] . . . [] because if not, after they tell her, she better accept the consequences. [] . . . [] please. call pablo[] . . . []and tell him. [] [monica]: yeah. yeah. [] [defendant]: agreed? [] [monica]: yeah. agreed. [] . . . [] [defendant]: tell him. all right then. [] . . . [] too. [] . . . [] complicate ourselves with jose. at trial, defendant told the jury that when he told monica that doe not done anything to doe and if she lied in court she would face consequences. defendant further explained that when he said aguilar got mad at him, it was because he had tried to tell aguilar doe.6 on cross- 6 this testimony appears to be a response to a misreading of he told me that the last time he talked with him, that [aguilar] ion 9 examination, defendant admitted he had asked monica to call his tell [aguilar] the truth of the relationship that defendant knew he could not communicate directly with doe, so he had to convey messages to doe or aguilar through others. defendant explained he wanted monica to tell pablo about doe. iii. discussion defendant argues the telephone conversations were inadmissible as irrelevant because: doe did not testify to any threats; the conversations were at best vague and equivocal as to any efforts to influence doe or aguilar; and the discussions did not corroborate aguilardefendant further asserts even if the telephone conversations were relevant, the trial court should have excluded them under evidence code section 352 as unduly prejudicial because they informed the jury defendant was in jail and undermined his credibility as to his innocence. reason to prove or disprove any disputed fact that is of  210; people v. clark (2011) 52 cal.4th 856, 922.) people v. harris (2005) you talked with him that [aguilar] ) 10 37 cal.4th 310, 337.) evidence a defendant has made a threat against a prosecution witness in an attempt to suppress evidence of guilt is admissible as indicating consciousness of guilt. (people v. vines (2011) 51 cal.4th 830, 867, overruled on other grounds by people v. hardy (2018) 5 cal.5th 56, 104.) whether evidence is relevant and admissible rests in the a trial court has discretionsimilarly, the court has broad discretion under evidence code section 352 to exclude even relevant evidence if it determines the probative value of the evidence is substantially outweighed by its possible prejudicial effects. [citation.] an appellate court reviews a courunder evidence code section 352 for abuse of discretion. arbitrary, capricious, or patently absurd manner that resulted in (people v. jones (2017) 3 cal.5th 583, 609.) the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining the telephone conversations between defendant and monica were relevant. in those conversations, defendant repeatedly asked monica to call relatives in mexico and implore them monica to talk to carlos and tell carlos he defendant wanted his brother pablo to tell doe she could do something and monica acknowledged she had spoken with several relativespablo, elisa, and licha. pablo had spoken with aguilar but aguilar got angry with him. aguilar testified he had twice 11 received threats from family in mexico, including his brother lionel. according to aguilar, defendant had spoken with lionel and told him to threaten aguilar. defendant had also, through lionel, threatened [doe]. considered in light of aguilar his relatives in mexico had threatened him, from the telephone conversations between defendant and monica. (evid. code,  350; people v. jones, supra, 3 cal.5th at pp. 609-610.)7 defendant characterizes the conversations as innocent, but that was for the jury to decide. 7 the trial court instructedefendant attempted to or did persuade a witness to testify falsely or attempted to or did fabricate evidence to be produced at trial, that conduct may be considered by you as a circumstance tending to show a consciousness of guilt. however, that conduct is not sufficient by itself to prove guilt and its weight and significance, if any, are for you to decide. was made by anotheconsciousness of guilt unless you also find that the defendant authorized that effort. if you find the defendant authorized that effort, that conduct is not sufficient by itself to prove [guilt], and its weight and significance, if any, are for you to decide. ress evidence against himself in any manner, including intimidation of a witness, by destroying evidence or concealing evidence, this attempt may be considered by you as a circumstance, tending to show a consciousness of guilt. however, this conduct is not sufficient by itself to prove guilt, and its weight and significance, if any, are for you t 12 the trial court also did not abuse its discretion in declining to exclude the evidence under evidence code section 352. but this is not the type of prejudice evidence code section 352 is intended to avoid. f the jury subscribed to the of evidence under evidence code section 352 is designed to avoid is not the prejudice or damage to a defense that naturally flows from relevant, highly probative evidence. [a]ll evidence which the to in evidence code section 352 applies to evidence which uniquely tends to evoke an emotional bias against the defendant as an individual and which has very little effect on people v. jones, supra, 3 cal.5th at p. 610.) here, as in jones, parties debated the meaning of the taped conversationwhich contained both statements that could be interpreted as inculpatory and statements that could be interpreted as exculpatorythe recording was neither misleading nor ibid.) it threaten aguilar and doe to drop the rape claim or to urge them to tell the truth about his consensual sexual relationship with doe. the jury was aware that, 13 at least for some period of time, defendant was in custody. the evidence was that defendant made three telephone calls from the county jail to monica. defendant argues revealing that he was in jail undermined the presumption of innocence. he analogizes the evidence of the calls to requiring a defendant to appear at trial in court may not require a defendant to attend trial wearing jail clothing, because such a requirement would impair the presumption that a defendant is innocent unless and until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt a constant reminder to the jury that the defendant is in custody, and tends to undercut the presumption of innocence by creating an unacceptable risk that the jury will impermissibly consider information, having the same tendency to remind the jury that a people v. bradford (1997) 15 cal.4th 1229, 1335-1336.) the custody information revealed to the jury in this case did not undercut the presumption of innocence. the fact defendant was in jail when he spoke with monica was not emphasized. there was no constancy as in the case of a defendant wearing jail clothing throughout trial. there was no conversations with monica. under these circumstances, we conclude dge that conversations with monica occurred while he was in jail did not have any significant potential to undermine the presumption of innocence.
