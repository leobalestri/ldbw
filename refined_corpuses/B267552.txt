(people v. rivera (2015) 233 cal.app.4th 1085, 10921093.) the california supreme court has granted review in the published decisions addressing (with conflicting results) whether a violation of section 484e, subdivision (d) may be classified as a misdemeanor under the provisions enacted by proposition 47. (see (people v. thompson (2015) 243 does not explain why the count 5 sentence, which originally was stayed, was not stayed on resentencing. on the record before us, we cannot say that the trial court committed error. 5 cal.app.4th 413, review granted mar. 9, 2016, s232212; people v. grayson (2015) 241 cal.app.4th 454, review granted jan. 20, 2016, s231757; people v. cuen (2015) 241 cal.app.4th 1227, review granted jan. 20, 2016; people v. romanowski (2015) 242 cal.app.4th 151, review granted jan. 20, 2016, s231405; people v. king (2015) 242 cal.app.4th 1312, review granted feb. 24, 2016, s231888; people v. thompson (2015) 243 cal.app.4th 413, review granted mar. 9, 2016, s232212.) jaime had the burden of proving to the trial court that she was eligible for resentencing. (people v. sherow (2015) 239 cal.app.4th 875, 879.) that includes the requirement that the value of the property not exceed $950. (people v. pak (2016) 3 cal.app.5th 1111, 11171118.) jamie has failed to show that the value of the property in issue did not exceed $950. her petition does not give any evidence of the value of the property. at the hearing, neither the trial court y in issue on count 5, although counsel stated, [o]ur position is that the [484e, subdivision (d)] is reducible since it is a grand theft crime and pursuant to . . . section [490.2], all grand stated above, the evidence at her trial was that jaime charged almost $10,994.25 to the discover card, and at her sentencing hearing an investigator testified that the transactions jaime made totaled that amount. jaime has not shown that the value of the property in issue on count 5 did not exceed $950, as required for eligibility for 6 resentencing under proposition 47. we therefore do not address whether violation of section 484e, subdivision (d) is reclassifiable as a misdemeanor under the provisions enacted by proposition 47. disposition the order is affirmed. not to be published. johnson, j. we concur: rothschild, p. j. chaney, j.
