(a); count 2) and kidnapping fernandez to commit robbery ( 209, subd. (b)(1); count 3). it was alleged that thomas had served three prior separate prison terms for felonies ( 667.5, subd. (b)). thomas pleaded not guilty and denied the prior prison term allegations. 2. the evidence at trial a. the pcase fernandez, mayra rodriguez, an employee of the storage facility at which thomas first met fernandez, and los angeles police officer jeffrey pelczar, who arrested thomas at the 1 statutory references are to this code unless otherwise stated. 3 storage facility the day after fernandez had been robbed, -in-chief. fernandez testified he met thomas in august 2014 at a storage facility at broadway and manchester avenue in south los angeles, where they both rented units. thomas told fernandez she was homeless and hungry; fernandez brought her food. fernandez and thomas remained in contact with each other thereafter. early in the afternoon of october 28, 2014 thomas called fernandez and asked him to meet her. they agreed to meet at 73rd street and broadway after thomas finished some business. thomas told fernandez to park on 73rd street because there was less of a police presence there. once fernandez had parked, thomas got into the passenger seat of his car. fernandez asked if thomas was hungry. less than a minute later a tall african-american man, later identified as george williams, came up demanded money. fernandez turned to thomas came here to feed you, and you do this t fernandez tried to give him the money from his wallet. williams took the wallet and . give me the fernandez replied he did not have any more money. williams then told thomas to pull the keys out of the ignition. as she did, fernandez tried to grab them from her; thomas responded by punching him in the mouth. williams told thomas to watch fernandez and said to williams walked around the car and got in the back passenger seat behind 4 thomas. he continued to demand more money and told thomas , which she did. williams directed thomas to search fernandez. fernandez initially tried to hide his second wallet, which contained $2,400, but he ultimately gave it to williams. as fernandez started to explain the second wallet, williams told him to shut up, struck fernandez on the head with his gun, causing him to start bleeding, and again warned him against doing anything wrong. at this point williams got out of the car, went to the took the car keys from thomas and said they were going to . williams asked for the address; fernandez responded with a false address. as williams began driving, fernandez unlocked the car door so he could jump out, but someone relocked it. thomas wafernandez again unlocked the car door, but williams was driving too fast for him to jump out. williams eventually stopped in a parking lot. fernandez quickly left the car, but thomas grabbed his collar and pulled him back in. fernandez managed to free himself and ran away. williams and thomas left the area in car. rodriguez testified she had seen thomas at the storage facility on a number of occasions with a tall african-american man with whom thomas appeared to have a relationship. a few days before the incident, rodriguez saw thomas holding a black gun. officer pelczar testified he went to the storage facility on the afternoon of october 29, 2014, where he arrested thomas. thomas had a black pellet gun and seven cell phones, including the two belonging to fernandez, in her purse. 5 b. the defense case thomas testified on her own behalf and confirmed that williams had robbed fernandez and stolen his car, but denied she had been a knowing participant in the crimes. thomas explained she had been dating williams for about six months at the time of the incident. he was physically abusive, but she stayed with him because she had no one else. according to thomas, after she met fernandez at the storage facility, he called her several times over the following weeks and paid her to perform oral sex. on october 28, 2014 thomas argued with williams while they were at a restaurant at broadway and florence avenue (one block north of 73rd street). she called fernandez and asked him to meet her and give her a ride to the storage facility. when fernandez called her to let her know he was at the meeting location, she walked there and got into his car. williams appeared suddenly ne. williams had a gun that thomas kept at her storage unit, which williams had taken without permission. thomas denied taking ; williams took those items. although the cell phones ended up in her purse, she intended to return them to fernandez. thomas also denied hitting fernandez or attempting to restrain him. she did warn him that williams was a very bad person. after williams stopped the car in a parking lot, fernandez leapt out and ran off. thomas jumped out right after fernandez, ran across the street and boarded a bus that was just leaving. thomas assumed williams had immediately abandoned the car because he got on the same bus. they rode the bus for 90 to 120 minutes, then both got off the bus in hollywood at santa 6 monica boulevard and vine street. they began arguing. thomas names, hit her and threatened her. thomas called the police.2 as she described to the dispatcher what williams was wearing, . . thomas picked it up and put it in her purse because it belonged to her. c. rebuttal los angeles police officer luis bonilla, officer pelczar and rodriguez testified in rebuttal. officer bonilla responded to s call to the police on october 28, 2014 after he had escaped from williams and thomas. he met fernandez at 70th street and western avenue about 2:10 p.m. fernandez reported that the incident occurred at 1:30 p.m. officer bonilla estimated the distance between the location where he met fernandez and the intersection of santa monica boulevard and vine street in hollywood was about 15 miles. it took about 30 minutes to drive from one location to the other. police was made about 8:00 p.m. officer pelczar testified thomas told him she had taken the bus to hollywood after the incident to visit a relative. pelczar observed a mark on thomas rodriguez testified thomas told her on october 29, 2014 that she and williams had taken williams dropped her off there and took all the money. rodriguez called the police. thomas asked rodriguez to tell them she was not there and let her escape. 2 a recording of the call was played for the jury. 7 3. the verdict and sentence the jury found thomas guilty of all three charged offenses. thomas waived her right to a court trial and admitted the three prior prison term allegations. the court sentenced her to an indeterminate term of life in prison for kidnapping to commit robbery, imposed the upper term of nine years for carjacking to run concurrently with the life term for aggravated kidnapping and imposed and stayed pursuant to section 654 the upper term of five years for robbery. the court also stayed the three one-year prior prison term enhancements.3 the court awarded thomas 437 days of presentence custody credit and imposed statutory fines, fees and assessment. 3 section 667.5 enhancements cannot be stayed; they must be imposed or stricken. (see people v. langston (2004) 33 cal.4th 1237, 1241 [[o]nce the prior prison term is found true within the meaning of section 667.5(b), the trial court may not stay the one-failure to impose or strike the section 667.5 enhancements constitutes an unauthorized sentence. (people v. vizcarra (2015) 236 cal.app.4th 422, 432.) because the impose the enhancements is clear from the record, we modify the judgment by striking the improperly stayed section 667.5, subdivision (b), enhancements. (see people v. bradley (1998) 64 enhancement is a legally unauthorized sentence subject to in addition, although the court ordered the prison term for carjacking to be served concurrently with the life term for aggravated kidnapping, the abstract of judgment fails to state whether the carjacking sentence is to run consecutively or concurrently. we order that correction as well. 8 discussion 1. misstatement of the evidence does not warrant reversal of t a. proceedings below during a break in thomasdirect testimony, the trial court asked the prosecutor if she intended to cross-examine thomas regarding any of her prior convictions. the prosecutor responded that thomas felony convictions for petty theft with a prior. in addition, the prosecutor stated, it when she was arrested on this case. her probationary status is se for weapons in a public place, as well as was set to expire . . defense counsel objected, arguing neither the pasadena case, which involved drugs, nor the weapons case involved moral turpitude. felony conviction, and she was on probation and had weapons further discussion the trial court ruled that the prosecutor could not ask thomas about the weapons or drug cases but could ask her about the theft cases. during cross-examination thomas admitted she had been convicted of a felony. she testified she was not sure if, as a result of her felony status, she was not allowed to own, use or possess any weapons. she later acknowledged s-ins with during her initial closing argument the prosecutor told the ms. thomasyou heard about her weapons conditions. she was on probation when this 9 happened, and she also has other theft cases. felon in the state of california. now, you get to hear that because you get to use that when you are judging her credibility. needless to say, her moral compass is a bit off, and it was certainly off on that day when she aided in a pretty scary later, when discussing thomasrespect to the call she made to the police, the prosecutor added that thomas justice system. nobody has more motivation to lie than a defendant any of these statements. in his argument defense counsel focused on fecredibility. he did not mention thomasnoting she had made some bad life and relationship choices and going to ask you to find ms. thomas not guilty beas the driven snow, guilty because mr. rather, he continued, he was asking the jury to find her not end from assaulting, robbing and stealing from mr. fernandez . . in her closing argument the prosecutor did not again discuss thomas b. prosecutorial misconduct i. governing law violates the fourteenth amendment to the federal constitution when it infects the trial with such unfairness as to make the conviction a denial of due process. conduct by a prosecutor that does not render a criminal 10 trial fundamentally unfair is prosecutorial misconduct under state law only if it involves the use of deceptive or reprehensible methods to attempt to persuade either the trial court or the people v. seumanu (2015) 61 cal.4th 1293, 1331-1332; accord, people v. cortez (2016) 63 cal.4th 101, 130.)

(people v. centeno, supra, 60 cal.4th at p. 674 plain on appeal of prosecutorial misconduct unless in a timely fashion, and on the same ground, the defendant objected to the action and also requested that the jury be admonished to disregard the perceived 12 ; accord, people v. charles (2015) 61 cal.4th 308, 327; people v. clark (2011) 52 cal.4th 856, 960.) c. ineffective assistance of counsel recognizing the likely forfeiture of her claim of misconduct, to the remarks challenged on appeal constituted ineffective assistance of counsel.

(see people v. vines, supra, 51 cal.4th at pp. 871-872; people v. ledesma, supra, 39 cal.4th at p. 746.)4 2. the trial court did not err in failing to instruct on simple kidnapping as a lesser included offense of kidnapping to commit robbery it is settled that in criminal cases, even in the absence of a request, the trial court must instruct on the general principles of law relevant to the issues raised by the evidence. the general principles of law governing the case are those principles closely 4 in people v. anzalone (2006) 141 cal.app.4th 380, on which thomas relies, the court held law during closing argument, which could have lessened proof, constituted ineffective assistance of counsel.

(people v. avila (2009) 46 cal.4th 680, 705; people v. cole (2004) 33 cal.4th 1158, 1206.) 16 thomas contends her conviction for kidnapping to commit robbery, which carries a mandatory life sentence ( 209, subd. (b)(1)), should be reversed because the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury with the lesser included offense of simple kidnapping under section 207, subdivision (a). simple kidnapping requires proof a person was unlawfully moved by for a substantial distance.

(see people v. carter (1993) 19 cal.app.4th 1236, 1251 [[i]n cases involving a kidnapping and robbery, courts have held almost without exception that the evidence supported the conclusion the robber had not reached a place of temporary safety ]; see also people v. cummins (2005) 127 cal.app.4th 667, 679.) based on this record, there was not substantial evidence to support an instruction on simple kidnapping as a lesser included 18 offense of the aggravated kidnapping charged. the trial court did not err in failing to instruct sua sponte on that offense.

(see people v. abilez, supra, 41 cal.4th at p. 522.) contention the flight instruction is impermissibly argumentative has been expressly rejected by the supreme court in people v. loker (2008) 44 cal.4th 691 in the context of caljic no. 2.52, the loker jury of inferences that c[an] rationally be drawn from the loker, at p. 706; accord, people v. johnson (2015) 61 argumentative, nor does it permit the jury to draw impermissible 20 people v. bacigalupo (1991) 1 cal.4th 103, 128.) 4. the court properly imposed concurrent sentences for kidnapping and carjacking although convicted of three felony offenseskidnapping to commit robbery, carjacking and robberythe trial court imposed sentence on thomas only for the aggravated kidnapping and carjacking; the sentence for robbery was stayed pursuant to section 654, which prohibits punishment for two offenses arising from the same act or from a series of acts constituting an indivisible course of conduct. (see people v. capistrano (2014) 59 cal.4th 830, 885-886; people v. latimer (1993) 5 cal.4th 1203, 1208.)5 thomas contends all three offenses were intertwined and under section 654 the court should have stayed the sentence for carjacking as well as for robbery. the question whether section 654 applies in a particular case is one of fact for the trial court, which is vested with broad latitude in making its determination. (people v. archer (2014) 230 cal.app.4th 693, 703; people v. ortiz (2012) 208 cal.app.4th express or implied finding that section 654 does not apply for substantial evidence (people v. brents (2012) 53 cal.4th 599, 618; people v. rodriguez (2015) 235 cal.app.4th 1000, 1005), viewing the evidence in the 5 section 654, subdivision (a), provides in part, an act or omission that is punishable in different ways by different provisions of law shall be punished under the provision that provides for the longest potential term of imprisonment, but in no case shall the act or omission be punished under more than one 21 light most favorable to that determination (ortiz, at p. 1378; people v. jones (2002) 103 cal.app.4th 1139, 1143). whether a course of criminal conduct is divisible and therefore gives rise to more than one act within the meaning of section 654 depends on the intent and objective of the actor. if all of the offenses were incident to one objective, the defendant may be punished for any people v. britt (2004) 32 cal.4th 944, 951-defendant of and not merely incidental to each other, [s]he may be punished for each statutory violation committed in pursuit of each people v. harrison (1989) 48 cal.3d 321, 335; accord, people v. pinon (2016) 6 cal.app.5th 956, 968; see people v. rodriguez, supra, 235 cal.app.4th at p. committing two or more crimes, for purposes of sect principal inquiry in each case is whether the defendantcriminal intent and objective were single or multipledefendantcircumstances . . . .people v. sok (2010) 181 cal.app.4th 88, 99; see britt, at p. 952.) implied finding that, even though the crimes were intertwined, thomas had separate objectives when she aided and abetted the 22 aggravated kidnapping of fernandez and the carjacking.6 after robbing fernandez of his money and phones while in the parked car, williams and thomas forced fernandez to ride with them in the car as a means to continue the robbery by driving to his house for more money and propertykidnapping to commit robbery. when fernandez escaped by jumping from the car, williams and fernandez stole the car in order to flee to a place of safetycarjacking. because there is substantial evidence car was not initially an object of the robbery, it was not error to punish thomas separately for the statutory violation committed in pursuit of each objective. (see people v. harrison, supra, 48 cal.3d at p. 335; cf. people v. mckinzie (2012) 54 cal.4th 1302, defendant could not be punished for both carjacking and kidnapping for robbery because the prosecutor argued to the jury that the victim] disapproved on another ground in people v. scott (2015) 61 cal.4th 363, 391, fn. 3 .) disposition the judgment is modified to strike the three prior prison term enhancements under section 667.5, subdivision (b). as modified, the judgment is affirmed. the superior court is directed to prepare a corrected abstract of judgment that also 6 the possession of another, from his or her person or immediate presence, or from the person or immediate presence of a passenger of the motor vehicle, against his or her will and with the intent to either permanently or temporarily deprive the person in possession of the motor vehicle of his or her possession, 215, subd.
