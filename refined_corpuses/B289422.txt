( 12022.53, subd. (h).) appellate courts have held that sen. bill 620 applies retroactively to cases not yet final as of january 1, 2018. (see, e.g., people v. watts (2018) 22 cal.app.5th 102, 119; people v. woods (2018) 19 6 circumstancesadvanced age, hearing and walking disabilities, and his attempts to reform himselfthe trial court denied the request. the trial commit armed residential robbery of particularly vulnerable victims. the trial court imposed 10 years in state prison for the firearm use enhancement. for the identity theft conviction in count 6, on its own motion, the trial court considered whether to redesignate the charge as a misdemeanor under proposition 47. relying on people v. liu (2018) 21 cal.app.5th 143, review granted june 13, 2018, s248130 (liu), the trial court found that identity theft is not subject to proposition 47 analysis or treatment. the trial -third the mid-term of two years) for the identity theft charge. the trial court reduced the charge in count 5, attempted theft ( 484e, subd.

(people v. jimenez (2018) 22 cal.app.5th 1282, 1289, review granted july 25, 2018, s249397 (jimenez), citing people v. gonzales (2017) 2 cal.5th 858, 876 (gonzales).)5 conversely, other decisions have held that applying purpose. that is, section 530.5 is not a theft offense, protects victims whose identity has been misused rather than the commercial establishment whose property may have been taken, 5 see also people v. brayton (2018) 25 cal.app.5th 734 (brayton); people v. garrett (2016) 248 cal.app.4th 82 (garrett). 8 and protects against harms broader than theft. (liu, supra, 21 cal.app.5th at pp.152153, rev.gr.) in considering the broader harms, those appellate courts conclude that proposition 47 did use of personal identifying information by redesignating the crime as a theft offense. (see liu, supra, 21 cal.app.5th 143, rev.gr.; people v. sanders (2018) 22 cal.app.5th 397, review granted july 25, 2018, s248775 (sanders); people v. weir (2019) 33 cal.app.5th 868, 873 (weir).) as we will describe, we find the latter analysis persuasive information falls outside the scope of proposition 47. a. sections 459.5 and 530.5 neighborhoods and schools act, reduced the punishment for certain theft-and drug-related offenses, making them punishable people v. page (2017) 3 defined as entering an open commercial establishment during regular business hours with the intent to commit a larceny of property worth $950 or less. (gonzales, supra, 2 cal.5th at p. establishment with intent to commit larceny is burglary. (id. at p. 863;  459.5, subd. (b).) age, courts have considered which crimespreviously designated as feloniesfall within this new crime of shoplifting and therefore qualify for resentencing as misdemeanors. one such felony is the unauthorized use of personal identifying information. ( 530referred to as identity theft, the plain language of the statute 9 weir, supra, 33 cal.app.5th, at pp. 873874.) furthermore, a violation of section 530.5, subdivision (a) is more accurately termed people v. truong (2017) 10 cal.app.5th 551, 561.) the elements of the crime are these: 1. the defendant willfully obtainersonal identifying information; [] 2. the defendant willfully used that information for an unlawful purpose; [] and [] 3. the defendant used the information without the consent of the person whose identifying information [he] was us2040, capitalization omitted.) in gonzales, supra, 2 cal.5th at page 862, filed march 23, bank to cash a stolen check for less than $950, traditionally regarded as a theft by false pretenses rather than larceny, now defendant gonzales then went, twice, into banks and cashed checks for $125, each made out to himself. the people charged him with second degree commercial burglary and forgery. gonzales pleaded to the burglary count, and the prosecution dismissed the forgery count. he later petitioned for resentencing under proposition 47. (gonzales, at p. 862.) the suprecontention that the electorate intended to limit the offense of shoplifting the common understanding . . . [of] taking gonzales, supra, 2 cal.5th at p. 869.) vides a specific definition of the term [b]y defining shoplifting as an entry into a 10 business with an intent to steal, rather than as the taking itself, section 459.5 already deviates from the colloquial understanding (gonzales, at p. 871.) the high court still not eligible for resentencing because he also entered the ion 530.5, subdivision (a). (gonzales, supra, 2 cal.5th at p. 876.) it found countera even if he 459.5, subdivision (b) would have precluded a felony burglary charge because his conduct also (gonzales, at p. 876.) gonzales ibid.) four days after issuing its decision in gonzales, our supreme court filed people v. romanowski (2017) 2 cal.5th 903, (romanowski). the high court held that theft of access card account information in violation of section 484e, subdivision (d)an offense that includes theft of credit and debit card informationunder proposition 47. (romanowski, at pp. 905906.) the romanowski court (romanowski, at p. some ways from other forms of theft, proposition 47 broadly (romanowski, at p. 906.) 11 b. the split of authority neither gonzales nor romanowski answered the question presented here: whether a violation of section 530.5, subdivision (a) categorically qualifies as shoplifting within the meaning of section 459.5. as noted, gonzales, supra, 2 cal.5th at page 876, both commercial burglary (entering a commercial establishment to commit a theft or any felony)6 and shoplifting (entering with intent to commit a theft),7 charged only with this would be true even if the requisite intent to commit a felony in the second element of burglary was premised upon something other than theft, such as felony identity theft. (gonzales, supra, 2 cal.5th at p. 876, [the bank with an intent to commit identity theft, section 459.5, subdivision (b) would have precluded a felony burglary charge ( 459) because his conduct [burglary] also constituted shoplifting ( italics omitted.) unlike gonzales, the prosecution here did not rely upon any theory of theft for the attempted property crime against the commercial establishment. the 6 the elements of second degree commercial burglary include: (1) the defendant entered a building; and (2) when he entered, he intended to commit theft or one or more felonies. (calcrim no. 1700.) 7 the elements of shoplifting include: (1) the defendant entered a commercial establishment; (2) when the defendant entered the commercial establishment, it was open during regular business hours; and (3) when he entered the commercial establishment, he intended to commit theft. (calcrim no. 1703.) 12 people only sought a remedy for the harm perpetrated against the owner of the personal identifying information. whether identity theft in violation of section 530.5 is itself eligible for resentencing under proposition 47 is currently before our supreme court. (see jimenez, supra, 22 cal.app.5th 1282, rev.gr.; sanders, supra, 22 cal.app.5th 397, rev.gr.) the court identified the issue presented as whether a felony conviction for the unauthorized use of personal identifying information of another section 530.5, subdivision (a) may be reclassified as a misdemeanor under proposition 47 on the ground that the offense amounted to shoplifting. appellate courts have reached different conclusions on the issue. in a decision filed april 17, 2018, sanders, supra, 22 cal.app.5th at page 400, review granted, the fourth district court of appeal hsanders, the defendant found cigarettes and a drink at a 7-eleven, and to get cash at a burger king. the total charges sanders made on the card were $174.61. (sanders, at p. 400.) sanders e are satisfied that section 530.5, subdivision (a) is not a theft based offense. theft is not an supports the applicat(sanders, supra, 22 cal.app.5th at p. 403, rev.gr.) sanders also identified the value id. at p. 405.) accordingly, sanders found romanowski to be distinguishable. (sanders, at pp. 480481.) 13 similarly, division eight of this court held that a defendant convicted of identity theft in violation of section 530.5 is not eligible for resentencing under proposition 47. (liu, supra, 21 cal.app.5th 143, rev.gr.) liu had been convicted of 22 theft-related counts arising from her scam of offering loan services to immigrants. (liu, at p. 146.) on the one count relevant to our inquiry, the jury had convicted liu of violating section 530.5, subdivision (c), the fraudulent acquisition and retention of the personal identifying information of 10 or more people. petition for resentencing was denied on that count. liu se(liu, supra, 21 cal.app.5th at p. 150, rev.gr.) liu distinguished romanowskiof access card information as grand theft (liu, at p.151.) liu grand theft, but descr . . . placed in sonation and which includes crimes such as marriage by false pretenses ( 528), and falsifying birth certifications and licenses ( 529a, 529.5).liu, at p. 151.) the court in liu observed that section 530.5 addresses harms other than theftgain, such as avoiding warrants, no fly lists, and protective orders. (liu, supra, 21 cal.app.5th at p. 151, rev.gr.) the court in liu 14 given the far-identifying iliu, at p. 153.) most recently, in weir, supra, 33 cal.app.5th at page 871, the fourth district court of appeal held that identity theft in violation of section 530.5 is not eligible for resentencing under proposition 47 because it is not a theft offense. weir had been convicted of four counts of obtaining personal identifying information, with intent to defraud after he was found in possession of the identifying information of four people. (weir, at p. 871.) the court in weir reasoned that the distinction between the crimes of having or using personal identifying information and the separate crime of stealing property under some other section 530.5(c) is punishable because of the particular nature and effect of the crimepotential harm that far exceeds the value of any property obtained by the subsequent misuse of the information, rather than the comparatively isolated consequences weir, at p. 876.) the weir court observed that the purpose of the identity (weir, supra, 33 cal.app.5th at pp. 874875.) it noted that isting law does not provide any remedy for the real victim: the id. at pp. 874875, fn. 6, citing sen. com. on public safety, analysis of assem. bill no. 156 (19971998 reg. sess.) as amended july 3, 1997weir, at pp. 876877.) by contrast, division six of this court affirmed a trial court r 15 identity theft to misdemeanors. in jimenez, supra, 22 cal.app.5th 1282, review granted, the defendant had cashed two apparently forged checks at a check-cashing business. the amounts of the checks were roughly $632 and $597. the appellate court noted duct [was] identical to [t]hey both entered a commercial establishment during business hours for the purpose of cashing (jimenez, at p. 1289.) citing gonzales, the jimenez constitutes shoplifting under [section 459.5, subdivision (a)]. (jimenez, at p. 1289.) jimenez found both sanders and liu guishable, but they also do not address gonzalesjimenez, at p. 1291.) furthermore, in brayton, supra, 25 cal.app.5th 734, a decision issued august 10, 2018, division six of this court reversed the denial of a request for resentencing on a felony identity theft conviction. there, the defendant brayton removed price tags from two items for sale in a department store, then returned identification. brayton ity theft crime are similar to gonzales, garrett and jimenez. to obtain a $107.07 store credit. she obtained the credit by the false representation that she was the person named in that d(brayton, at p. 739) the appellate court the amount of the loss. id. at pp. 739740.) 16 c. identifying information is not theft pending further guidance from our supreme court, we must decide whether s violation of section 530.5, subdivision (a) section 459.5, subdivision (a). section 530.5 was of identity fraud, who cannot protect themselves from fraudulent use of their identifying information once it is in the possession of another, because they cannot easily change their name, date of people v. valenzuela (2012) 205 cal.app.4th 800, 807.) the statute seeks to remedy harm inflicted upon the person whose identity was misused. (weir, supra, 33 cal.app.5th at p. 875.) it protects the person whose credit has been damaged or ruined rather than the commercial establishment from which property was taken. (id. at p. 876, fn. 6.) indeed, the drafters of proposition 47 and the voters who approved it were sufficiently concerned about identity theft in violation of section 530.5, subdivision (a) that the proposition contained an express provision that a person convicted of both forgery and identity theft would not be entitled to resentencing on the forgery count. (see gonzales, supra, 2 cal.5th at p. 870.)8 8 the elements of forgery pursuant to section 473, subdivision (b) include: (1) the defendant possessed or used a false or altered check, bill, note or other legal writing for the payment of money or property; (2) the defendant knew that the document was false or altered; and (3) when the defendant possessed, made, or passed the document, he intended to defraud. (calcrim no. 1935.) 17 it is noteworthy that neither forgery nor identity theft requires entry with an intent to commit a larceny or felony as is required of both burglary and shoplifting. nonviolent crimes like . . . people v. martinez (2018) 4 cal.5th 647, 656, citing voter information guide, gen. elec. (nov. 4, 2014) text of prop. 47,  3, p. 70.) at a time when personal identifying information is valuable and can be used for countless unlawful purposes, we are not persuaded that section 530.5, subdivision (a) is the shad in mind when they passed proposition 47. for entering a commercial establishment with an intent to misuse the state did not seek to protect target with those theories of theft. committed against hill, specifically, willfully obtaining and using her personal identifying information without her consent. this crime began when he obtained the information from her home. only his intent to use her information for an unlawful purpose. while this latter conduct may also have supported a charge for both burglary and shoplifting, we agree with the people that the court in gonzales did not expand the definition of shoplifting to include acts committed before or after entry. moreover, gonzales did not extend the act of shoplifting to reach additional nontheft crimes. proposition 47 would have permitted only the lesser charge of shoplifting as to two crimes18 burglary and shoplifting. (gonzales, supra, 2 cal.5th at p. 876.) this is true even if the second element of burglary contemplated identity theft as the felony the defendant intended to commit upon his entry. nothing in gonzales suggests that proposition 47 applies to separate nontheft crimes. we thus adopt the view of liu, sanders, and weir and conclude that section 530.5 is not a theft offense. furthermore, because the crime of identity theft is not proscribed by gonzales, it does not fall within the ambit of section 459.5. the trial court c 2. the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to strike the firearm use enhancement trial court abused its discretion in refusing to strike the firearm use enhancement by failing to consider his post-judgment behavior, and by misinterpreting the applicable legal standard. these contentions lack merit. section 12022.53, subdivision (h)may, in the interest of justice pursuant to section 1385 and at the time of sentencing, strike or dismiss any enhancement otherwise s discretionary decision to dismiss or to strike a sentencing allegation under section 1385 is reviewable for abuse of discretion. (people v. superior court (romero) (1996) 13 cal.4th 497, 531.) under . . may, either of his or her own motion or upon the application of the prosecuting attorney, and in furtherance of justice order an the trial court does not abuse its 19 discretion unless its decision is so irrational or arbitrary that no reasonable person could agree with it. (people v. carmony (2004) 33 cal.4th 367, 377.) furthermore, the burden is on the defendant to show that the sentencing decision was irrational or arbitrary. (people v. superior court (alvarez) (1997) 14 cal.4th 968, 977.) in resentencing a defendant, the trial court must consider his post-judgment behavior. (people v. warren (1986) 179 cal.app.3d 676, 687.) memorandum, a transcript of the preliminary hearing, a transcript of the original sentencing hearing, and the remittitur. the probation report from 2005 listed five aggravating and no mitigating factors: (1) the victims were particularly vulnerable; (2) the crime was premeditated in the current crime; (3) defendant took items of great monetary value; (4) defendant was armed; (5) the crimes involved great violence, bodily harm, or acts of cruelty, viciousness or callousness. lessons during his 13-year prison commitment and believed he had been adequately punished for his crimes. counsel urged the was 41 years old at the time of the crime, had no criminal history of -free while judgment, the trial court stbeen incarcerated. he appears to be a model prisoner. i also 20 recognize that he is more advanced in age; that he appears to have other disabilities, including his hearing disability. he now walks with a walker. i recognize that there [have] been attempts certainly entitled to the respect and any mitigating impact it has -judgment behavior as a mitigating the applicable legal standard by interest of justice. we do not agree. while the trial court observed that the legislative intent in enacting sen. bill 620 was ional tool where appropriate to avoid harsh sentences where, for instance, a firearm use enhancement may involve an unusual or significant mitigating mitigating circumstances of the crimes and conspost-judgment record. specifically, in addition to the mitigating circumstances identified, the trial court noted thatrust as a former united states postal service employee, used his former uniform to conceal his otherwise unauthorized presence in a retirement community, committed an armed residential robbery of vulnerable individuals, and when arrested, was found hiding and in possession of a firearm. the trial court declined to exercise its discretion in circumstances where it would not be justified. the trial court 21 enhancement. disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports murillo, j.* we concur: edmon, p. j. lavin, j. * judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
