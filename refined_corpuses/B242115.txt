(a)-(d), 667, subd. (b)) and for purposes of section 667, subdivision (a)(1), that in 2007 defendant had suffered a prior conviction of attempted robbery. a jury found defendant guilty of both counts as charged. when the prosecution did not proceed on the prior conviction allegation, it was dismissed by the trial court. on june 13, 2012, the trial court sentenced defendant to life in prison on count 1. the court imposed and stayed the middle term of five years as to count 2. the court also imposed mandatory fines and fees and ordered defendant to provide a dna sample and fingerprint impressions. defendant was given custody credit of 937 days, which was comprised of 815 actual days of custody and 122 days of conduct credit. defendant filed a timely notice of appeal from the judgment. prosecution evidence daisy c. (daisy) went out with friends during the evening and early morning hours of march 20, 2010. afterward, as she was walking alone towahouse, a white four-door car stopped near her and a man who was a stranger to her 1 all further statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise stated. 2 brown was tried separately and is not a party to this appeal. 3 emerged from the passenger side. at trial, daisy identified a photograph of brown as the passenger. when daisy saw brown coming toward her she turned and ran in the opposite direction. brown caught up to her and grabbed her by her coat. daisy wriggled out of the coat and continued running, but brown caught up again when she fell. he pinned her to the ground while she struggled and screamed. the white car then arrived at their location. daisy injured her wrist and suffered scrapes from her fall and the struggle on the sidewalk. daisy identified defendant as the driver of the white car. defendant took daisy by the shoulders while brown held her legs, and the two men forced her into the back seat of the car, causing more scratches on her shoulders. daisy fought and kicked at them and held her foot outside the car in an attempt to keep defendant from closing it, but he closed the door on her foot, injuring her ankle.3 once daisy was inside the car on her back, brown straddled her, exposed his penis and moved it toward her face. daisy turned her scrapes were bleeding and she was in severe pain. while still in the car, she asked to be released to seek medical attention. when defendant refused she asked for peroxide. defendant responded that he had some upstairs. daisy agreed to go on condition that defendant keep brown away from her. once upstairs, when no peroxide was found, daisy undertook a stalling strategy of complaining, whining, and crying. meanwhile, a neighbor called 911 and told the operator he or she had seen a man with a young woman who appeared to be abused and was begging and pleading. the neighbor gave the address, but refused to identify himself or herself. los angeles police 3 yolanda pinelo (pinelo), a resident of the neighborhood, testified she heard , looked out her window, and saw daisy resisting as the men were forcing her into the car. she did not call the police or summon help. 4 officers rosales and his partner silva were dispatched to the address and knocked on the apartment door. defendant answered, told them everything was fine and the only other bedroom floor crying. the officers then took defendant and brown into custody and secured daisy. the defense presented no testimony or other evidence at trial. discussion admission violated the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment to the united states constitution because the prosecution failed to either identify or produce the caller for cross-of a [declarant] who [does] not appear at trial unless he was unavailable to testify, and the defendant had had a prior opportunity for cross-examinatiocrawford v. washington (2004) 541 u.s. 36, 53-54, 68 (crawford).) respondent claims because defendant failed to raise a confrontation clause objection in the trial court, he has forfeited the issue on appeal. (see people v. redd (2010) 48 cal.4th 691, 730 (redd).) at trial, defendant objected to the 911 recording as irrelevant and lacking a proper foundation. a relevance objection does not preserve any constitutional claim (people v. raley (1992) 2 cal.4th 870, 892), although a defendant may argue on appeal that a consequence of the erroneous overruling of an evidentiary objection was a denial of due process. (people v. partida (2005) 37 cal.4th 428, 435-437.) in addition, a hearsay objection does not preserve a confrontation clause claim. (redd, supra, at pp. 730-731.)4 4 although defense counsel made no specific hearsay objection, he argued against exception to the hearsay rule. (see evid. code,  1240 [spontaneous statement].) defense counsel also objected to the admission of the recording under the mistaken belief that the 911 caller was known to the prosecution but had not been identified to the defense. 5 in reply to respondent, defendant cites authority for the proposition that when an objection is sufficient to alert the trial court to an issue it is not forfeited on appeal. (see people v. clark (1992) 3 cal.4th 41, 124.) defenthat . . . the new arguments do not invoke facts or legal standards different from those the omission, insofar as wrong for the reasons actually presented to that court, had the additional legal consequence people v. brady (2010) 50 cal.4th 547, 557, fn. 4.) although defendant cites these principles, he makes no effort to demonstrate how confrontation clause issue, or how overruling the objection had the additional consequence of violating the confrontation clause. finally, defendant makes no effort to refer to the factdo not invoke facts or legal standards different from those the trial court itself was asked ibid.) moreover, regardless of whether defendant preserved a crawford issue with a proper objection, his legal argument on appeal is wholly inadequate. the confrontation clause is not implicated by statements that are not testimonial. (crawford, supra, 541 u.s. at p. 59, fn. 9.) by citing the comment in crawford that the court would leave for a great deal of disagreement as to whether witness statements during 911 calls are -state cases and no case published after 2005. in fact, as respondent observes, the united states supreme court since crawford the context of statements made to police during ongoing emergencies. (see michigan v. bryant (2011) __ u.s. __ [131 s.ct. 1143] (bryant); davis v. washington (2006) 547 u.s. 813 (davis).) also, defendant fails to cite the several california authorities decided after davis which have found 911 calls to be nontestimonial without any discernible disagreement. (see, e.g., people v. gann 6 (2011) 193 cal.app.4th 994, 1008-1009; people v. nelson (2010) 190 cal.app.4th 1453, 1464; people v. johnson (2010) 189 cal.app.4th 1216, 1225-1226 (johnson); people v. banos (2009) 178 cal.app.4th 483, 492-493; people v. brenn (2007) 152 cal.app.4th 166, 175-176.) in crawford, the supreme court described the most obvious form of testimonial hearsay, including formal testimony and statements resembling testimony, such as responses to police interrogation undertaken to obtain evidence to be used at trial. (crawford, supra, 541 u.s. at pp. 51-precisely which police interrogations (davis, supra, 547 u.s. at p. 822.) the court held that when viewed objectively, if a reasonable listener would recognize that the caller was facing an ongoing emergency, not simply relating past events, and the statements elicited were necessary to enable the police to resolve that emergency, the statements are nontestimonial. (id. at pp. 822, 827-828; see people v. cage (2007) 40 cal.4th 965, 984.) determining whether an -bryant, supra, 131 s.ct. at p. 1158; see also people v. blacksher (2011) 52 cal.4th 769, 814 [live interview].) in his reply brief, defendant narrowly construes davis as generally excluding any statements regarding a past event in determining whether an emergency is ongoing. although the caller spoke of the events in the present tense, defendant contends that the following excerpts of the 911 call show only past events: y . . . but it sounds like a neighbor upstairs just got in with . . . somebody in a white cadillac . . . . abused and beat-up and she was begging and pleading. 7 with looks like? male or female? in bryant, the supreme court warned against employing an unduly narrow bryant, supra, 131 s.ct. at pp. 1156.) an emergency may be ongoing, for example, even if the police have secured the victim ibid.) thus, regardless of whether the caller is still perceiving the events, statemenprimary purpose is to deal with a contemporaneous emergency such as assessing the (johnson, supra, 189 cal.app.4th at pp. 1224-1225, quoting people v. romero (2008) 44 ordinarily made for the primary nontestimonial purpose of alerting the police about the situation and to provide ipeople v. gann, supra, only if the primary purpose of eliciting them was to produce evidence for possible use at a criminal trial. (johnson, supra, at p. 1225; see people v. blacksher, supra, 52 cal.4th at pp. 814-815.) in this case, the caller saw the victim, heard her screaming and begging before she went into the apartment. the caller was not sure a crime had been committed. at the time of the call the victim was not secure and the perpetrators had not been apprehended. given this factual context, even if we assume that the caller was describing events that were no longer within his or her vision, it is inescapable that any reasonable person listening to the call would conclude the statements elicited were not simply about past events, but necessary to enable the police to determine whether there was an ongoing 8 emergency, and then to resolve the problem. (see davis, supra, 547 u.s. at pp. 822, 827-828.) even if defendant had preserved the issue and the statements in the 911 call were testimonial, we would find the admission of the statements harmless error, beyond a reasonable doubt. defendant cites the following hearsay statemhouse, but outside it sounds like she was being abused and beat-up and she was begging during which she described being assaulted and abused, while attempting to escape. defendant complains that the statements in the 911 call were not harmless because screams and saw defendant and brown force daisy into the car. further, defendant displayed a consciousness of guilt when he lied to office rosales, claiming that the only would chapman v. california (1967) 386 u.s. 18, 24; see also delaware v. van arsdall (1986) 475 u.s. 673, 680 [confrontation error].) disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. ___________________________, j. chavez we concur: ___________________________, p. j. ___________________________, j. boren ashmann-gerst
