(pen. code,  211, 212.5, subd. (c).)1 the jury also found true a personal handgun use enhancement allegation. ( 12022.53, subd. (b).) the trial court found defendant had a prior strike conviction ( 667, subd. (b)-(i), 1170.12) and a prior serious felony conviction ( 667, subd. (a)(1)). the court imposed a 21-year state prison sentence. on appeal, defendant argues the evidence was insufficient ntification was unreliable. defendant also argues this case should be remanded so that the trial court may exercise its discretion to dismiss the firearm enhancement under subdivision (h) of section 12022.53 as amended by senate bill no. 620 effective january 1, 2018. we we further conclude no purpose would be served by a remand. accordingly, we affirm the judgment. ii. the evidence :00 a.m. on july 27, 2016, to obtain some items from his truck and move it from one side of the street to the other. he was sitting in the front passenger seat looking through documents in the glove compartment when a man he later identified as defendant 1 further statutory references are to the penal code. 3 approached. defendant opened the door, stuck a gun in dome [n], and neck. an unidentified accomplice, also armed with a gun, stood outside the truck. five days later, on august 1, 2016, bradfield met with detective michael lanza at the police station. detective lanza showed bradfield a photographic lineup of six men including defendant. without hesitation. he was 100 percent certain defendant was the robber. bradfield confirmed that identification at trial. he testified he was 100 percent certain defendant was the man who robbed him. bradfield also identified defendant in court as the robber. tierria mack testified as a defense witness. she stated that in july 2016, she and defendant resided she later testified that she did recall the evening of july 26, and defendant went to bed with her. according to mack, she told officer delores lett that defendant was with her that night. officer lett testified that on august 3, 2016, she telephoned mack and asked if she could confirm that defendant was at home at 3:00 a.m. on july 27. mack paused and then s detective lanza testified that he interviewed defendant some time after the robbery. defendant stated he stayed at both his mother night of the incident, he had stay4 close proximity to one another. officers searched both residences. they did not find any items connecting defendant to the crime. ii. discussion a. bradfie eyewitness identification of defendant defendant asserts insufficiency of the evidence in that the identification of him as the perpetrator. we conclude substantial evidence supporte the standard of review for sufficiency of the evidence is well-favorable to the judgment below to determine whether it discloses substantial evidencethat is, evidence which is reasonable, credible, and of solid valuesuch that a reasonable trier of fact [citation.] in determining whether a reasonable trier of fact could have found [the defendant] guilty beyond a reasonable people v. nelson (2016) 1 cal.5th 513, the jury, not the reviewing court, that must weigh the evidence, resolve conflicting inferences, and determine whether the prosecution established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. people v. hubbard (2016) 63 cal.4th 378, 392.) cally impossible or inherently improbable, the testimony of a single witness is sufficient to support a conviction. [citation.]people v. elliott (2012) 53 cal.4th 535, 585; see also evid. code,  411.) 5 -of-court identification is probative for that purpose and can, by itself, be sufficient confirm it in court. [citations-of-court identification generally has greater probative value than an in-court identification, even when the identifying witness does not confirm the out-of court identification-of-court] identification has greater probative value than an identification made in the courtroom after the suggestions of others and the circumstances of the trial may have intervened to create a people v. boyer (2006) 38 cal.4th 412, 480.) any doubts about the identification are for the trier of fact to resolve. (people v. elliott, supra, 53 cal.4th at p. 585; people v. rist (1976) 16 cal.3d 211, 216k of clarity and positiveness in weight, not the admissibility of the testimony. [citations.] and having been resolved on substantial evidence must be people v. rist, supra, 16 cal.3d at p. 216.) nding the identification and its weight are explored at length at trial, [and] where eyewitness identification is believed by the trier of fact, that determination is in re gustavo m. (1989) 214 cal.app.3d 1485, 1497.) under the authority cited above, -of-court identification of defendant alone was sufficient to support the verdict. moreover, bradfield confirmed that identification at trial. he was at all times 100 percent certain defendant was the perpetrator. 6 -of-court identification was inherently improbable because bradfield did not see a tattoo face or a missing front tooth.2 but bradfield testified hair was hanging down around his face during the robbery. bradfield further testified while outside the truck, before he could see said, need that out you, og; but once inside the vehicle, defendant never opened his mouth again. that bradfield did not see a tattorender his identification unreliable; these were issues for the trier of fact to weigh. (people v. williams (1973) 9 cal.3d 24, 37, disapproved on another point in people v. cromer (2001) 24 cal.4th 889, 901, fn. 3; people v. gonzales (1968) 68 cal.2d 467, 472.) the jury resolved against defendant the question of we do not second-guess that determination. defendant points to bradfi twice identified defendant in photographic lineups (rather than once) as undermining the reliability of the identification. bradfield viewed three photographic lineups, two on august 1 and a third on august 9. only the first lineup incphotograph. bradfield identified defendant as the robber. the second and third lineups contained photographs depicting men 2 mack testified that at the time of the robbery defendant had a tattoo on his cheek and was missing a front tooth. detective lanza testified that in august 2016, when he first contacted defendant, defendant had a tattoo on his face. the attorney general does not dispute that these traits existed at the time of the robbery. 7 accomplice. according to detective lanza, bradfield did not identify anyone in the second or third lineup. but bradfield testified he viewed a third lineup on august 9 and identified defendant -pack on august 9th, were you able to identify anyone?

[] on further examination, however came and showed me another six-pack of the defendant on there. . . . . i twice identified defendant, but he did not remember whether it was the same or a different photographic lineup. the jury could reasonably conclude either defendant was mistaken or, on august 9, detective lanza showed bradfield the first lineup, in which he identified defendant, as well as the third six-pack, which did not cont uncertainty did not detract t as the robber.3 3 the first photographic lineup bradfield viewed, the only was being displayed in the courtroom when bradfield testified as followsq. [by defense counsel]: and then you were shown three sets of photographs of six-packs like similar to the one that is in front of you on that screen, correct? [] a. yes, sir.

( 12022.53, subd. (b).) after defendant filed his notice of appeal, senate bill no. 620 took effect. (sen. bill no. 620 (2017-2018 reg. sess.) eff. jan. 1, [] a. yes.

(people v. billingsley (2018) 22 cal.app.5th 1076, 1080; people v. robbins (2018) 19 cal.app.5th 660, 679.) defendant argues we should remand this case to allow the trial court to exercise its discretion under section 12022.53, subdivision (h) as amended. we decline to do so. at sentencing, the trial court found multiple factors in aggravation and none in mitigation. moreover, in imposing the ten-year enhancement under section 12022.53, subdivision (b), and the five-year enhancement under section 667, subdivision (a)(1), the court clearly indicated it would not exercise discretion to strike those enhancements even if it had discretion to do so. the court years pursuant to the 12022.53(b) allegation.
