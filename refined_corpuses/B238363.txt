(people v. patten (may 2, 2011, b219908) [nonpub. opn.].) we remanded appellants case to the trial court with directions that the court give appellant a reasonable opportunity to present witnesses in his defense. upon remand, the trial court conducted a renewed probation violation hearing in december 2011. again, the court found appellant had violated his probation and ordered appellant to serve his sentence. the court awarded appellant 778 days of custody credits. appellant and the attorney general agree the court miscalculated appellants credits, and both ask that we remand this matter to the trial court for a correct calculation. for the benefit of the parties and trial court upon remand, we describe in the discussion section of this opinion the courts errors. 3 discussion 1. remand to recalculate custody credits at the conclusion of the december 2011 probation revocation hearing, the court told appellant, im going to give you every single day of credit that you are entitled to. both sides assert, and we agree, that the courts calculation of credits was flawed. when the court first placed appellant on probation in august 2005, it awarded appellant 266 days of presentence custody credit, consisting of 178 days actual custody and 88 days local conduct credit. in august 2009, when the court revoked appellants probation for the first time, it awarded appellant an additional 74 days of actual custody credits and 36 days of local conduct credits, raising appellants total custody credits to 376 days (178 actual + 88 local + 74 actual + 36 local). but the august 2009 abstract of judgment mischaracterized those 376 days. the abstract mistakenly allocated 340 days to actual custody and 36 days to local conduct. the correct allocation was 252 days actual custody (178 days from 2005 plus 74 days from 2009) and 124 days local conduct (88 days from 2005 plus 36 from 2009). we note the mischaracterization because the 340-day mistake figures in the courts december 2011 award of custody credits from which appellant appeals. during the december 2011 revocation hearing, the court began its calculation of appellants custody credits by noting that appellant received 266 days credit originally at time of sentencing in 2005. so far, so good. the court then incorrectly stated that appellants actual credits from the august 2009 hearing were 340 days; in fact, the correct amount was 252 actual custody days, consisting of 178 days actual custody in 2005 and 74 days actual custody in 2009. it appears likely that the court drew the 340-day figure from the erroneous august 2009 abstract of judgment. relying on the incorrect 340-day amount, the court stated, so im going to take that 340 and calculate the difference between that date and todays date [december 5, 2011]. and thats how we will calculate the actual time . . . . making that calculation, the court stated appellants actual time will be another 106 days. so itll be 340 plus 106. his new 4 actual is 446. here, the court made a new mistake. the number of days from the first revocation hearing on august 21, 2009, up to and including the december 5, 2011, revocation hearing at issue here is 837; it appears instead that the court misunderstood the august 21 hearing as taking place not in 2009, but in 2011 for which 106 days do run from august 21 to december 5. having miscalculated appellants credits for his periods in actual custody from 2005 to 2011, the court then awarded 15 percent local conduct credits, amounting to 66 additional days. approaching its final calculation, the court stated appellants total credits are 512 (446 actual + 66 local conduct). reaching its final calculation, the court stated, and then you add that [512 days] to the 266 he was given at the time of original sentencing [in 2005]. total credits are 778 . . . . and here again the court seems to have made a mistake because it appears that the 266 days drawn from the august 2005 hearing were included in the 376 days awarded at the august 2009 hearing, and were thus double-counted in the courts final calculation. as if the foregoing were not enough to illustrate the challenge of accurately calculating custody credits, the attorney generals brief raises for the first time on appeal changes between 2005 and 2011 in the law governing limits on presentence conduct credits for violent felonies. (see pen. code,  2933.1.) appellants underlying 2005 offense for assault with a deadly weapon was a violent felony because appellant inflicted great bodily injury on his victim. (pen. code,  12022.7, 667.5, subd. (c)(8).) the parties dispute the applicability of the 15 percent limitation. however, because limiting presentence custody credits involves determining facts such as, among other things, the length and place of appellants confinement, proper application of those limits rests, in the first instance, with the trial court. our foregoing exposition demonstrates an unclear record  a point on which both appellant and the attorney general agree. given the discrepancies in the record and the trial courts mistakes in calculating appellants custody credits, both appellant and the attorney general request that we remand the matter to the trial court for a correct calculation. their request is well-taken. 5 2. court security fee the parties agree that during appellants original sentencing in august 2005, penal code section 1465.8, subdivision (a)(1) mandated that the trial court impose a court security fee of $20. following the december 2011 hearing, the courts minute order imposed a $20 court security fee, but the abstract of judgment stated the amount was $30. appellant contends the amount should be $20 because that was the statutory amount at the time of appellants sentencing in 2005. the attorney general agrees. disposition the matter is remanded to the superior court with directions to recalculate appellants custody credits and to reduce the court security fee under penal code section 1465.8, subdivision (a)(1) to $20. rubin, acting p. j. we concur: flier, j. grimes, j.
