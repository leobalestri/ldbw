(evid. code,  1041; hobbs, supra, 7 cal.4th at p. 971.) defendant seeks to quash or traverse a warrant where a portion of the supporting affidavit has been sealed, the relevant materials are to be made available for in camera review by the (people v. galland (2008) 45 cal.4th 354, 364.) court should determine first whether there are sufficient grounds for maintaining the confidentiality of the s identity. if so, the court should then determine whether the sealing of the 4 [citation.] once the affidavit is found to have been properly sealed, the court should proceed to presented in the search warrant affidavit and the oral testimony, that contraband or evidence of a crime would be found in the moved to quash the wars general allegations of material misrepresentations or omissions are supported by the public and sealed portions of the search warrant affidavit, including any testimony offered at the in camera (ibid.; hobbs, at pp. 972-975.) oppose, we have reviewed the entire record, including the search warrant, the sealed and unsealed portions of the affidavit, and the transcript of the in-camera hearing conducted by the trial court. based on our independent review of those materials, we conclude it is not reasonably probable clark would have prevailed on any aspect of her motion to unseal, quash or traverse the warrant. the trial court acted well within its discretion in determining valid grounds existed for maintaining the s confidentiality, and sealing a portion of the affidavit was necessary ts identity. we have examined the entire affidavit for possible misleading statements or omissions and have found nothing that leads us to suspect any material misrepresentations or omissions were made. under the totality of the circumstances, there was a fair probability that execution of the warrant would lead to 5 contraband or evidence of a crime at the location to be searched. accordingly, the trial court properly denied motion to unseal, quash, and traverse the warrant. ii. section 11370.2 enhancements in supplemental briefing, clark contends, and the people agree, that the three three-year sentence enhancements imposed pursuant to section 11370.2 should be stricken because of a recent amendment to that statute. senate bill no. 180 (stats. 2017, ch. 677), which became effective on january 1, 2018, amended section 11370.2 to limit the scope of that enhancement to apply only to prior felony convictions for a violation of section 11380. as amended, the enhancement no longer applies to evidence to the contrary, it is presumed the legislature intended an amended statute reducing the punishment for a criminal offense to apply retroactively to defendants whose judgments are people v. brown (2012) 54 cal.4th 314, 323; in re estrada (1965) 63 cal.2d 740, 745.) because there is no indication that the legislature intended the recent amendments to section 11370.2 to operate be stricken. 6 disposition the judgment is modified to strike the three three-year enhancement terms imposed pursuant to health and safety code section 11370.2. the judgment is affirmed as modified. the superior court is ordered to prepare an amended abstract of judgment reflecting the modified judgment and to forward a copy to the department of corrections and rehabilitation. zelon, acting p. j. we concur: segal, j. feuer, j.* * judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
