(a)(1)).1 defendant admitted that he had suffered two prior convictions within the meaning of the three strikes law ( 667, subds. (b)-(i), 1170.12, subds. (a)-(d)) and was sentenced to 25 years to life. he subsequently petitioned for recall of sentence pursuant to section 1170.126. the trial court denied the petition on the ground that defendant commission of the offense and therefore ineligible for resentencing under section 1170.126. defendant appeals from the order denying his petition. we affirm the trial factual and procedural background2 defendant, a crips gang member, became involved in an altercation with a group of rival athens park blood gang members on december 25, 2007, when he arrived with the altercation became physical, and rival gang members began beating and kicking defendant. defendant staggered back to his nearby car where he began rummaging around. he came out with a gun and fired five or six shots at the group and then drove away. one man was killed. defendant was arrested a short time later following a traffic stop. the arresting officers recovered a gun determined that a bullet recovered at the scene of the shooting and a bullet in the vi 1 former section 12021, subdivision (a)(1) was repealed and renumbered without substantive change, effective january 1, 2012, as section 29800, subdivision (a)(1). (stats. 2010, ch. 711,  6.) all further statutory references are to the penal code. 2 much of the facts are set forth in our previous opinion affirming the denial of a prior motion by defendant, pursuant to people v. superior court (romero) (1996) 13 cal.4th 497, to vacate his prior strike convictions. (people v. mckneialy (feb. 4, 2010, b212141) [nonpub. opn.].) we restate the relevant facts as necessary. 3 defendant was charged with murder and with possession of firearm by a felon. he was acquitted of the murder charge, which was dismissed after the jury was unable to reach a verdict as to a lesser offense, but was convicted of the firearm charge. after admitting that he had suffered two prior convictions within the meaning of the three strikes law ( 667, subds. (b)-(i), 1170.12, subds. (a)-(d)), defendant was sentenced to 25 years to life. in march 2013, defendant filed a petition for recall of sentence pursuant to section 1170.126. following an august 27, 2015 hearing on the petition, the trial court found current offense and therefore statutorily ineligible for resentencing pursuant to section 1170.126. this appeal followed. discussion i. overview of section 1170.126 in november 2012, voters in california approved proposition 36, which enacted section 1170.126. that statute established a procedure under which a defendant serving an indeterminate life sentence as a third strike offender for a non-serious or non-violent felony that was a strike under the pre-proposition 36 version of the three strikes law could file a petition for recall of sentence and request resentencing as a second strike offender for that offense. (teal v. superior court (2014) 60 cal.4th 595, 596-597.) a petitioning inmate is eligible for resentencing if all three of the following criteria set forth in secserving an indeterminate life sentence for a crime that is not a serious or violent felony; (2) the life sentence was not imposed for any of the offenses appearing in sections 667[, subdivision (e)(2)(c) ] and 1170.12[, subdivision (c)(2)(c)]; and (3) the inmate has no prior convictions for any of the offenses appearing in clause (iv) of section 667[, subdivision (e)(2)(c)] or section clause (iv) of section 1170.12[, subdivision (c)(2)(c)] [citation.] (people v. white (2014) 223 cal.app.4th 512, 522, italics omitted;  1170.126, subd. (e).) sections 667, subdivision (e)(2)(c) and 1170.12, subdivision (c)(2)(c) impose sentence enhancements on offenders who have two or more 4 prior convictions for violent or serious felonies and whose current or prior offense falls within certain categories. among the commission of the current offense, the defendant used a firearm, was armed with a firearm or ( 667, subd. (e)(2)(c)(iii), 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(c)(iii).) at issue in this appeal is dfor resentencing under the second criterion set forth in section 1170.126, subdivision (e). the specific issue presented is whether defendant is ineligible for resentencing because uring the commission of the current offense, within the meaning of sections 667, subdivision (e)(2)(c)(iii) and 1170.12, subdivision (c)(2)(c)(iii). ii. standard of review and applicable legal principles defendant contends the trial court erred by construing sections 1170.126, subdivision (e)(2), 667, subdivision (e)(2)(c)(iii), and 1170.12, subdivision (c)(2)(c)(iii) to exclude him from eligibility for resentencing based solely on his access to the firearm that was in his possession. of law to which we apply the de novo standard of review. (people v. martinez (2014) 226 cal.app.4th 1169, 1181.) section 1170.126 was enacted by the electorate when it approved proposition 36. (teal, supra, 60 cal.4th at pp. 596-governed by the same rules that apply in construing a statute enacted by the legislature. [citations.] (people v. park (2013) 56 cal.4th 782, 796 (park).) when we interpret a e may adopt the construction that best effectuates the purpose of the law. (people v. albillar (2010) 51 cal.4th 47, 54-55.) because section 1170.126 was enacted by the electorate, it is the voters intent that controls. (see park, at p. 796.) viewing them in their statutory context, because the statutory language is usually the most [citation.] (albillar, at p. 55.) if the language of the statute is ambiguous, we examine other indicators of the voters intent, particularly 5 the analysis and arguments contained in the official ballot pamphlet. (people v. briceno (2004) 34 cal.4th 451, 459.) howevambiguous, the plain meaning controls and resort to extrinsic sources to determine the [electorate [citation.] (albillar, at p. 55.) electorates intent has been ascertained, the provisions must be construed to conform to that intent. [citation.] (park, at p. 796.) iii. whether d an inmate is ineligible for resentencing under section 1170.126 commission of the current offense, the defendant used a firearm, was armed with a within the meaning of sections 667, subdivision (e)(2)(c)(iii) and 1170.12, subdivision (c)(2)(c)(iii). ( 1170.126, subd. (e)(2); people v. osuna (2014) 225 cal.app.4th 1020, 1029 (osuna).) the phrase construed to mean having a firearm available for use, either offensively or defensively. (e.g.,  1203.06, subd. (b)(3); health & saf. code,  11370.1, subd. (a); people v. bland (1995) 10 cal.4th 991, 997 (bland) [construing  12022].) to be aware of existing laws and judicial constructions in effect at the time legislation is . [citation.] (osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1029.) e language of a statute uses terms that have been judicially construed, the presumption is almost irresistible that the terms have been used in the precise technical sense which had been placed upon them by the courts. [citations.] this principle [likewise] applies to legislation adopted through the initiative process. osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1029.) courts have phrase is used in sections 667, subdivision (e)(2)(c)(iii) and 1170.12, subdivision (c)(2)(c)(iii), and incorporated by reference in section 1170.126, subdivision 6 osuna, at p. 1029; people v. white, supra, 223 cal.app.4th at p. 524.) defendant acknowledges the applicability of the foregoing principles but argues that the terms as used in sections 667, subdivision (e)(2)(c)(iii) and 1170.12, subdivision (c)(2)(c)(iii) must be construed together to require that the arming be felony such that exists between the availability of the weapon and commission of the underlying felony. according to defendant, a must mean that the offender knowingly and intentionally had a weapon available for use offensively or defensively to aid the commission of the underlying felony. as support for this argument, defendant cites bland. bland concerned a sentence enhancement under section 12022 rm in the commission of a felony or bland concluded that for a defendant to be subject to additional punishment for boffense, section 12022 during the bland, supra, 10 cal.4th at p. 1002.) bland for sentencing enhancements under section 12022 does not apply, however, for resentencing under section 1170.126. numerous appellate courts have concluded that no facilitative nexus is required between an underlying conviction for firearm possession and a finding that the inmate was during commission of that offense when determining eligibility for resentencing under section 1170.126. (see, e.g., osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th 1020; people v. white, supra, 223 cal.app.4th 512; people v. blakely (2014) 225 cal.app.4th 1042; people v. brimmer (2014) 230 cal.app.4th 782; people v. hicks (2014) 231 cal.app.4th 275.) defendant concedes that the weight of authority is against him but argues that no court has offered a reasoned explanation for rejecting in this context. the 7 court in osuna presented a cogent analysis as to why that standard is inapplicable to resentencing determinations under section 1170.126, subdivision (e)(2). the court in osuna addressed the same issue as the one defendant raises here. like defendant, the inmate in osuna was sentenced to 25 years to life as a third strike offender following his conviction of being a felon in possession of a firearm. (osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1027.) he petitioned for recall of sentence pursuant to section 1170.126, and the trial court denied the petition after finding that he had been resentencing. (id. at p. 1028.) the appellate court affirmed the denial of the petition. in s that for disqualification from nder sections 1170.126, subdivision (e)(2), 667, subdivision (e)(2)(c)(iii), and 1170.12, subdivision (c)(2)(c)(iii), there must be an underlying felony to which the , and that one cannot be armed with a firearm during the commission of possession of the same firearm. (osuna, supra, at p. 1030.) the court in osuna distinguished between imposition of a sentence enhancement and disqualification for sentencing relief under section 1170.126 under section 12022, in order for a defendant to bland, supra, 10 cal.4th at p. 999.) the court in osuna ving a gun available does not further or aid in the commission of the crime of possession of a firearm by a felon. thus, a defendant convicted of violating section 12021 does not, regardless of the facts of the offense, risk imposition of additional punisin additional punishment to be imposed . . . [section 1170.126] disqualifies an inmate from 8 during the . . . . the continuaninternat. dict. (1986) p. 703.) in other words, it requires a temporal nexus between the arming and the underlying felony, not a facilitative one. the two are not the same. [citation.] (osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1032.) the court in osuna stated: snot the imposition of additional punishment but rather eligibility for reduced punishment, we conclude the literal language of the [statute] disqualifies an inmate from resentencing if he or she was armed with a firearm during the unlawful possession of tha(ibid.) the court in osuna found support for its interpretation of section 1170.126 in the the court noted that in enacting section 1170.126 as part of proposition owly drawn categories of third strike offenders who committed particular, specified offenses or types of offenses, but also broadly inclusive categories of offenders who, during commission of their crimes -- elements -- used a firearm, were armed with a firearm or deadly weapon, or intended to cause great bodily injury to another osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th reflected in the ballot materials related to proposition 36. these materials included strike conviction was for certain nonserious, non-violent sex or drug offenses or involved firearm possession.ibid.) how the initiative measure would shorten sentences for some third strikers, the legislative analyst explained there would be some exceptions to the shorter sentence: e requires that if the offender has committed certain new or prior offenses, including some drug-, sex-, and gun-related felonies, he or she would still be ibid.) the court in 9 osuna conducted an extensive review of ballot materials that distinguished between ho has been convicted of two or more serious and/or violent felonies in the past, and most id. ters court in osuna rejected the claim that conviction for possession of a firearm cannot under section 1170.126.
