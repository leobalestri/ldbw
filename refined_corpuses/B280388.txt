deputy mendez transferred the call to deputy jew; hinkston continued to use profanity and threatened to whoop a staff member. hinkston testified that he was unable to report for the july 6, 2016 appointment, because he had been shot in the back of his head and was hit with a 12-inch crowbar; he was laid up for seven or eight days. at some point after july 6, hinkston telephoned the probation office to make another appointment and to ask that the bench warrant be recalled, but the officer refused both requests. the officer told hinkston to bring his medical records with him to court. however, hinkston, who was in a wheelchair, did not submit any hospitalization or medical records at the hearing. hinkstons record confirmed his testimony that he registered as a narcotics offender. deputy jew was recalled as a witness; he testified that, prior to july 2016, hinkston last reported on november 3, 2015, and was arrested on april 15, 2016. hinkston was released on june 21, 2016, at which time probation officers transported him to the office. he was scheduled to report on july 6, 2016, but did not do so; however, he did call in on july 13, 2016. 5 the court found that hinkston was not credible and pointed out that when the deputy asked hinkston for his hospital records, hinkston became verbally abusive. the court recounted hinkstons previous failures at probation, as well as his verbal abuse of probation staff. the court imposed the remainder of his five-year sentence, with a credit of 1,151 actual and good time/work time days. the court imposed a $280 probation revocation fine (pen. code,  1202.44); a $280 restitution fine (pen. code,  1202.4, subd. (b)); a $30 criminal conviction fine/facilities assessment (gov. code,  70373, subd. (a)); a $40 court security fee (pen. code,  1465.8, subd. (a)(1)); and a $50 crime lab fee plus penalty assessment (health & saf. code,  11372.5). hinkston timely appealed. discussion after review of the record, hinkstons court-appointed appellate counsel filed an opening brief, asking this court to review the record independently pursuant to wende, supra, 25 cal.3d 436. we advised hinkston that he had 30 days within which to submit any contentions or issues that he wished us to consider. hinkston has not filed a supplemental brief. a court may revoke probation when one or more condition is violated. (pen. code,  1203.2, subd. (a).) a probation violation must be willful to justify revocation of probation. (people v. rodriguez (2013) 222 cal.app.4th 578, 594; people v. galvan (2007) 155 cal.app.4th 978, 982.) we give great deference to the trial court and resolve all inferences and intendments in favor of the judgment. similarly, all conflicting evidence will be resolved in favor of the decision. (people v. kurey (2001) 88 cal.app.4th 840, 848849.) moreover, we review the trial courts finding that 6 hinkston violated probation, and the courts decision to revoke probation, for abuse of discretion. (people v. rodriguez (1990) 51 cal.3d 437, 443.) it is hinkstons burden to establish that the court abused its discretion in revoking probation. (id. at p. 442.) hinkston testified that a probation officer instructed him to bring his hospital or other medical records to the july 6, 2017 probation violation hearing. he did not do so and, thus, failed to support his claim that physical injuries prevented him from reporting. given that hinkston has an undisputed history of failing to report and the court found that he was not credible, substantial evidence exists from which the trial court could have found by a preponderance of the evidence that hinkstons failure to report was willful. we have examined the entire record and are satisfied that no arguable issues exist, and that hinkston has, by virtue of counsels compliance with the wende procedure and our review of the record, received adequate and effective appellate review of the judgment entered against him in this case. (smith v. robbins (2000) 528 u.s. 259, 278; people v. kelly (2006) 40 cal.4th 106, 112-113.) 7 disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports dhanidina, j. we concur: edmon, p. j. lavin, j. judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
