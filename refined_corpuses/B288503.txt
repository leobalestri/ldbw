(a)) and arson of an inhabited structure ( 451, subd. (b)). the information specially alleged settle had suffered two prior convictions for serious or violent felonies within the meaning of the three strikes law ( 667, subds. (b)-(h); 1170.12), two prior convictions for serious felonies within the meaning of section 667, subdivision (a), and had served a prior separate prison term for a felony within the meaning of section 667.5, subdivision (b). settle pleaded not guilty and denied the special allegations. 2. the evidence at trial a. sometime in july or august of 2015 settle moved into his palmdale. in october 2015 settle and blackburn had an argument, and settle left her home and moved in with his girlfriend, christina whitaker. on october 29, 2015 at or near 1:00 a.m., whitaker settle could collect some of his belongings. settle later drove . during that same morningyoung, called blackburn to speak with her before going to her home to take her to an appointment. settle answered the phone and told young not to come over because blackburn had cancelled found the front door locked and the shades lowered; no one was 4 home. young became concerned because blackburn rarely left her home and had not told young she was going out of town. on october 30, 2015 at 7:30 a.m., one of neighbors looked out her kitchen window and saw settle walking truck. two minutes later, the neighbor noticed smoke coming the 911 emergency number. bound to a chair in the living room. an electrical cord had been tied tightly around a propane torch was found on the floor by her feet. b. forensic evidence a specialist in arson investigation determined the fire had been started by someone using a blue propane torch to ignite a all of the had been turned to the investigator the the coroner opined blackburn died before the fire started because no soot was found in her lungs, indicating she had not been breathing at the time of the fire. he concluded blackburn died from ligature strangulation,2 which could have occurred days before the fire. no sufficient dna sample was collected from the electrical cord and no dna profile could be made using dna samples from the stovetop burner knobs. cell 2 the coroner explained igature refers to anything that can here, the electrical cord was used as a ligature. 5 phone tower records placed settle in palmdale during the early morning hours of october 29, a few hours before the fire at young testified she had seen a blue propane torch in when she cleaned his room after he had moved out. c. on october 31, 2015 settle was arrested and placed in custody at twin towers correctional facility in los angeles. on november 1, sergeant robert gray and detective kevin acebedo interviewed settle in jail. before advising settle of his rights under miranda, the following discussion took place: hey, richard. richard. how are you? hey, man. tried to kill my grandmother, man. fuck this shit, man. ask me to come in, man. ame in? all you had to do was ask me. alright, relax 6 okay. called my n you here. who, who said that? no, no, no, no, no. my neighbor said that you said you called my t answer. she also said that you went through her phone, well, how would you went through her phone? no. what neighbor is this? the littlethat girlthe fucking alright, well obviously we got off on the wrong foot here. charged now, so i have nothing to say to you. the detectives then partially advised settle of his rights under miranda, and the interview continued. d. statements before trial defense counsel statements made during the custodial interview, arguing the 7 statements had been obtained in violation of miranda. detective acebedo testified he gave settle a miranda advisement following the court granted the defense motion to exclude all statements made after the incomplete miranda advisement. defense counsel argued the entire interview should be excluded, insisting the pre-miranda statements were also inadmissible as the product of an improper custodial interrogation. the court declined to exclude the pre-miranda portion of the interview, concluding statements were not the product of interrogation and thus did not violate miranda. the people played the audio tape of the pre-miranda portion of e. pretrial request to bifurcate trial of his prior convictions and to admonish the witnesses not to mention his criminal history. trial. the court denied motions for mistrial, ruling the statements were not prejudicial because they were brief, general and vague and did not refer to a specific prior conviction. 3. settle did not testify or present any evidence at trial. his counsel argued that, because settle was the only suspect detectives had considered in the case, they had tailored the evidence to frame him as the murderer and arsonist. 8 4. jury instructions, verdict and sentencing the court instructed the jury on, among other things, second degree murder (calcrim nos. 500, 520), arson of an inhabited structure (calcrim no. 1502) and the lesser included offense of simple arson (calcrim no. 1515). the jury found settle guilty of second degree murder and simple arson. in a bifurcated proceeding the jury found settle had suffered one prior serious or violent felony conviction within the meaning of the three strikes law and one serious felony within the meaning of section 667, subdivision (a), and had served a prior separate prison term for a felony within the meaning of section 667.5, subdivision (b). dismiss his prior serious felony conviction under section 1385 and people v. superior court (romero) (1996) 13 cal.4th 497, 508 and sentenced him an aggregate state prison term of 48 years to life: an indeterminate term of 30 years to life for second degree murder (count one) (15 years to life, doubled under the three strikes law), plus five years for the prior serious felony conviction, plus one year for the prior prison term, and a consecutive 12-year determinate term for arson of a structure (count two) (the upper term of six years doubled). in addition, the court ordered settle to pay a $10,000 restitution fine pursuant to section 1202.4, a court facilities assessment of $30 (gov. code  70373, subd. (a)) and a court operations assessment of $40 ( 1465.8). the court imposed and stayed a $10,000 parole revocation restitution fine ( 1202.45). 9 discussion 1. -miranda statements, even if error, was harmless a. governing law and standard of review miranda admonitions (advising a defendant of his or her right to remain silent, to the presence of an attorney and, if indigent, to appointed counsel) must be given, and a suspect in custody must knowingly and intelligently waive those rights before being subjected to either express questioning or its (rhode island v. innis (1980) 446 u.s. 291, 300-301 [100 s.ct. 1682, 64 l.ed.2d 297]; people v. ray (1996) 13 cal.4th 313, 336.) custodial interrogation, we mean questioning initiated by law enforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his (miranda, supra, 384 u.s. at p. 444.) stody but not interrogation miranda does (people v. harmon (1992) 7 cal.app.4th 845, 853.) actions . . . the police should know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating re(people v. enraca (2012) 53 cal.4th 735, 752; accord, people v. elizalde (2015) 61 cal.4th 523, 531; see davis v. united states (1994) 512 u.s. 452, 458 [114 s.ct. 2350, 129 l.ed.2d 362]; rhoda island v. innis, supra, 446 u.s. at p. 301.) determining whether the words or actions of the police were likely to lead to an incriminating response focuses on the perception of the suspect, rather than the intent of the officers involved.

(see people v. andreasen, supra, 214 cal.app.4th at p. 89.) sergeant ure out what happened, presents a much closer question. despite being framed as a declarative statement, sergeant comment signaled his desire to learn about the circumstances of thus reasonably could have been interpreted by settle as an attempt to elicit an incriminating response. (people v. davis declarative statement to suspect that indirectly accused the suspect of committing the alleged shooting constituted interrogation]; people v. sims (1993) 5 cal.4th 405, 443-444 12 [confronting suspect with evidence linking him to crimes is a technique of persuasionincriminate himself, even if the officer did not ask the suspect questions]; in re albert r. (1980) 112 cal.app.3d 783, 790 [officer statements may amount to custodial interrogation without being phrased in questioning form].) nonetheless, we need not decide whether sergeant statements crossed the line between small talk and interrogation. esergeant gray was the product of custodial interrogation in violation of miranda, any error in admitting the statements was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.

(2) federal constitutional error is properly 13 settle in the murder of blackburn or the arson of her mobile home. at most, they revealed his anger at being arrested rather than being asked to give a voluntary statement. therefore, the statements cannot be considered incriminating. settle disputes this conclusion by emphasizing that the prosecutor referred to the statements in closing argument to demonstrate his guilt. in particular, in response to defense had considered in the case, the prosecutor stated that at one point young was also a potential suspect. the prosecutor november 1st by homicide detectives. . . .the prosecutor then read from the transcript of the interview and saigood. no evidence is coming from this exchange. police do not stop questioning a suspect simply because he denies involvement, although that is by no means clear. whatever the statements, however, settle did nothing more than adamantly deny involvement in the murder and arson. under these found harmless under the chapman standard if a thorough examination of the record demonstrates beyond a reasonable doubt that a rational jury would have found the defendant guilty absent the error. (see neder v. united states (1999) 527 u.s. 1, 15 [119 s.ct. 1827, 144 l.ed.2d 35]; people v. gonzalez (2012) 54 cal.4th 643, 663.) 14 circumstances the admission of settlestatements was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. 2. the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying s for mistrial a. relevant proceedings at a pretrial conference defense counsel requested the witnesses be advisehis parole status at the time he was alleged to have committed the charged offenses. the court granted the request and advised the prosecutor to admonish the witnesses to comply with the during the direct examination of trishia duer, a thousand elms resident and a friend of settledid you tell detectives that when richard learned that you had called 911 he began . . . crying, and richard said he knew he would be already upset and crying, but because of his past, he was concerned that because of his past it would make the present defense counsel immediately requested a sidebar conference. outside the presence of the jury the court observed that the court attempted to resolve the matter by directing the prosecutor to remind the criminal history. defense counsel moved for a mistrial because, in his view, comment was not innocuous and would inevitably lead the jury to speculate as to what settlewas. the court denied the 15 ty james al-kassab to testify. during the direct examination al-kassab testified he had been dispatched to thousand elms on october 31, 2015 to locate settle. asked whether he was provided wal-by name who to look for, but we had to look up a picture of the defendant i believe defense counsel renewed his motion for mistrial, arguing that al-prejudicial because it would lead the jury to infer that settle had suffered a prior arrest. the court offered to admonish the jury to disregard the reference and to remind them there was no evidence settle had any criminal history. defense counsel declined the offer for an admonition in order not to highlight the reference. the court denied the motion. to cure any possible proposal to inquire whether al-kassab had used departmental resources to try and obtain a photograph of settle prior to driving to thousand elms. al- the prosecutor ental resources can include a . . . dmv al-kassab again responded affirmatively. ction, his defense counsel moved for a new trial, arguing the court had erred in denying his second motion for mistrial. settle insisted booking photo was incurably prejudicial because it caused the jury to infer he had suffered a prior arrest and was therefore a 16 criminal capable of killing his grandmother. the court denied the motion, ruling the brief reference to the booking photo in no prejudiced the rights of the de the court also emphasized it had offered to admonish the jury to disregard the reference, but defense counsel declined the offer. b. governing law and standard of review of receiving a fair trial has been irreparably (people v. bolden (2002) 29 cal.4th 515, 555 (bolden); accord, people v. gonzales and soliz (2011) 52 cal.4th 254, 291 the defendant will suffer prejudice that is incurable by ].) of the triapeople v. harris (1994) 22 cal.app.4th 1575, 1580.) circumstances, provide the basis for a finding of incurable (people v. ledesma (2006) 39 cal.4th 641, 683; see people v. rices (2017) [a] court should grant a defendant has been prejudiced in a way that an admonition or but a brief and nonresponsive statement may generally be cured by admonishment.

(see people v. hill (1998) 17 cal.4th 800, 844-844 in some circumstances rise by accretion to the level of reversible people v. rivas (2013) 214 cal.app.4th errors settle has alleged, even when considered cumulatively, claim of cumulative error. 19 3. a limited remand is appropriate a. remand is appropriate for the trial court to correct sentencing errors and to consider whether to dismiss or strike five-year sentencing enhancements as discussed, settle was sentenced to an indeterminate term of 30 years to life for second degree murder and a consecutive determinate term of 12 years for arson. the court imposed a five-year enhancement on the murder count pursuant to section 667, subdivision (a), because settle had suffered a prior serious felony conviction and a one-year enhancement because he had served a prior separate prison term for a felony within the meaning of section 667.5, subdivision (b). no enhancements were imposed on the arson count. at the time of setsection 667, subdivision (a), five-year prior serious felony enhancement was mandatory and should have been imposed once to the indeterminate sentence and once to the determinate sentence. (people v. misa (2006) 140 cal.app.4th 837, 846-847 [defendant, a second strike offender, was subject to a prior conviction enhancement under section 667, subdivision (a), on the torture count, which carries an indeterminate sentence, even though he also received a similar enhancement relating to the determinate sentence on the assault count].) similarly, a prior prison term enhancement under section 667.5, subdivision (b), must be applied once to the indeterminate sentence and once to the determinate sentence unless the court elects to strike the enhancement under section 1385. (people v. minifie (2018) 22 subdivision 1170.1, 20 subdivision (prior prison term enhancements under section 667.5, subdivision (b), are to be applied once to the indeterminate sentence and once to the determinate sentence, unless the court sentence imposed was unauthorized.5 although the trial court was obligated to impose two five-year prior serious felony enhancements when it sentenced settle, on september 30, 2018 the governor signed senate bill no. 1393, which, effective january 1, 2019, allows the trial court to exercise discretion to strike or dismiss section 667, subdivision (a), serious felony enhancements. (see stats. 2018, ch. 1013,  1 & 2.) granted discretion to dismiss or strike a prior serious felony enhancement, we remand for the court to consider whether to impose the five-year prior serious felony enhancement or the one-year prior prison term enhancement on both, one or none of the two counts as to which settle was convicted. (see generally people v. garcia (2018) 28 cal.app.5th 961, 973, fn. 3 [remanding [t]he record does not indicate that the 5 people v. scott (1994) 9 cal.4th 331, 354.) an appellate court has an obligation to correct an unauthorized sentence whenever the error comes to its attention, whether or not the error was raised on appeal. (see people v. cunningham, supra, 25 cal.4th 926, 1044-1045.) we advised the parties of our concern that the trial court had imposed an unauthorized sentence and invited them to submit supplemental letter briefs addressing the issue. 21 court wserious felony conviction for sentencing purposes, had the court had the discretion to do so at the time it originally sentenced b. remand is also appropriate for settle to request a hearing on his ability to pay the fees and assessments imposed by the trial court in dueas, supra, 30 cal.app.5th 1157 this court held it violated due process under both the united states and california constitutions to impose a court operations assessment as required by section 1465.8 or the court facilities assessment mandated by government code section 70373, neither of which is intended to be punitive in nature, without first determining the dueas, at p. 1168.) a restitution fine under section 1202.4, subdivision (b), in contrast, is intended to be, and is recognized as, additional punishment for a crime. section 1202.4, subdivision inability to pay may not be considered a compelling and extraordinary reason not to impose the restitution fine; inability to pay may be considered only when increasing the amount of the restitution fine above the minimum required by statute. to avoid the serious constitutional question raised by these provisions, we held, although the trial court is required to impose a restitution fine, the court must stay execution of the fine until it is determined the defendant has the ability to pay the fine. (dueas, at p. 1172.) settle requests we remand the case for the trial court to conduct an ability-to-pay hearing in accordance with our opinion in dueas. the attorney general contends settle forfeited the issue by not raising it at trial. although recognizing we have 22 rejected similar forfeiture arguments in the past (see people v. castellano (2019) announced constitutional principle that could not reasonably have been anticipated at the time of trial, reviewing courts have people v. brooks (2017) 3 parties for failing to raise an issue at trial where an objection would have been futile or wholly unsupported by substantive law should apply in this case because, at the time of his sentencing hearing, settle had an existing right under section 1202.4, subdivision (d), to challenge imposition of a restitution fine above the $300 statutory minimum. although the people are correct settle could have challenged the trial imposition of the restitution and parole revocation restitution fines to the extent they were above the statutory minimum, forfeiture nor application of the forfeiture rule is (people v. mccullough (2013) 56 cal.4th 589, 593; accord, in re s.b. (2004) 32 cal.4th 1287, 1293.) here, neither the trial court nor counsel had the benefit of our decision in dueas, and the court understandably did not advise settle he had a due process right to argue he did not have the ability to pay the various fines and assessments imposed. because we must remand this case in any event to permit the trial court to resolve other sentencing issues, it is appropriate to give settle the opportunity to make a record on remand as to his ability to pay all applicable fines, fees and assessments. (cf. in re s.b., at p. 1293 [the purpose of the 23 forfeiture rule to encourage parties to bring errors to the attention of the trial court, so that they may be disposition s and remand for the trial court to correct its unauthorized sentence and to consider whether to exercise its discretion to dismiss any prior serious felony enhancements. on remand the trial court is to afford settle the opportunity to request a hearing and to present evidence of his ability to pay any applicable fines, fees and assessments. perluss, p. j. we concur: segal, j. feuer, j.
