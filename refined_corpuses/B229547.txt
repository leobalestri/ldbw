(a)). 19 witness while testifying at the hearing and that is offered to prove the truth of the matter numerals. the contents of exhibit 19 implied statements that 24 named persons with specified social security numbers had, e.g., year to date gross earnings and total withholding in specified dollar amounts. the prosecutor argued exhibits 19 through 22 rant; therefore, they were relevant, admissible evidence of the criminal scheme at issue in this case. the prosecutor did not expressly state he was offering the exhibits for their truth. whether or not the implied statements in exhibit 19 were offered for their truth, i.e., to prove said persons in fact existed and to prove the specified information pertaining to each was true, the implied statements were admissible as nonhearsay to prove that the preparer of the exhibit (and also appellant, who possessed it (see fn. 21, ante)) knew income and tax terminology, and knew how to correlate multiple alleged persons with ----received some of the alleged refunds. knowledge was, in turn, admissible to prove (along with other evidence in this case) that, in the present case, appellant in fact correlated persons with false income and/or tax information, and received refunds as a result, i.e., appellant participated in a criminal scheme. similar reasoning applies to exhibits 20 through 22. we believe the reasoning -s cases, and records in bookmaking cases, are admissible as nonhearsay circumstantial evidence to prove narcotics and we note appellant does not challenge the relevance of exhibits 19 through 22. we also note there was substantial evidence appellant possessed them. they were found in office was a suite in which wilson had a smaller office. exhibits 19 through 22 were gonzalez that wilson was the bookkeeper. a trier of fact reasonably could have concluded appellant jointly possessed the exhibits. 20 bookmaking offenses, respectively, is applicable here. (cf. people v. harvey (1991) 233 cal.app.3d 1206, 1219-1223, 1225-1226.) exhibits 19 through 22 were not hearsay; instead, they were nonhearsay circumstantial evidence that appellant committed the crimes of which he was convicted. moreover, even if exhibit 19 were not admissible as nonhearsay circumstantial evidence, kang testified in effect that exhibit 19 appeared to have aggregations of information for various returns and refunds, it appeared that whoever prepared the exhibit was keeping track of all of the returns, and it appeared the individual was using the exhibit to keep track of the expected refunds associated with the returns. gonzalez opined at trial that the returns listed in exhibit 19 were part of a fraudulent scheme, and her opinion was based in part on that exhibit. an extrajudicial statement which serves as a basis for expert opinion is nonhearsay. (cf. people v. thomas (2005) 130 cal.app.4th 1202, 1208-1210.) exhibit 19 was a nonhearsay basis for expert opinion testimony concerning what that exhibit was and the fact it was part of a fraudulent scheme. even if exhibits 19 through 22 were hearsay, it does not follow they were evidence of a statement offered against a party is not made inadmissible by the hearsay rule if: [] (a) the statement was made by a person authorized by the party to make a statement or statements for him concerning the subject matter of the statement; and (b) the evidence is offered either after admission of evidence sufficient to sustain a finding of such authority or, in the suite and under the desk of wilson in her office, and appellant told gonzalez that wilson was the boo(merriam-trier of fact reasonably could have concluded from these facts that wilson created those exhibits and was authorized by appellant to do so. we review the admission of evidence pursuant to a hearsay exception under an abuse of discretion standard. (people v. lawley 21 (2002) 27 cal.4th 102, 153.) moreover, where, as here, the trial court overruled any reasoning. (cf. people v. smith (2005) 135 cal.app.4th 914, 923.) even if exhibits 19 through 22 were hearsay, they were admissible under evidence code section 1222. finally, even if exhibits 19 through 22 were inadmissible hearsay, it does not follow we must reverse the judgment. as to counts 1, 4 through 13, and 17 through 19 (which alleged violations of revenue and taxation code section 19705, subdivision (a)(2)), cinvolved darnell willpertain only to tax year 2002,22 any event. accordingly, to the extent counts 1, 4 through 13, and 17 through 19, involved returns for a tax year(s) other than 2002, the admission into evidence of exhibits 19 through 22 was not prejudicial since those counts were proven by ample independent evidence pertaining to that tax year(s) other than 2002. (cf. people v. watson (1956) 46 cal.2d 818, 836.) moreover, we have set forth in our factual summary when exhibits 19 through 22, or any of them, were pertinent evidence as to a count. that summary shows that all of the counts as to all tax years were proven by ample evidence independent of exhibits 19 through 22; therefore, the admission into evidence of those exhibits was not prejudicial as to any count. counts 20 and 23 involved violations of revenue and taxation code section 19721, subdivision (a)(1) based on the issuance in 2001 of refund warrants to frederick 22 see the factual summary pertaining to counts 1, 6, and 12, each of which pertains to a 2002 return. said summary demonstrates that, as to each such count, information in exhibits 19 through 22 correlated with information in a 2002 return. 22 johnson and darnell williams in connection with their respective 2000 returns; therefore, the admission into evidence of exhibits 19 through 22, which pertained to tax year 2002, and exhibit 31, not exhibits 19 through 22. exhibit 31 summarized returns filed, and refunds paid, for tax years 1999 through 2002. the admission into evidence of exhibits 19 through 22 was not prejudicial as to count 32. 2. appellant claims there is insufficient evidence supporting his convictions. we disagree. appellant argues there is insufficient evidence supporting his convictions on counts 1, 4 through 13, and 17 through 19. each of those counts alleged a violation of revenue and taxation code section 19705, subdivision (a)(2) (see fn. 1, ante).23 however, without repeating in detail the evidence in this case, we note there was substantial evidence as follows. appellant, through his businesses (including his six businesses of personnel, sitestars, administrative, recruits, cai, and easy) supplied -s reflecting amounts for withholding for various alleged employees. appellant told gonzalez that appellant was responsible for preparing the none of the above six businesses, except administrative, made any withholding payment in any tax year. even administrative had an outstanding tax liability of $201,761. in sum, appellant knew not merely that he virtually never had paid withholding but knew he virtually never had actually withheld state income tax from the alleged -these falsely stated withholding amounts were also reflected on the filed returns of alleged employees, including those whose returns are at issue in counts 1, 4 through 13, and 17 through 19. 23 the court, using a modified calcrim no. 2825, instructed on the elements of this offense. 23 in light of the above, we conclude there was sufficient evidence as to counts 1, 4 through 13, and 1illfully aid[ed] or assist[ed] in, or procure[d], . . . the preparation or presentation under, or in connection with any matter arising under, the personal income tax law . . . of a return, . . . that is fraudulent or is false as to any material matter, whether or not that falsity or fraud is with the knowledge of revenue and taxation code section 19705, subdivision (a)(2). the gravamethe individual claims of wages and losses were false, there is no support for the inference evidence that individual claims of wages, if not losses, were false.24 second, even if the claims of wages and losses on the returns were true, there was support for an inference a fraudulent scheme was afoot. the claimed losses and/or deductions had the effect of negating claimed wages with the result alleged employees claimed they had no taxable income. w-a result, these falsely stated withholding amounts were reflected on the filed returns of alleged employees. even if the alleged employees truthfully claimed on their returns that 24 determined they did not issue any checks to most of the 27 persons listed on exhibit 31. kang reviewed individual folders for returns admitted into evidence at trial. the folders were recovered from the wilshire office. kang did not find in the folders any documents supporting any claimed wage amount. he searched for ledgers, cancelled checks, payroll stubs, and/or employment agreements reflecting wages paid to any of the people referred to in the returns reviewed during trial, and he found no such documents. kang reviewed various documents seized from the wilshire office and testified to the effect they did not indicate that wages or payments had been made to anthony, who was in prison. correspondence from anthony to appellant did not discuss work-related matters. return. 24 said employees had no taxable income, nonetheless, their returns, as far as appellant was concerned, falsely and fraudulently claimed withholding, and those false and fraudulent withholding claims resulted in refunds.25 appellant argues there is insufficient evidence supporting his convictions on counts 20 and 23, each of which alleged a violation of revenue and taxation code section 19721, subdivision (a)(1) (see fn. 2, anteevidence of filing a false return is insufficient, the evidence of a violation of [the above subdivision] must, necessarily, also be insufficient.revenue and is insufficient evidence supporting his convictions for violations of revenue and taxation code section 19721, subdivision (a)(1) (counts 20 & 23) fails. appellant finally argues there is insufficient evidence as to his conviction for grand theft of personal property exceeding $400 in value (count 32) becauagain, as in the counts of violating revenue and taxation code sections 19705 and 25 appellant was entitled to exercise his right to present no defense evidence and to rest on the state of the evidence. however, appellant presented defense evidence and, once appellant did so, the jury was entitled to consider it. in the present case, the jury reasonably could have concluded the defense evidence was weak on various issues, including whether appellant, through his businesses, falsely and fraudulently reported wages, and especially whether he falsely and fraudulently reported withholding. the jury was entitled to consider this when evaluating all of the evidence and, here, convicting instruction (per calcrim no. 355) that appellant had an absolute constitutional right not to testify, and that the jury was not to consider or discuss the fact he did not testify. 25 disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports
