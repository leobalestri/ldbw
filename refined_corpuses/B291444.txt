(a)(1)) pursuant to senate bill no. 1393, which became effective january 1, 2019. senate bill no. 1393 amended section 1385 to permit a trial court to strike a prior serious felony conviction enhancement. we find no remand is required. background anchondo shot and killed two men following an argument with one of the victims. the next day, police officers observed anchondo driving a vehicle which belonged to one of the victims. when they attempted to stop him, anchondo sped away. the police pursuit ended when anchondo crashed into multiple vehicles, injuring the driver of one of the vehicles. a jury convicted anchondo of two counts of first degree murder ( 187, subd. (a)) and one count of evading a peace officer causing serious bodily injury (veh. code,  2800.3, subd. (a)). the jury found true the firearm allegations attached to the murder counts ( 12022.53, subds. (b)-(d)) and the multiple murder 1 unless otherwise specified, all statutory references are to the penal code. 3 special circumstance ( 190.2, subd. (a)(3)). the trial court found true the allegation that anchondo suffered three prior strike convictions ( 667, subds. (b)-(j), 1170.12) including one prior serious felony conviction ( 667, subd. (a)). on the murder counts, the trial court sentenced anchondo to two consecutive terms of life without the possibility of parole, plus two consecutive terms of 25 years to life on the firearm enhancements and two consecutive five-year enhancements for the prior serious felony conviction. the court imposed a consecutive upper term of 14 years for the conviction of evading a peace officer. s. however, we remanded the case with directions that the trial court hold a hearing to determine whether to strike the firearm use enhancements. (people v. anchondo (mar. 22, 2018, b283015) [nonpub. opn.].) [anchondo] consecutively at the time of sentencing so that is had found there were circumstances in aggravation: the crimes involved great violence; there was great bodily harm; anchondo engaged in violent conduct and his prior convictions were numerous and increasing in seriousness; he had served prior prison terms; and he was on parole at the time he committed the crimes. the court had found no circumstances in mitigation. the court added exemplary the court stated sentencing pursuant to the rules of court but just the underlying here the mitigation of having 4 that is reflective of the conduct that was exhibited here and found by the jury to have been committed by mr. anchondo. so, in discussion section 1385 provides the trial court with discretion to strike an enhancement in the furtherance of justice. at the time of sentencing, former subdivision (b) of that section provided: conviction of a serious felony for purposes of enhancement of a te bill no. 1393 deleted former subdivision (b). (stats. 2018, ch. 1013,  2.) senate bill no. 1393 applies retroactively to anchondo because the judgment in this case is not yet final. (people v. garcia (2018) 28 cal.app.5th 961, 973; see people v. brown (2012) 54 cal.4th 314, 319-324.) where the trial court is sentence, is required unless the record reveals a clear indication that the trial court would not have reduced the sentence even if at the time of sentencing it had the discretion to do so. [citation.] (people v. almanza (2018) 24 cal.app.5th 1104, 1110; see people v. gutierrez (1996) 48 cal.app.4th 1894, would not, in any event, have exercised its discretion to lessen the sentence anchondo argues a remand is required because (1) the court did not state on the record that it would not have exercised 5 its discretion to strike the enhancements even if it had discretion to do so; and (2) the fact the court chose not to exercise its discretion to strike the firearm enhancements does not compel a conclusion that it would also choose not to strike the prior serious felony enhancements. we disagree. enhancements, the trial court noted that it sentenced anchondo consecutively because there were numerous circumstances in aggravation and no circumstances in mitigation. it characterized on the firearm enhclear indication that the trial court would not have reduced even if at the time of sentencing it had the discretion to do so.people v. almanza, supra, 24 cal.app.5th at p. 1110.) disposition the order is affirmed. not to be published johnson, j. we concur: rothschild, p. j. bendix, j.
