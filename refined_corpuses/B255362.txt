(health & saf. code,  11377, subd. (a).) the trial court sentenced him to a third strike term of 25 years to life. on june 19, 2013, defendant filed a petition for recall of sentence pursuant to penal code section 1170.126,1 alleging his commitment offense was not a serious or violent felony. the trial court denied the petition, explaining one of defendants prior convictions was for forcible rape ( 261(2)), which is a disqualifying offense pursuant to section 667, subdivision (e)(2)(c)(iv)(i) and made defendant ineligible for resentencing pursuant to section 1170.126, subdivision (e)(3). defendant filed a timely appeal and we appointed counsel to represent him. after examination of the record, counsel filed an opening brief raising no issues and asking this court to independently review the record pursuant to people v. wende (1979) 25 cal.3d 436, 441. on may 29, 2014, we sent letters to defendant and appointed counsel, directing counsel to forward the appellate record to defendant and advising defendant that within 30 days he could personally submit any contentions or issues he wished us to consider. to date he has not responded. discussion 1. appealability proposition 36, known as the three strikes reform act of 2012, was approved on november 6, 2012, and went into effect the next day. it amended sections 667 and 1170.12 so that an indeterminate term of 25 years to life in prison is applied only where 1 all further statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise indicated. 3the third strike offense is a serious or violent felony or the prosecution pleads and proves an enumerated factor. ( 667, subd. (e)(2)(c), 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(c).) proposition 36 also created section 1170.126, which provides a procedure for resentencing persons presently serving an indeterminate term of imprisonment under the three strikes law whose sentence under this act would not have been an indeterminate life sentence. ( 1170.126, subd. (a).) such a person may file a petition to recall his or her sentence and be sentenced as a second strike offender. ( 1170.126, subd. (b).) an inmate is eligible for such resentencing if none of his or her commitment offenses constituted serious or violent felonies. ( 1170.126, subd.
