(a)(2)), criminal threats (pen. code,  422), and carrying a loaded firearm/prior conviction (pen. code,  12031, subd. (a)(1)). the people subsequently amended the complaint to add a count of penal code section 12021, subdivision (a)(1), and one count of penal code section 12031, subdivision (a)(2)(b). cardenas pled guilty to the penal code section 12021, subdivision (a)(1) count. he admitted suffering a prior felony conviction in 1988 for a violation of vehicle code section 23153, subdivision (a). in april 2015, cardenas sought resentencing under proposition 47. the trial court denied the petition. at a hearing on the petition, the court explained the matter was not eligible for resentencing under proposition 47. discussion on appeal, cardenas appears to argue the trial court erred in denying his petition for resentencing because the court disregarded the statute. we find no such error. proposition 47 makes certain drug- and theft-related offenses misdemeanors, unless the offenses were committed by certain ineligible defendants. these offenses had previously been designated as either felonies or wobblers (crimes that can be punished as either felonies or misdemeanors). [to this end,] proposition 47 (1) added chapter 33 to the government code ( 7599 et seq.), (2) added sections 459.5, 490.2, and 1170.18 to the penal code, and (3) amended penal code sections 473, 476a, 496, and 666 and 1 penal code section 12021, subdivision (a) has been recodified as penal code section 29800, subdivision (a). 3 health and safety code sections 11350, 11357, and 11377. (voter information guide, gen. elec. (nov. 4, 2014) text of prop. 47,  4-14, pp. 70-people v. rivera (2015) 233 cal.app.4th 1085, 1091.) cardenas was convicted of a violation of former penal code section 12021, subdivision (a)(1). proposition 47 applies to defendants who have been convicted of violations of health and safety code sections 11350, 11357, or 11337 or penal code sections 459.5, 473, 476a, 490.2, 496 or 666. (pen. code,  1170.18, subd. (a).) argument that a violation of former penal code section 12021, subdivision (a)(1) is not a serious or violent felony or sex offense requiring registration. (pen. code,  1170.18, subd. (i) [proposition 47 does not apply to defendants convicted of crimes specified in pen. code,  290, subd. (c), 667, subd. (e)(2)(c)(iv)].) proposition 47 only allows for resentencing defendants convicted of the crimes enumerated in the statute. penal code section 12021, subdivision (a)(1) (now penal code section 29800, subdivision (a)) is not one of those crimes. thus, the trial court correctly determined cardenas was not eligible for resentencing under proposition 47 with respect to the penal code section 12021, subdivision (a)(1) conviction.
