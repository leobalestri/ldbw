(d)(1)).1 it was specially alleged sullivan had personally used a firearm within the meaning of sections 12022.53, subdivision (b), and 12022.5, subdivisions (a) and (d). 2. evidence at trial on the morning of december 27, 2015 a los angeles eputy discovered his badge, credit card and loaded handgun had been stolen from his vehicle in la habra. he notified the la habra police department, which soon identified sullivan as a suspect in the theft. that evening la habra police officer michael costanzo was on patrol in a marked police car when he received a radio call from two detectives who had sullivan under surveillance. the detectives 1 statutory references are to this code. 3 stated sullivan was leaving his current location and they needed a patrol car to conduct a traffic stop on the vehicle sullivan was driving. costanzo proceeded to the provided location, identified after following sullivan for a few minutes, costanzo activated the lights on his patrol car to facilitate the traffic stop. rather than pull over immediately, sullivan continued down the street and turned into a residential driveway. costanzo stopped his patrol car his car, he saw sullivan leave his car and noticed sullivan had a gun in his hand. sullivan immediately ran away from costanzo toward the garage at the end of the driveway. costanzo unholstered his weapon, ran after sullivan and shouted at him to stop and get on the ground. sullivan ran to an area next to the garage where costanzo saw him attempt to climb over some debris. sullivan lost his footing, stopped and pointed the gun at afraid sullivan was going to shoot him, costanzo fired his weapon at sullivan, hitting him in the elbow. after being hit sullivan threw his gun behind him. when costanzo approached sullivan, sullivan said he was sullivan testified in his own defense. he admitted to having received the stolen weapon from a friend on december 27, 2015 and said he intended to trade the gun for methamphetamine. sullivan explained that, when he saw the patrol car turn on its lights behind him, he panicked. when he got out of his car, he intended to run behind the garage and throw the gun away. sullivan denied pointing the gun at 4 instead, he insisted, he had lifted his arm to throw the gun behind him when costanzo fired. 3. the motion for mistrial during its case-in-chief the prosecution presented the testimony of the investigating officer, detective chad hoeppner of the whittier police department. the prosecutor showed hoeppner a booking photograph of sullivan to demonstrate the difference between suland at the time of trial; hoeppner testified sullivan was thinner identification, defense counsel requested a sidebar. defense counsel stated she had thought the prosecutor would be introducing a department of motor vehicles photograph not a booking photograph; however, the prosecutor reminded defense counsel she had shown her both photographs earlier that day. defense counsel withdrew any objection. during her cross-examination of detective hoeppner defense counsel asked when the booking photograph was taken. defense counsel objected, and the trial court sustained the objection. the a sidebar both the court and defense counsel expressed their prior understanding the photograph had been booking for the december 27, 2015 incident. the prosecutor clarified it had been taken approximately six months earlier. was highly prejudicial and requested the court declare a mistrial. 5 the court declined, stating it believed any prejudice could be cured. after the sidebar concluded, the trial court again that the portion, the part about possible arrest, that language is stricken from the record. that means you cannot consider it in 4. the verdict and sentence sullivan was convicted of assault with a firearm on a peace officer, and the jury found true the special allegations that sullivan had used a firearm during the assault within the meaning of sections 12022.53, subdivision (b), and 12022.5, subdivisions (a) and (d). the court sentenced sullivan to the upper term of eight years for the assault and struck the firearm enhancement pursuant to section 12022.53, subdivision (b) (see  1385, 12022.53, subd. (h)). the court did not address the section 12022.5 enhancement based on its belief that section 12022.5 did not apply in this case because use of a firearm was an element of the assault.2 2 allegation, the way it was pled and it was presented to the jury for verdict, they found the gun allegation to be true under 12022.53(b) as well as 12022.5 . . . (a) and (d). . . . and so i thought, well, maybe that was an exception for an assault on a peace officer with a firearm as it is for 53 because the use of the firearm is an element of the offense. but i think we are all in agreement that it was probably something that is the way the and looking at the statute it does not apply . . . . i think the 53 which is a 10-year enhancement is the only one that applies in 6 after the trial court pronounced the sentence, defense counsel requested the court recommend sullivan be placed in fire camp. the court agreed. the court then advised sullivan of his right to appeal; and sullivan respon the court proceeded to hear other matters but went back on the record later that day in this matter discussion 1. the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion for mistrial apprised of prejudice that it judges incurable by admonition or people v. collins (2010) 49 cal.4th 175, 198 (collins).) a witnesss volunteered statement can, under some circumstances, provide the basis for a finding of incurable people v. ledesma (2006) 39 cal.4th 641, 683.) however, uries often hear unsolicited and inadmissible comments and in order for trials to proceed without constant mistrial, it is axiomatic the prejudicial effect of these comments may be corrected by judicial admonishment . . . people v. mcnally (2015) 236 cal.app.4th 1419, 1428-1429.) it is only in the improper subject matter is of such a character that its effect . . . cannot be remos ibid.) thus, a motion for mistrial should be people v. bolden (2002) 29 cal.4th 515, 555.) 7 whether particular is incurably prejudicial is by its nature a speculative matter, and the trial court is vested with considerable discretion in ruling on mistrial mocollins, supra, 49 cal.4th at p. 199.) accordingly, we review the trial people v. avila (2006) 38 cal.4th 491, 573; people v. bolden, supra, 29 cal.4th at p. 555.) sullivan had been arrested prior to the current offense was incurably prejudicial. in support of his argument sullivan relies on two decades-old statement that the defendant had suffered a prior conviction and/or served time in prison was incurable by admonition. (see people v. ozuna -admonition]; people v. figuieredo (1955) 130 cal.app.2d 498, 506 for new trial].) unlike the testimony in ozuna and figuieredo, howeverjury was not told whether sullivan had been convicted of any offense, let alone charged. nor was the jury told the nature of the incident leading to the arrest. the supreme court has repeatedlyand more recently than the decisions sullivan citesfound that any prejudice criminality can be cured by appropriate admonition to the jury. for example, in collins, supra, 49 cal.4th 175, a witness testified ever since he was arrestedsusanville before he got out.(id. at pp. 196- 8 motion for mistrial but offered to strike that portion of the testimony and give the jury a limiting instruction. defense counsel declined the offer out of fear of highlighting the testimony s] remarks ambiguous. the court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that any id. at p. 199; see also people v. avila, supra, 38 cal.4th at pp. 572-574 [any prejudice arising from fendant had by though you had never heard it. you shall not consider it for any purpose. in your deliberations you may not discuss or consider people v. valdez (2004) 32 in jail did not warrant mistrial]; people v. franklin (2016) 248 d fleeting here, the trial court struck the testimony and admonished the jury to disregard detective prior arrest, stating it could not be considered in any way as evidence. the trial court also instructed the jury pursuant to record you must disregard it and must not consider that l court that, under the circumstances of this case, the instructions and admonishments were sufficient to cure any prejudice. (see people v. gonzales and soliz (2011) 52 cal.4th 254, ere, the trial court struck berber's testimony and properly admonished the 9 jury. although soliz asserts the admonitions were inadequate, we see no basis for the assertion and presume, as always, that people v. yeoman that jurors ].) 2. o address the section 12022.5 firearm enhancement requires a remand for resentencing the trial court was correct that a firearm enhancement pursuant to section 12022.5 generally cannot be imposed if use of a firearm is an element of the underlying offense (see  12022.5, subd. commission of a felony or attempted felony shall be punished by an additional and consecutive term of imprisonment in the state prison for 3, 4, or 10 years, unless use of a firearm is an element of tha), but erred in concluding section 12022.5 did not apply in this case. section 12022.5, subdivision (d), creates an exception for convictions of assault pursuant to section 245: notwithstanding the limitation in subdivision (a) relating to being an element of the offense, the additional term provided by this section shall be imposed for any violation of section 245 if a firearm is used . . . a firearm on a peace officer pursuant to section 245, subdivision (d), was subject to the section 12022.5 sentencing enhancement. when, as here, more than one firearm enhancement has been found true, the court generally may not impose more than one additional term of imprisonment for each crime. ( 12022.53, subd. 10 section 12021.5, 12022, 12022.3, 12022.4, 12022.5, or 12022.55 shall not be imposed on a person in addition to an enhancement a section 12022.53 enhancement is imposed, the trial court must impose and stay any other applicable firearm enhancement. (see people v. gonzalez [w]e conclude section 12022.53 requires that, after a trial court imposes punishment for the section 12022.53 firearm enhancement with the longest term of imprisonment, the remaining section 12022.53 firearm enhancements and any section 12022.5 firearm enhancements that were found true for the same crime in the present case, rather than impose the section 12022.53 firearm enhancement, the trial court exercised its discretion to strike the enhancement in furtherance of justice. (see  1385, 12022.53, subd. (h).) in the absence of an imposed sentence pursuant to section 12022.53, the prohibition on sentencing sullivan pursuant to section 12022.5 does not apply. (see people v. morrison case where the jury had also returned true findings of the lesser enhancements under section 12022.53, subdivisions (b) and (c), the striking of an enhancement under section 12022.53, subdivision (d) would leave intact the remaining findings, and an enhancement under the greatest of those provisions would be mandatory unless those findings were also stricken in the was required to either strike the section 12022.5 firearm enhancement in the interests of justice or to impose a sentence under the enhancement. we remand to give the trial court an opportunity to do so. 11 contention the trial court erred in withdrawing its fire camp recommendation is moot. however, we are concerned by the trial intention to exercise his right to appeal. on remand the trial court is directed to consider all the circumstances of this case and appropriate. we trust the court will do so without punishing sullivan for exercising his appellate rights. (see generally in re bower (1985) 38 cal.3d 865, 873 [principles of due process protect a defendant from retaliation for exercising the right to appeal].) disposition the conviction is affirmed, and the matter remanded for resentencing in accordance with this opinion. perluss, p. j. we concur: segal, j. feuer, j.
