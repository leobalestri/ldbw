(a)). he contends, and the attorney general concedes, that the trial court erred in admitting hearsay evidence regarding the estimated repair costs for the damaged window. that testimony was the only evidence showing that the damage to the window amounted to $400 or more, the threshold for a felony conviction. hobbs contends that this court should modify the judgment to reflect a conviction of misdemeanor rather than felony vandalism, or in the alternative, remand for a full retrial of the case. the attorney general contends that the correct remedy is to remand the case for a retrial limited to the issue of the cost of repairs to the window. we agree with the parties that the testimony regarding the replacement value of the window was inadmissible hearsay. we conclude that the proper remedy is to remand the case for a full retrial, and as an alternative to retrying hobbs, the prosecutor should have the option of accepting a modification of the judgment to reflect a conviction of misdemeanor vandalism. procedural background hobbs was charged by an information with felony vandalism causing damage of $400 or more, in violation of penal code section 594, subdivision (a).1 it was alleged that he had been convicted of a serious or violent felony within the 1 a person who damages real property other than his own is guilty of vandalism. (pen. code,  594, subd. (a).) if the damage is over $400, the offense is a felony. (pen. code,  594, subd. (b)(1).) otherwise, the violation is a misdemeanor. (pen. code,  594, subd. (b)(2)(a).) 3 meaning of the three strikes law (pen. code,  667, subds. (b)-(i), 1170.12, subds. (a)-(d)), and that he had served numerous prior prison terms pursuant to section 667.5, subdivision (b). a jury found hobbs guilty, with a specific finding that he caused damage exceeding $400. pursuant to people v. superior court (romero) (1996) 13 cal.4th 497, the trial court struck the specific offense and all but the three most recent section 667.5, subdivision (b) priors. the trial court imposed a sentence of five years in state prison, based on the middle term of two years, plus three, one-year enhancements under penal code section 667.5, subdivision (b). he timely appealed. facts miguel herrera, a chevron gas station cashier, testified at trial that on may 15, 2013, he was working the night shift at the gas station, seated at a cash register behind a bulletproof glass window. he observed hobbs standing in front of the window for an extended period of time and asked him to move. hobbs proceeded to strike the window approximately 10-15 times with what appeared to be a bicycle lock, leaving approximately 10 dents in the glass. deputy sheriff erin higgs responded to a 911 call herrera made while the vandalism was in progress. when the deputy arrived at the gas station, hobbs was found a bicycle lock in his jacket pocket. the gas station manager, afraim matthias, testified that he contacted three companies to provide estimates for the repair of the dented bulletproof glass. when matthias was asked on direct examination about the cost estimates, defense counsel objected on hearsay grounds, but the court overruled the objection. 4 matthias testified that it would cost $3,700 to replace the window. he further testified that the window had not yet been fixed as of the time of trial. no other evidence was introduced regarding the repair costs. discussion i. evidence of estimated cost of repair was inadmissible hearsay the only evidence of the amount of damage to the window came from the testimony of matthias, who testified that he contacted three companies to provide repair estimates, it would cost $3,700 to fix the window. the written cost estimates obtained by the gas station manager were inadmissible hearsay under evidence code section 1200, subdivision (a). (pacific gas & e. co. v. g.w. thomas drayage etc. co. (1968) 69 cal.2d 33, 4243 are inadmissible independently to prove that liability for the repairs was incurred, that payment was made, or that the charges were reasonable. testimony summarizing those estimates likewise amounted to inadmissible hearsay. (lebrun v. richards (1930) 210 cal. 308, 319320 [although a property owner may testify as to his opinion of the value of his propertythe cost of repairs, especially where such testimony is merely a repetition of the statemen; mccoy v. gustafson (2009) 180 cal.app.4th 56, 111, fn. 26 [property owner not entitled to read construction s excavation estimate to jury]; kitchel v. acree (1963) 216 cal.app.2d 119, 125 [testimony of homeowner concerning cost to repair defective work, based on estimate from contractor, was inadmissible hearsay]; garfinkle v. montgomery (1952) 113 cal.app.2d 149, 158- 5 ; woolridge v. j.f.l. electric, inc. (2002) 96 cal.app.4th supp. 52, 56 [car s testimony as to cost of repair that was based on third party estimate was inadmissible hearsay].) therefore, as the attorney general concedes, the trial court erred in admitting testimony that it would cost $3,700 to fix the window. ii. remedy for erroneous admission of hearsay evidence absent the erroneously admitted testimony from the manager, the prosecution offered no evidence that the damage to the window exceeded $400. he erroneously admitted testimony, the evidence at trial was insufficient to support the finding of felony vandalism. hobbs contends that we should exercise our discretion pursuant to penal code section 1260 to modify the judgment to reduce his conviction to misdemeanor vandalism (pen. code,  594, subd. (b)(2)(a)), a lesser included offense of felony vandalism.

(lockhart v. nelson, supra, 488 u.s. at p. 40; story, supra, 45 cal.4th at pp. 1296-1297.) to reduce the judgment of conviction to misdemeanor vandalism, but rather to reverse the conviction.2 in the original trial, the prosecutor properly relied (erroneous) ruling admitting the hearsay evidence and did not seek to introduce cumulative evidence of the repair costs. (people v. harvey (1984) 163 cal.app.3d 90, 107 [ 2 hobbs also contends that this court has discretion under penal code section 1181, subdivision 6 to modify the judgment to reflect a misdemeanor conviction. that degree of the crime of which he was convicted, but guilty of a lesser degree thereof, or of a lesser crime included therein, the court may modify the verdict, finding or judgment 1182, subd. 6.) however, in moving for a new trial, hobbs did not raise the issue of the inadmissible hearsay being the sole evidence supporting the finding of damages over $400. moreover, he withdrew the motion. thus, he forfeited the argument based on penal code section 1181, subdivision 6. further, even if he had not forfeited the argument, we would reach the same result as above, and conclude that reversal of the conviction, rather than a reduction of the offense to a misdemeanor, is the appropriate remedy here. 8 should be entitled to rely on that ruling in deciding not to introduce other available evidence which might be cumulative, confusing or perhaps not as persuasiveat a retrial, the people may introduce other, non-hearsay evidence of the repair costs that it chose not to introduce at the first trial. however, contrary to the attorney generalcontention, we may not properly order a limited retrial, in which only the issue of damages is tried. rather, we agree with hobbs that a full retrial is required. where the record on appeal discloses trial error affecting the fairness and reliability of the guilt determination process, the normal remedy is outright reversal; in that instance it would usually minor, supra, 104 cal.app.3d at p. 199.) this situation trial is free of prejudicial error and the appeal prevails on a challenge which establishes only the existence of an unresolved question which may or may not late courts may direct the trial court to take evidence and conduct proceedings limited to the determination of that unresolved question. (ibid.; see people v. gaines (2009) 46 cal.4th 172, 180 [[w]hen the validity of a conviction depends solely on an unresolved or improperly resolved factual issue which is distinct from issues submitted to the jury, such an issue can be determined at a separate post-judgment hearing and if at such hearing the issue is resolved in favor of the people, the conviction may stand. [citation.]].) vandalism. as such, a full retrial on all the elements of the offense, rather than a limited retrial on the issue of damages, is required. 9 en a greater offense must be reversed, but a lesser included offense could be affirmed, we give the prosecutor the option of retrying the greater offense, or accepting a reduction to the lessepeople v. kelly (1992) 1 cal.4th 495, 528; see people v. woods (1992) 8 cal.app.4th 1570, 1596.) if, after the filing of the remittitur in the trial court, the people do not bring hobbs to retrial within the time limit of penal code section 1382, subdivision (a)(2) on the charged offense of felony vandalism, the trial court shall proceed as if the remittitur constituted a modification of the judgment to reflect a conviction of the lesser included misdemeanor offense of misdemeanor vandalism, and shall resentence hobbs accordingly.
