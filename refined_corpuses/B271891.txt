(a)) and an allegation that that both crimes were committed for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with a criminal street gang ( 186.22 subd. (b)(1)(c). as part of the plea agreement, maldonado signed and initialed a multi-page form entitled, lea form, with explanation and waiver of rights (plea form). among other things, maldonado acknowledged the following on the plea funderstand that if i am not a citizen of the united states, my plea of guilty or no contest may or, with certain offenses, will result in my deportation, exclusion from reentry to the united states, and denial of naturalization and amnesty and that the appropriate consulate may be informed of my conviction. the offenses that will result in such immigration action include, but are not limited to, an aggravated felony, conspiracy, a controlled substance offense, a firearm offense, and, under certain circumstances, a moral (italics added.) maldonado also acknowledged on the plea form that [b] ces of this plea, including the immigration consequences (italics added.) 1 all further statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise indicated. 3 citizen of the united states, your conviction in this case will result in your deportation, exclusion from the united states, and denial (italics added.) the prosecutor also asked whether maldonado had a chance to discuss immigration consequences with his attorney, and he replied, understanding that the district attorney would not extend any plea offer without immigration consequences in this case. the trial court found that maldonado had that he had entered into the plea freely and voluntarily with an understanding of the nature plea and imposed the agreed-upon sentence of three years in state prison. ii. the motion to vacate on december 7, 2015, and again on december 23, 2015, maldonado filed substantively identical written motions to withdraw his plea and vacate the judgment pursuant to section 1016.5given proper warnings warned that a conviction under said code section would likely result in removal proceedings . . . he argued that the section 1016.5 the special forms of relief from removal, including cancellation of removal and asylum . . . . in support of his motion, maldonado submitted a declaration in which he stated that he is not a united states citizen and that he had been ordered removed from the country and deemed ineligible for result of his plea. court did not properly advise me that i was subject to detention or possible denial of relief, voluntary departure, bar from reentry, and/or any other conseque he further consequences 4 triggered by my plea, i would not have pled nolo contendere. i would have retained an attorney and taken my case to trial or negotiated another plea. maldonado, however, did not offer any independent, objective evidence to support his assertions about what he would have done differently and/or whether a different plea agreement was possible. on january 6, 2016, the trial court held a hearvacate. out a written waiver, advisory rights waiver and plea form. indicated that he had been advised of and acknowledged certain rights and the consequences ofimmigration hearing, finding that maldonado was advised on the record of the consequences of his plea; that would include deportation, exclusion and would have been looking at a substantial amguilty of both charges and the gang enhancement. given the length of time that had passed since sentencing, the trial court also found that g other things, to the unavailability of witnesses. maldonado timely appealed. discussion i. section 1016.5 and the standard of review section 1016.5, subdivision (a) requires that, before accepting a guilty plea, the [] if you are not a citizen, you are hereby advised that conviction of the offense for which you have been charged may have the consequences of deportation, exclusion from admission to the united states, or denial of naturalization pursuant to the laws of the section 1016.5, subdivision (b) allows a defendant to move to withdraw his plea by this section and the defendant shows that conviction of the offense to which defendant 5 pleaded guilty or nolo contendere may have [the specified adverse immigration] that (1) he or she was not properly advised of the immigration consequences as provided by the statute; (2) there exists, at the time of the motion, more than a remote possibility that the conviction will have one or more of the specified adverse immigration people v. totari (2002) 28 cal.4th 876, 884, italics added; see people v. arendtsz (2016) 247 cal.app.4th 613, 617 (arendtsz).) the defendant bears the burden of demonstrating prejudice. (people v. arriaga (2014) 58 cal.4th 950, 963; people v. martinez (2013) 57 cal.4th 555, 562, 565.) the accused must prove it was reasonably probable he or she would not have entered a guilty, no contest or nolo contendere if properly advised. (martinez, at pp. 562, 565; accord, people v. superior court (zamudio) (2000) 23 cal.4th 183, 210.) our supreme court has explained: stating that he or she would not have entered into the plea bargain if properly advised. it credible, and the court may reject an assertion that is not supported by an explanation or other (martinez, at p. 565; see in re resendiz (2001) 25 cal.4th 230, 253254 s self-serving statement not sufficient to show prejudice]; in re alvernaz (1992) 2 cal.4th 924, 938 [statement of prejudice must be corroborated independently by objective evidence].) the judgment for an abuse of discretion. (arendtsz, supra, 247 cal.app.4th at p. 617; see zamudio, supra, 23 cal.4th at p. 192.) nt (people v. jackson (2005) 128 cal.app.4th 1009, 1018.) a trial courts exercise of discretion will not be disturbed on appeal unless the court exercised it in an arbitrary, capricious, or patently absurd manner resulting in a manifest miscarriage of justice. (baltayan v. estate of getemyan (2001) 90 cal.app.4th 6 1427, 1434.) s exercise of discretion will be reversed (horsford v. board of trustees of california state university (2005) 132 cal.app.4th 359, 393.) ii. the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion maldonado argues that his plea would result in this contention lacks merit. the record reflects that maldonado was properly advised in accordance with section 1016.5 that his plea could have specified immigration consequences, including deportation. in fact, maldonado was expressly advised at his plea hearing that if he was not a citizen, his conviction will result in [his] deportationmoreover, maldonado acknowledged his understanding of these consequences, both verbally at the hearing and in writing on the plea form. even if there had been no oral advisement during the plea hearing, under the law maldonado nonetheless received adequate advisement of the immigration consequences through the plea form and his written acknowledgment that he understood those consequences. uted (people v. ramirez (1999) 71 cal.app.4th 519, 521; see people v. araujo (2016) 243 cal.app.4th 759, 762 [verbal advisement under section 1016.5 not required].) maldonado also , subdivision (a) is t reflect the legislative intent of the and, as a result, ing a noncitizen of the potentially harsh immigration consequences that would result from his or her plea. (boldface & underscore omitted.) maldonado asserts that the court was required to advise him of certain unidentified in making this argument, maldonado relies decision in padilla v. kentucky (2010) 559 u.s. 356, 372374 (padilla)reliance is misplaced. in padilla, the court held a defense attorney provides constitutionally deficient assistance when a noncitizen client is not advised about the risk of deportation resulting from a guilty plea. (id. at pp. 373374.) the padilla defendant 7 argued his counsel was ineffective because the counsel failed to admonish him of the automatic immigration consequences of the plea. (id. at pp. 359360.) padilla held that constitutionally competent counsel would have advised the defendant that his marijuana transportation conviction made him subject to automatic deportation, and remanded the assistance. (id. at pp. 359360, 374375.) the holding in padilla, supra, 559 u.s. 356, does not support the assertion that the trial court erred in denying statutory motion. padillainapplicable in the section 1016.5 context. section 1016.5 does not require notification of mandatory deportation consequences. only the duty of the court to admonish a defendant of the possibility that a conviction may result in removal from the united states, or preclude naturalization [citation], and does not address the (people v. mbaabu (2013) 213 cal.app.4th 1139, 1145, italics added.) section 1016.5 requires only that the court identify three potential immigration consequences of a conviction: may have the consequences of deportation, exclusion from admission to the uni ( 1015, subd. (a), italics added; see arendtsz, supra, 247 cal.app.4th at pp. 618619.) this is a different (and in other words, padilla (arendtsz, supra, 247 cal.app.4th at p. 619.) similarly, we disagree with maldonado 1016.5 compels a broader advisement than what the statute expressly requires. section to promote fairness to such accused individuals by requiring in such cases that acceptance of a guilty plea or plea of nolo contendere be preceded by an appropriate warning of the ( 1016.5, subd. (d), italics added.) override the express (arendtsz, supra, 247 cal.app.4th at 8 p. 618; people v. kim (2009) 45 cal.4th 1078, 1107, fn. 11 [ 1016.5 does not extend beyond its terms]; people v. mbaabu, supra, 213 cal.app.4th at p. 1145 [ 1016.5 does not require advisement of other consequences specified in padilla].) in sum, there is nothing in padilla or under california law, including the adopt a more engaged role when advising a noncitizen of the potentially harsh immigration consequences that would result from his or her plea, advisement of the three major consequences of a plea that are specified in subdivision (arendtsz, supra, 247 cal.app.4th at pp. 618619.) as there was clear evidence at the plea hearing and in the plea form that maldonado entered into his plea agreement with an informed understanding of its immigration consequences, and because maldonado only offered his unsupported, self-serving declaration in support of the motion to vacate, we conclude that the trial court acted in a reasoned and reasonable manner in denying the motion. disposition the order is affirmed. not to be published. johnson, j. we concur: chaney, acting p. j. lui, j.
