( 1170.126.) section 1170.126, the superior court denied the petition on the commission of the current offenses. ( 667, subd. (e)(2)(c)(iii), 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(c)(iii), 1170.126, subd.

(people v. johnson (2015) 61 cal.4th 674, 679, 681 (johnson); people v. burnes (2015) 242 cal.app.4th 1452, 14571458; people v. yearwood (2013) 213 cal.app.4th 161, 167168.) the act amended sections 667 and 1170.12, and added section 1170.126, subdivision (b), authorizing a prisoner serving a third-strike indeterminate life sentence to petition the trial court for recall of the sentence and for resentencing as a second-strike offender. (johnson, at pp. 679680.) not every third-strike offender whose current offense is neither serious nor violent qualifies for resentencing under the act, however. the act disqualifies any inmate whose current with a firearm or deadly weapon.

(e.g.,  1203.06, subd. (b)(3); health & saf. code,  11370.1, subd.

(blakely, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at 7 p. 1052; people v. elder (2014) 227 cal.app.4th 1308, 1313 (elder); people v. white (2014) 223 cal.app.4th 512, 524 (white).) context of section 12022,5 appellant asserts that bland that arming is found if the weapon is available for use at any during see bland, supra, 10 cal.4th at pp. 999, 10011003; see also osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1031.) thus, according to appellant, the definition of arming includes an underlying offense beyond the substantive offense of possession alone. as other courts have observed in responding to the same concerned with imposing an arming enhancementan additional term of imprisonment added to the base term, for which a defendant cannot be punished until and unless convicted of a people v. hicks (2014) 231 cal.app.4th 275, 283 (hicks); osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. conflating the criterial definition of an ineligible offense (being armed during the commission of such offense) with the derivative nature of the armed enhancement (which requires being armed in elder, supra, 227 cal.app.4th at p. 1313; see also osuna, at pp. 10311032.) appellant criticizes osuna and cases following it for during the 5 section 12022 provides for the imposition of an additional in the commission offense. (bland, supra, 10 cal.4th at p. 995.) 8 in the commission of a felony, in bland in the context of section 12022. as osuna explained: internat. dict.

(bland, supra, 10 cal.4th at pp. 999, 10011003; see also osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1031.) appellant acknowledges that appellate courts have consistently rejected his argument that the factors listed in subdivision (iii) must be tethered to another offense, and one the same weapon. he contends, however, that these cases were meaning of subdivision (iii) requires both that the firearm be available and have a facilitative nexus to the crime upon which the defendant has been sentenced. we join the consensus among california courts in holding that the ineligibility factor of being armed with a firearm during the commission of the current offense applies whenever the record shows the defendant was in 10 actual physical possession of the firearm, and therefore decline characterizing sections 12021 and 12031 as -level feloniespurpose of the act to construe subdivision (iii) to deny relief to anyone who had access to a weapon during the commission of a nonviolent crime without requiring that such access be for the purpose of furthering another criminal act. interpreting a voter initiative like [the act], we apply the same princpeople v. rizo statutory construction is to ascertain the intent of the lawmakers in with the language of the statute, to which we give its ordinary meaning and construe in the context of the statutory scheme. if the language is ambiguous, we look to other indicia of voter johnson, supra, 61 cal.4th at p. 682; blakely, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1053.) as set forth above, we find that the act explicitly disqualifies any inmate from resentencing who was armed with a firearm during the unlawful possession of that firearm. (osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1032.) moreover, our reading of the the intent underlying the -risk, nonviolent inmates serving life sentences for petty crimes, such as shoplifting and simple drug possession. (voter information guide, [gen. elec. (nov. 6, 2012)] text of prop. 36,  1, subds. (3), white, supradoors to all third strike offenders whose current convictions were not for serious or violent felonies, but only to those who were 11 perceived as nondangerous or posing little or no risk to the public. a felon who has been convicted of two or more serious and/or violent felonies in the past, and most recently had a firearm readily available for use, simply does not pose little or no risk to osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1038.) appellant argues that having a weapon readily available for usea right protected by the federal constitutionbut as our supreme court has bland, supra, 10 cal.4th at p. 997; brimmer, supra, 230 cal.app.4th at p. 799.) in light of the fact that appellant was armed with a firearm during the commission of his offense, he does not fall into the category of a low-risk, nonviolent offender, and his crime cannot be deemed a petty or minor crime for purposes of resentencing under the act. for these reasons, we reach the same conclusion as all the published decisions to consider the issue: a defendant is ineligible for resentencing under proposition 36 if he was armed at the time he committed the felony of illegal possession of a firearm. (see hicks, supra, 231 cal.app.4th 275; brimmer, supra, 230 cal.app.4th 782; elder, supra, 227 cal.app.4th 1308; osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th 1020; blakely, supra, 225 cal.app.4th 1042; white, supra, 223 cal.app.4th 512.) accordingly, the superior court properly determined that appellant is ineligible for recall and resentencing under proposition 36. 12 disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published. lui, j. we concur: rothschild, p. j. johnson, j.
