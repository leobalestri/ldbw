[] . . . [] . . . he then, while she was on the ground, he then dragged her by the hair . . . about 20 to 30 feet, and he . . . continued to hit and kick her in the back [and] on her head. [] shbegging him to stop. [] . . . [] . . . she said that he deputy zavala described ms. other than possible scrapes on her hands. ms. quilling said her head hurt because defendant had 6 pulled her hair. she also said she had a little bit of pain in her back. she declined to be treated by paramedics. not giving it back. he snatched my hair and dragged me onto the floor. i begged him to please let me go. i just wanted my stuff. he continued to try and hit and kick me. i cried and begged him to stop and release my hair, but he kept going. i felt a little pain . . . in my head from getting my hair pulled. . . . and we have . . . an 11- iii. discussion a. reasonable diligence the sole issue on appeal is whether the prosecution made a good faith effort to secure presence at trial. our supreme court has held: a witness who is in the constitutional sense unless the prosecution to obtain the witnesss presence at the trial. (barber v. page (1968) 390 u.s. 719, 724725 (barber).) the united states supreme court has described the good-faith requirement this way: the law does not require the doing of a futile act. thus, if no possibility of procuring the witness exists (as, for example, the witness intervening death), good faith demands nothing of the prosecution. but if there is a possibility, albeit remote, that affirmative measures might produce the declarant, the obligation of good faith may demand their effectuation. the lengths to which the prosecution must go to produce a witness . . . is a question of reasonableness. [citation.] the ultimate question is whether the witness is unavailable despite good-faith efforts undertaken prior to trial to locate and present that witness. (ohio v. roberts (1980) 448 u.s. 56, 74, disapproved on another point in crawford v. washington (2004) 541 u.s. 36, 6068.) [] our evidence code features a similar requirement for establishing a witnesss unavailability. under [evidence code] section 240, subdivision 7 (a)(5) . . . , a witness is unavailable when he or she is [a]bsent from the hearing and the proponent of his or her statement has exercised reasonable diligence but has been unable to procure his or her attendance by the courts process. (italics added.) the term [r]easonable diligence, often called due diligence in case law, connotes persevering application, untiring efforts in good earnest, efforts of a substantial character. (people v. cogswell (2010) 48 cal.4th 467, 477.) considerations relevant to the due diligence inquiry include the timeliness of the search, the importance of the proffered testimony, and whether leads of the witnesss possible location were competently explored. (people v. wilson (2005) 36 cal.4th 309, 341 [relying on cromer, supra, 24 cal.4th at p. 904].) in this regard, california law and federal constitutional requirements are the same.people v. valencia (2008) 43 cal.4th 268, 291292.) [] . . . [] as indicated, to establish unavailability, the prosecution must show that its efforts to locate and produce a witness for trial were reasonable under the circumstances presented. (ohio v. roberts, supra, 448 u.s. at p. 74; people v. smith (2003) 30 cal.4th 581, 609 (smith ).) we review the trial courts resolution of disputed factual issues under the deferential substantial evidence standard (cromer, supra, 24 cal.4th at p. 902), and independently review whether the facts demonstrate prosecutorial good faith and due diligence (id. at pp. 902-903).(people v. herrera (2010) 49 cal.4th 613, 622-623; accord, people v. fuiava (2012) 53 cal.4th 622, 674-675.) efforts to locate ms. quilling began immediately after the june 30, 2014 hearing. it was at that point clear she might not appear for trial. and repeated efforts to reach her by telephone had failed. prior to that time, ms. kurs knew ms. quilling was a reluctant witness. as noted, ms. quilling failed to respond to the june 30 subpoena. until that point, ms. kurs had no reason to believe ms. quilling would not appear to testify. ms. quilling had appeared at the preliminary hearing. ms. quilling had appeared at the june 5, 2014 hearing. ms. quilling had acknowledged she was obligated to testify and was placed on call. ms. quilling had provided ms. kurs with a telephone number. after the june 30, 2014 hearing, with trial set to start only three days later, investigators went 8 s department records in three counties to determine whether ms. quilling was in custody. moreover, as discussed prosecution acted in good faith and exercised reasonable diligence in attempting to secure even if the prosecutor failed to exercise due diligence in locating the victim, any error was harmless beyond a reasonable n the testimony of the three eyewitnesses and deputy zavala as well as the videotape. that ny significant way. no defense witnesses were called to testify. any alleged error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. b. presentence custody credit the trial court granted defendant 144 days of presentence custody credit and 144 days of conduct credit. however, defendant was arrested on march 2, 2014, and sentenced on july 24, 2014. therefore, he was entitled to a presentence custody credit of 145 days. (people v. rajanayagam (2012) 211 cal.app.4th 42, 48; people v. morgain (2009) 177 cal.app.4th 454, 469.) the judgment must be modified and the abstract of judgment amended to so provide. (people v. chilelli (2014) 225 cal.app.4th 581, 591; people v. morgain, supra, 177 cal.app.4th at p. 470.) defendant asserts he is also entitled to 145 days of conduct credit. however, pursuant to section 4019, subdivisions (b), (c) and (f), defendant is entitled to two days of conduct credit for every two days spent in local custody. in other words, conduct credits are given in two-day increments. (people v. whitaker (2015) 238 cal.app.4th 1354, 1358; people v. chilelli (2014) 225 cal.app.4th 581, 588; people v. smith (1989) 211 9 cal.app.3d 523, 527.) defendant is not entitled to conduct credit for the extra day. (ibid; people v.chilelli, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 588.) c. court facility and security assessments the trial court imposed a $30 court facilities assessment (gov. code,  70373, subd. (a)(1)) and a $40 court security assessment ( 1465.8, subd. (a)(1)). however, the court was required to impose those assessments as to both counts 1 and 4 even though count 4 was stayed. (people v. sencion (2012) 211 cal.app.4th 480, 484; people v. crittle (2007) 154 cal.app.4th 368, 370-371.) the judgment must be modified and the abstract of judgment amended to so provide. 10 iv. disposition the judgment is modified to reflect $60 in court facilities assessments (gov. code,  70373, subd. (a)(1)) and $80 in court security assessments (pen. code,  1465.8, subd. (a)(1)), and to reflect 145 days of presentence custody credit. the judgment is affirmed in all other respects. upon remittitur issuance, the superior court clerk is to prepare and amended abstract of judgment and deliver a copy of the department of corrections and rehabilitation. not to be published in the official reports turner, p.j. we concur: mosk, j. kriegler, j.
