(pen. code,  1170.126.)1 appellant now appeals from the triamotion for a hearing under people v. superior court (romero) (1996) 13 cal.4th 497 (romero). his counsel filed an opening brief that raised no issues and requested independent review of the record pursuant to people v. wende (1979) 25 cal.3d 436 (wende). on july 24, 2018, we sent appellant a letter informing him of the nature of the brief that had been filed and advising him that he had 30 days to file a supplemental brief setting forth issues he wished this court to consider. appellant has not filed a response with the court. i. background we relate the background facts as set forth in our prior opinion: on november 2, 1997, police conducted a traffic stop of a car in which appellant was a passenger. appellant complied with tscene. while appellant was running, a sheer black nylon sock containing a handgun fell from the waistband of his sweatpants. appellant was apprehended and charged with unlawful 1all further statutory references herein are to the penal code unless otherwise indicated. 3 possession of a firearm by a felon (former penal code  12021, subd. (a)).2 at his jury trial, appellant testified that the gun did not belong to him. according to appellant, the driver dropped the gun into his lap as police approached the vehicle, and he put it in his waistband because he was afraid to discard it while the police were approaching. the jury found appellant guilty of unlawfully possessing the firearm. at a subsequent bench trial, the trial court found true allegations that appellant suffered three prior strike convictions (1993 convictions for robbery, attempted robbery, and burglary). the trial court sentenced appellant to 25 years to life in prison, pursuant to the three strikes law. in 1999, we affirmed his conviction on direct appeal, modifying his sentence only to accurately reflect his precommitment credits and obligatory parole revocation fine. of his sentence pursuant to section 1170.126. we affirmed that denial in an unpublished opinion, people v. daniels (aug. 3, 2015, b259284) (nonpub. opn.). ii. present appeal in 2017, appellant filed a motion seeking a hearing pursuant to romero. he requested that the court exercise its discretion to strike two of the three prior strikes (attempted robbery and burglary) in the interest of justice. he further 2the legislature repealed former penal code section 12021, subdivision (a)(1) effective january 1, 2011, and recodified the statute without substantive change as penal code section 29800, subdivision (a)(1), operative january 1, 2012. (see stats. 2010, c. 711,  6, 10; pen. code,  29800, law revision commission comments.) 4 argued that a romero hearing was warranted because his three circumstances, and occurred at the same time, and the robbery cociting people v. vargas (2014) 59 cal.4th 635 (vargas).3 the court denied the court found that, although his prior strikes arose out of a ach count of robbery and attempted robbery vargas, supra, 59 cal.4th noted that appellant filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus on this issue, which was denied on january 27, 2015. finally, the did make a romero motion at the sentencing hearing and that the trial court denied it. appellant timely appealed. we find no abuse of discretion. (see people v. carmony dismiss or strike a prior conviction allegation is subject to review reliance on vargas is misplaced. in vargas, the defendant was were based on her commission of the same act (forcibly taking the (vargas, supra, 59 cal.4th at p. 645.) the court distinguished 3requested that the court strike two of the strikes. the people opposed, noting that the current incident occurred within six and that the priors involved use of a gun. 5 criminal convictions stemming from the commission of a single act,from (id. at p. 648.) in the former circumstance, but not the latter, the court found demonstrate the trial court was required to dismiss one of them because failure to do so would be inconsistent with the spirit of the three (id. at p. 649.) vargas presented one of extraordinary cases,single qualifying act. (ibid.) here, there is very limited information in the record ior convictions. gunpoint, and attempted to rob a second victim, who had no money. it was therefore not an abuse of discretion for the trial court to conclude that the prior convictions arose from multiple criminal acts, and thus to decline to strike the prior strike convictions. iii. wende review in addition, we have independently reviewed the entire record. we are satisfied that no arguable issues exist and appellant has received effective appellate review of the judgment entered against him.
