(people v. superior court (kaulick) 215 cal.app.4th 1279, 1287 (kaulick).) the people alleged kaulick had suffered two prior convictions for kidnapping, both of which are serious or violent felonies under the three strikes law ( 667.5 & 1170.12). (ibid.) the people further alleged one prior strike ( 667, subd. (a)(1)) and two prior prison term enhancement allegations ( 667.5, subd. (b).) (ibid.) in 2000, a jury convicted kaulick of false imprisonment by violence. (kaulick, supra, 215 cal.app.4th at p. 1287.) the jury did not, however, reach verdicts as to the assault and criminal threats charges, and the court declared a mistrial as to those counts. (id. at pp. 1287-1288.) at a bifurcated bench trial, the 4 court found true the prior conviction and prison term allegations. (id. at p. 1288.) the court sentenced kaulick to a term of 25 years to life for the false imprisonment offense under the three strikes law, and it imposed an additional one-year term for the prison prior enhancement. (kaulick, supra, 215 cal.app.4th at p. 1287.) after pronouncing sentence, the court dismissed counts 2 and 3. (ibid.) 2. proposition 36 proceedings in december 2012, kaulick filed a petition for resentencing under proposition 36. kaulick served the attorney general, but not the district attorney, with the petition, and the trial court granted the petition without receiving opposition from the district attorney. (kaulick, supra, 215 cal.app.4th at p. 1289.) the court resentenced kaulick to a total term of seven years in prison, consisting of the upper term of three years for his false imprisonment conviction, doubled to six years under the three strikes law, plus a one-year prison prior term. (id. at pp. 1290-1291.) because kaulick had already served more than seven years in prison, the court . (id. at p. 1291.) in january 2013, after learning that kaulick was scheduled to be released from prison, the district attorney obtained an immediate stay of the trial . in february 2013, the district attorney filed in this court a petition for writ of resentencing petition without providing the district attorney notice and an opportunity to be heard. (kaulick, supra, 215 cal.app.4th at p. 1291.) in an opinion published in april directed the trial court to vacate its order resentencing kaulick 5 under proposition 36, and to issue a new and different order setting a hearing on the petition. (id. at pp. 13061307.) in september 2013, the people filed an opposition to people conceded that kaulick was eligible for resentencing based on his prior tion should be denied because resentencing him would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. in march 2014, kaulick filed a reply to in march 2015, the people filed a revised opposition in which they changed their eligibility for resentencing. the people argued that kaulick was ineligible for resentencing because he intended to commit great bodily injury during his false imprisonment offense. in may 2015, kaulick filed a reply to tkaulick argued the people should be estopped from arguing he is ineligible for resentencing because the people conceded nearly two years earlier in their first opposition that kaulick was eligible for resentencing. kaulick also argued he was eligible for resentencing because the record of conviction for his false imprisonment conviction did not support a finding that he intended to cause great bodily injury on the victim. on may 21, 2015, the court held a hearing on kaulickpetition and, after hearing argument from both parties, took the matter under submission. on june 2, 2015, the court issued a court concluded that kaulick was ineligible for resentencing under proposition 36, finding by a preponderance of the evidence that he intended to commit great bodily injury to the victim of his false imprisonment offense. kaulick filed a timely appeal. 6 discussion 1. proposition 36 and the sixth amendment kaulick contends he has a sixth amendment right to a jury trial on the issue of eligibility for resentencing under proposition 36. he argues the trial court violated that right when the judge reviewing his petition, and not a jury, found he was ineligible for resentencing. we disagree because the determination of eligibility for resentencing under proposition 36 does not implicate the sixth amendment. as the united states supreme court held in dillon v. united states (2010) 560 u.s. 817, [130 s.ct. 2683, 177 l.ed.2d 271, 285], a defendant does not enjoy a sixth amendment right to have facts found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt with respect to issues that limit the ability of the defendant to have his lawful sentence reduced. (id. at pp. 828829; see kaulick, supra, 215 cal.app.4th at p. 1304.) thus, there is no sixth amendment right to a jury trial on factual issues that determine proposition 36. (see people v. guilford (2014) 228 cal.app.4th 651, 663.) alleyne v. united states (2013) 570 u.s. __ [186 l.ed.2d 314, 133 s.ct. 2151] explained by the california supreme court, alleyne the federal constitutions sixth amendment entitles a defendant to a jury trial, with a beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard of (people v. nunez & satele (2013) 57 cal.4th 1, 39, fn. 6.) the denial of a proposition 36 resentencing petition does not increase the mandatory minimum sentence for a crime. therefore, alleyne does not require that a jury, and not a judge, make the eligibility determination for a resentencing petition filed under proposition 36. 7 2. the standard of proof for a proposition 36 eligibility determination kaulick contends the trial court applied the incorrect standard of proofi.e., preponderance of the evidence instead of beyond a reasonable doubtwhen it found he intended to commit great bodily injury during his false imprisonment offense. in light of our opinion in people v. arevalo (2016) 244 cal.app.4th 836, 847-853 (arevaloconclude the court applied the incorrect standard of proof to its eligibility determination. 2.1. kaulick did not forfeit his challenge to the incorrect standard of proof the people contend kaulick forfeited his challenge to the of the evidence standard to its proposition 36 eligibility determination. specifically, the people point to the fact that at the may 21, 2015 hearing on petition framed the issue of evidence in the record that [kaulick], at the time of committing [the] the people preponderance of the evidence standard to its eligibility determination. we disagree. issue of determination under proposition 36 was (and still is) unsettled. there is a split among the appellate courts as to what standard applies, and the issue is currently before the california supreme court. (see people v. frierson (2016) 1 cal.app.5th 788 8 [preponderance of the evidence standard applies], review granted october 19, 2016, s236728; people v. newman (2016) 2 cal.app.5th 718, 728-732 [same], review granted november 22, 2016, s237491; people v. osuna (2014) 225 cal.app.4th 1020, 1040 [same]; arevalo, supra, 244 cal.app.4th at pp. 847-853 [beyond a reasonable doubt standard applies].) in addition, we acknowledge thatpetition, no appellate court had yet to adopt the beyond a reasonable doubt standard as the appropriate standard of proof for making an eligibility determination under proposition 36. (see newman, supra, 2 cal.app.5th at p. 728.) in light of the foregoing, we conclude kaulick did not forfeit his challenge to the standard to its eligibility determination. (see people v. williams (1998) 17 cal.4th 148, 161, fn. 6.) 2.2. the court applied the incorrect standard of proof to its eligibility determination in arevalo, we held the standard of proof the eligibility stage of its review of a proposition 36 resentencing petition. (arevalo, supra, 244 cal.app.4th at pp. 847-853.) we based our holding in arevalo on two considerations. first, we weighed the due process concerns that are at stake when a court determines whether a defendant is eligible for resentencing. we concluded that a heightened standard of proof should apply the substantial amount of prison time potentially at stake for the defendant seeking resentencing, the risk of potential error stemming from the summary and retrospective nature of the adjudication that will be made at the resentencing eligibility proceeding, and the slight countervailing governmental interest given the peoples opportunity to provide new evidence at any subsequent dangerousness hearing.id. at p. 852.) 9 we next looked to in people v. johnson (2015) 61 cal.4th 674 (johnson), which explains proposition 36 and its purpose. specifically, we relied on the following excerpts from johnson he parallel structure of amendments to the sentencing provisions and resentencing provisions reflects an intent that sentences imposed on individuals with the same criminal history be the same, regardless of whether they are being sentenced or resentenced. both the sentencing scheme and the resentencing scheme provide for a second-strike sentence if the current offense is not a serious or violent felony, and they set forth identical exceptions to the new sentencing rules. ( 667, subd. (e)(2)(c), 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(c), 1170.126, subd. (e)(2), (3).)johnson, supra, 61 cal.4th at p. 686, 189 cal.rptr.3d 794, [t ]he parallel structure of [] sentencing and resentencing provisions appears to contemplate identical sentences in connection with identical criminal histories, unless the trial court concludes that resentencing would pose an unreasonable risk to public safety (id. at p. 687, 189 cal.rptr.3d 794, 352 p.3d 366, italics added.)arevalo, supra, 244 cal.app.4th at p. 853in johnson leads us to conclude that, not only must there be a heightened standard of proof for section 1170.126 resentencing eligibility determinations, but thatin order to safeguard the intended parallel structure of [proposition 36]the heightened ibid.) we acknowledge a distinction between arevalo and the present case. in arevalo, in determining the petitioner was ineligible for resentencing under proposition 36, the trial court found the petitioner commission of the underlying crime, a finding that contradicted the trier of facts previous acquittal of defendant on a charge of 10 possession of a firearm by a felon and a not true finding on an rmed with a . (arevalo, supra, 244 cal.app.4th at pp. 846, 853.) by contrast, in the present case, the jury never made an explicit finding that would determination that kaulick intended to commit great bodily injury when he committed his false imprisonment offense. this distinction does not compel us, however, to depart from arevalo. based on the same considerations discussed in arevalo, which we have outlined above, we conclude the beyond a reasonable doubt standard under proposition 36. the court therefore erred in applying the preponderance of the evidence standard of proof in finding kaulick intended to cause great bodily injury when he committed his false imprisonment offense. denying kincorrect standard of proof to its eligibility determination was harmless. we disagree. even if we were to apply the less stringent harmless error test set forth in people v. watson (1956) 46 cal.2d 818, we cannot find that the court would have made the same order if it had applied the correct standard of proof. in finding kaulick intended to cause great bodily injury to his victim during his false imprisonment offense, the court focused on the that is, the court reasoned that in light of the fact that kaulick caused injuries to his victim, it could be inferred that kaulick intended to cause great bodily injury to his victim. (see people v. phillips (1989) 208 cal.app.3d 1120, 1123-1124 [where a defendant willfully commits an act that causes great bodily injury to his victim, it can be inferred from the fact that the defendant committed such act that he intended to inflict great bodily injury].) 11 substantial (people v. bustos (1994) 23 cal.app.4th 1747, 1755.) generally, lacerations, bruises, or abrasions are people v. washington (2012) 210 cal.app.4th 1042, 10471048; see e.g., people v. escobar (1992) 3 cal.4th 740, 750 [great bodily injury found where the victim suffered over [her] legs, knees, and elbows, injury to her neck and soreness in her vaginal area of such severity that it significantly impaired her ability to wa]; bustos, supra, 23 cal.app.4th at p. a hit to the face and struggle on the floor constituted great bodily injury]; people v. sanchez (1982) 131 cal.app.3d 718, 733 [the victim suffered multiple abrasions and lacerations on her back and neck and had serious swelling and bruising of her right eye and a markedly swollen left cheek, constituting great bodily injury]; people v. mixon (1990) 225 cal.app.3d 1471, 1489 [great bodily injury found where the victim was strangled until she nearly passed out leaving a purple line on her neck, her eyes swelled and her nose bled, she suffered a blow to her head that produced a bump, and her eyes were red and her face was bruised].) here, there is substantial evidence in the record to support example, the officer who examined the victim after the attack testified that she had redness around her neck and a scratch or handprint on one of her arms. at times, however, the victim minimized her injuries. she testified that she only had a scratch on her chin that lasted a few days, and some red marks on her 12 throat. the victim also refused medical treatment and did not describe suffering any prolonged pain or discomfort. in light of injuries, we cannot conclude that the court would have made a finding that kaulick intended to commit great bodily injury against the victim if the court had applied the highest, as opposed to the lowest, standard of proof to its eligibility determination. disposition petition is reversed. the matter is remanded for a new hearing to determine whether kaulick is eligible for resentencing under a beyond a reasonable doubt standard of proof. not to be published in the official reports lavin, j. we concur: edmon, p. j. stratton, j.* * judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
