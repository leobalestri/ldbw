(b)) and giving false information to a peace officer ( 148.9, subd. (a)), but it appears those charges were dismissed. 3 on november 4, 2014, voters enacted proposition 47, which reduced to misdemeanors certain possessory drug offenses and thefts of property valued at less than $950. (see people v. hall (2016) 247 cal.app.4th 1255, 1260.) proposition 47 also created a resentencing provision, section 1170.18, under which persons currently serving felony sentences for the reclassified offenses could petition for resentencing. camera petitioned for resentencing under section 1170.18, seeking reduction of his burglary conviction from a felony to a misdemeanor under the newly-enacted section 459.5. section commercial establishment with intent to commit larceny while that establishment is open during regular business hours, where the value of the property that is taken or intended to be taken does not exceed nine hundred fifty dollars 459.5, subd. (a).) the trial court denied the petition on the ground that camera timely appealed. contentions camera contends the trial court erred in finding his burglary conviction ineligible for resentencing under section 1170.18. respondent argues that section 459.5 does not apply o3 3 the issue of whether section 459.5 is limited to the supreme court. (see people v. gonzales (2015) 242 cal.app.4th 35, review granted february 17, 2016, s231171; people v. vargas 4 discussion this appeal turns on the interpretation of section 459.5. the interpretation of a statute is subject to de novo review on appeal. (see kavanaugh v. west sonoma county union high school dist. (2003) 29 cal.4th 911, 916.) in construing a voter people v. rizo (2000) 22 cal.4th 681, dicator of kwikset corp. v. superior court (2011) 51 (people v. rizo, supra, 22 cal.4th at p. 685.) and we construe the ibid. if the text is ambiguous and supports multiple interpretations, we may then turn to extrinsic sources such as ballot summaries and (kwikset corp. v. superior court, supra, 51 cal.4th at p. 321.) respondent first contends that the voters intended to limit larcenous theft of openly displayed merchandise from a business criminal conduct does not come within the parameters of section imarily (2016) 243 cal.app.4th 1416, review granted march 30, 2016, s232673.) 5 although respondent contends that the voters intended section 459.5 to incorporate the common understanding of shoplifting, the voters didefine it by reference to the common understanding of that into a commercial establishment during regular business hours with the intent to commit larceny, where the value of the property taken or intended to be taken does not exceed $950. respondent urges us to consider the ballot materials to discern voter intent, suggesting ction 459.5. according to respondent, these terms are ambiguous because . . . and it has varying ney, labor, real statute added by proposition 47. we do not find these terms ambiguous merely because they are undefined or are given other definitions in other contexts. (see, e.g., state of california v. continental ins. co. (2012) 55 cal.4th 186, 195 [addressing the [a] term is not ambiguous merely because [the contract] do[es] not define it. [citations.] nor is it ambiguous because a word or phrase isolated from its context is susceptible of more as respondent has not pointed to any legitimate ambiguity the plain meaning of the language governs. (see people v. rivera (2015) 233 cal.app.4th 1085, to mean entry into a commercial establishment during regular 6 business hours with the intent to commit larceny, and we may not revretail store. g, a commercial establishment is one that is primarily engaged in commerce, that is, the buying and selling of goods or services. that commonsense understanding accords with dictionary in re j.l. (2015) 242 cal.app.4th 1108, 1114 [interpreting section 459.5].) respondent does not dispute that a commercial airport such as services to consumers. however, respondent argues that the particular area at issue herethe baggage claimdoes not because transportation services typically are not bought and sold there. however, section 459.5 does not state that only certain areas of a commercial establishment qualify under the statute, and we therefore decline to subdivide businesses into areas that qualify or do not qualify under section 459.5.4 in re j.l., supra, 242 cal.app.4th at 4 respondent also argues that if a defendant enters a room in nor engaged primarily in the sale of goods or services (such as a would not fall within the parameters of section 459.5. because this issue is not before us, we decline to address these facts. 7 p. 1114, and conclude that lax falls within that definition because it is primarily engaged in the selling of transportation services. our conclusion is consistent with tintent in passing proposition 47, misdemeanors instead of felonies for nonserious, nonviolent crimes like petty theft and drug possession, unless the defendant has prior convictions for specified violent or seriou(voter information guide, gen. elec.

(see harris v. superior court (2015) 8 21 cal.3d 208 (collins) for the proposition that when a subsequent change in the law decriminalizes the conduct to which the defendant pleaded, the people are entitled to restore in collins, the defendant pled guilty to one count of non-forcible oral copulation in exchange for dismissal of fourteen other charges. (collins, supra, 21 cal.3d at p. 211.) the legislature then repealed the statute defining that crime, decriminalizing the conduct. (ibid.) the defendant appealed and the supreme court reversed his conviction. (ibid.) the court further held that because the change in law hafundamental assumption underlying the plea bargainthat the people were entitled to reinstate the dismissed counts. (id. at pp. 215216.) the cs total relief from his vulnerability to sentence, the state is substantially (id. at p. 215.) unlike in collins, which involved a fully repealed statute defining a crime, here, proposition 47 reduces crimes from felonies to misdemeanors. in addition, here, camera has not challenged his conviction but has only petitioned to reduce his sentence. on these grounds, collins does not apply to this case. ision in doe v. harris (2013) 57 cal.4th 64 agreements are deemed to incorporate the reserve power of the 242 cal.app.4th 244, review granted february 24, 2016, s231489; people v. perry (2016) 244 cal.app.4th 1251, review granted april 27, 2016, s233287.) 9 state to amend the law or enact additional laws for the public (id. at p. 71.) the law made retroactive to them does not violate the terms of id. at p. 73.) it follows that when a law changes the punishment provided for in a plea agreement, the agreement remains binding. as a result, respondent may not withdraw from the plea agreement and reinstate the dismissed charges against camera. disposition burglary conviction ineligible for relief under section 1170.18 is reversed and the matter is remanded for further proceedings on his petition for resentencing. not to be published in the official reports edmon, p. j. we concur: aldrich, j. stratton, j.* * judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
