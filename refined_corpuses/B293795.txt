(a)(4); count 1) and personally inflicted great bodily injury 1 we base the factual background on the probation report, which in turn was based on the police report. 2 all undesignated statutory references are to the penal code. 3 on a non-accomplice ( 12022.7, subd. (a)). defendant pled not guilty and denied the allegation. on november 14, 2017, defendant withdrew his not guilty plea, entered a negotiated plea of no contest under people v. west (1970) 3 cal.3d 595 to count one, and admitted the related great-bodily-injury allegation. as relevant here, sentencing was delayed to give defendant an opportunity to complete 60 days of community labor and attend 26 anger management classes. if he completed those requirements, defendant could withdraw his admission to the allegation. either way, the court would suspend probation, with time served, on the same terms and conditions. defendant would be required to pay victim restitution in an amount to be determined. on september 13, 2018, defendant withdrew his admission to the great-bodily-injury allegation. the court dismissed the allegation, suspended imposition of sentence, and granted defendant three yeaprobation, defendant was ordered to complete 26 anger management classes.3 he was also ordered to pay a $300 restitution fine ( 1202.4, subd. (b)), a $40 operations assessment ( 1465.8, subd. (a)(1)), and a $30 conviction assessment (gov. code,  70373). the court held a contested victim restitution hearing on october 24, 2018. after reviewing documents provided by son,4 3 the minute order erroneously states that defendant was required to take 52 anger management classes. in section 3 of the discussion, we order the court to correct the minute order. 4 on september 6, 2019, we notified the parties that we intended to take judicial notice of the documents considered at the restitution 4 the court ordered defendant to pay $66,247.85 in victim restitution. defendant filed a timely notice of appeal from the restitution order. discussion defendant argues the court should have limited victim -of-pocket costs and asks us to stay the restitution fine and strike the fees under people v. dueas (2019) 30 cal.app.5th 1157. 1. the victim restitution award was proper. defendant contends the court abused its discretion by ordering defendant to pay restitution to son for medical expenses 1.1. legal principles and standard of review people v. giordano (2007) 42 cal.4th 644, 655; cal. const., art. i,  28, subd.

(evid. code,  459, subd. (c).) as we have not received a response, we now take judicial notice of those documents. (evid. code,  452, subd. (d), 459, subd.

[people have] made a prima facie showing of his or her loss, the burden shifts to the defendant to demonstrate that the amount of millard, supra, 175 cal.app.4th at p. 26, alteration in millard.) we review victim restitution orders for abuse of discretion, mindful that an order resting on a demonstrable legal error constitutes such an abuse. (people v. hume (2011) 196 cal.app.4th 990, 995.) 1.2. not offset restitution owed to the victim. -of-pocket medical costs insurance company. including the expenses paid by anthem, defendant argues, gives millard, supra, 175 cal.app.4th at p. 27.) defendant does not acknowledge that the law on this matter is clear; nor does he argue that any of the cases the people cite on the point were wrongly decided. extent possible, the restitution order amount that is sufficient to fully reimburse the victim determined economic loss incurred as the result of the means to reimburse him or her for all out-of-pocket expenses 6 actually paid by the victim or others millard, supra, 175 cal.app.4th at p. 27.) expenses generally does not support inclusion of amounts of medical bills in excess of those amounts accepted by medical millard, supra, 175 cal.app.4th at p. 27.) here, however, the court awarded restitution based on -of-pocket costs and the expenses paid insurer, not the totals billed by the medical providers. the court ordered defendant to pay $66,247.85 in restitution to son, of which $1,494.40 was for lost profits and the court arrived at the medical expense total by adding the coinsurance payments. the court added $1,200 to compensate son for the uncovered medical services from his november 27, 2017 claim, but did not award son the $8,759.75 in uncovered services from his november 9, 2017 claim. looked at another -of-pocket medical expenses and about 85 percent of the payments made by anthem. this was not an abuse of discretion.5 5 we also note that the court ordered son to disgorge to anthem any payments that exceeded his out-of-pocket costs. neither party argues this order was improper. 7 2. before us. defendant also argues the court erred when it imposed court fees and a restitution fine without first considering his ability to pay under people v. dueas, supra, 30 cal.app.5th 1157. that issue is not properly before us. on september 13, 2018, the court suspended imposition of hearing, defendant was ordered to pay a $300 restitution fine ( 1202.4, subd. (b)), a $40 operations assessment ( 1465.8, subd. (a)(1)), and a $30 conviction assessment (gov. code,  70373). the court also ordered him to pay victim restitution in an amount to be determined at a later hearing. the restitution hearing was held on october 24, 2018, and defendant was ordered to pay $66,247.85. on october 25, 2018, defendant filed a document entitled, appeal states: defendant, harold gutierrez, hereby appeals from the judgment rendered on october 24, 2014 in department w82 of the los angeles county superior centry of [a] plea of no contest. this appeal raises only matters occurring after the entry of the plea which do not challenge the validity of the plea, to wit: the order of restitution made by the court on october 24, 2018. defendant is indigent and requests the appointment of counsel on appeal. 8 (italics added.) (see people v. arriaga (2014) 58 cal.4th 950, 960 [certificate of probable cause not required when defendant appeals from .) appeal is from the october 24, 2018 restitution order. it does not although defendant could have appealed from the earlier order, he chose not to. certainly, notices of appeal in criminal cases must be construed liberally. (cal. rules of court, rule 8.304(a)(4).) but here, in twice referencing the october 24, 2018 restitution order, defendant explicitly excluded the earlier september order. (ibid. the particular judgment or order being appealedthe fine and fees imposed on september 13, 2018, or his contention that imposition of the fine and fees violated his plea agreement. limited financial resources, the court below ordered the fine and fees stayed until defendant finished paying victim restitution. 3. the court is directed to correct the minute order of september 13, 2018. to the extent a minute order diverges from the proceedings it purports to memorialize, it is presumed to be the product of clerical error. (people v. mesa (1975) 14 cal.3d 466, 471.) ourts may correct clerical errors at any time, and appellate courts (including this one) that have properly assumed jurisdiction of (people v. mitchell (2001) 26 cal.4th 181, 185), may order 9 correction of a minute order that does not accurately reflect the oral pronouncement of sentence (id. at pp. 185188). as discussed, under the plea agreement, defendant was required to complete 26 anger management classesand the ordered him to complete 26 anger management classes. the minute order of september 13, 2018, however, indicates defendant is required to take 52 anger management classestwice as many. the minute order is wrong and must be corrected. (see people v. mitchell, supra, 26 cal.4th at pp. 185188 [discussing the importance of correcting inaccurate abstracts of judgment on appeal].) 10 disposition the victim restitution order is affirmed. upon issuance of the remittitur, the trial court is directed to correct the minute order of september 13, 2018, to reflect that defendant was required to complete only 26 anger management classes, and to send a certified copy of the corrected minute order to the los angeles county probation department. not to be published in the official reports lavin, j. we concur: edmon, p. j. egerton, j.
