(jennings v. marralle (1994) 8 cal.4th 121, 126; olson v. cory (1983) 35 cal.3d 390, 398.) hence, we issued an order to show cause and calendared the matter of argument which was waived. the denial of a motion to vacate the judgment is, under our circumstances, nonappealable. (people v. banks (1959) 53 cal.2d 370, 378; people v. gallardo (2000) 77 cal.app.4th 971, 980.) in many respects, defendants paperwork bears a remarkable resemblance to a habeas corpus petition. the denial of a habeas corpus petition is not appealable. (in re clark (1993) 5 cal.4th 750, 767, fn. 7; in re hochberg (1970) 2 cal.3d 870, 876, disapproved on other grounds in in re fields (1990) 51 cal.3d 1063, 1070, fn. 3.) thus, the order under review is not appealable. the appeal is dismissed. not to be published in the official reports turner, p. j. we concur: mosk, j. kriegler, j.
