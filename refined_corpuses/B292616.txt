filed 8/8/19 p. v. bustos ca2/2 not to be published in the official reports california rules of court, rule 8.1115(a), prohibits courts and parties from citing or relying on opinions not certified for publication or ordered published, except as specified by rule 8.1115(b). this opinion has not been certified for publication or ordered published for purposes of rule 8.1115. in the court of appeal of the state of california second appellate district division two the people, plaintiff and respondent, v. lorraine cathleen bustos, defendant and appellant. b292616 (los angeles county super. ct. no. na108500) appeal from a judgment of the superior court of los angeles county. richard m. goul, judge. affirmed in part. reversed and remanded in part with directions. byron c. lichstein, under appointment by the court of appeal, for defendant and appellant. xavier becerra, attorney general, gerald a. engler, chief assistant attorney general, lance e. winters, senior assistant attorney general, david e. madeo, noah p. hill and rene 2 judkiewicz, deputy attorneys general, for plaintiff and respondent. * * * * * * a jury convicted lorraine cathleen bustos (defendant) of prior (pen. code,  666.5),1 and (2) bringing contraband into a jail instructions for each crime were incorrect, that the court erred in s verdict after one juror during polling indicated failed to make necessary findings during sentencing. defendant is right that the trial court gave incorrect jury instructions for each crime; the instructional error on the contraband count was harmless, but the error on the taking/driving count was not. accordingly, we affirm the contraband conviction but vacate the taking/driving a car conviction with instructions for the people to decide whether to retry that count or reduce it to a misdemeanor. facts and procedural background i. facts in february 2018, defendant was pulled over while driving a 2000 honda civic. the car had been stolen from its owner many months before, in the summer of 2017. the carplate had been swapped out with plates from a different honda civic. defendant was driving the car using a key made for a general motors car, but which worked in the civic because the tumblers in its ely worn down. 1 all further statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise indicated. 3 following her arrest for driving a stolen vehicle, defendant was driven to jail. upon arrival, the arresting officer asked defendant if she had any illegal narcotics or weapons on her; she gns prohibiting persons from bringing narcotics into the jail. a female jailer found two small baggies containing methamphetamine in during a pat down search, although defendant may have told the jailer about those baggies prior to the pat down. the jailer then conducted a strip search, and found a third baggie containing heroin in a baggie wrapped in toilet paper defendant never mentioned that baggie. the drugs were in a useable amount. ii. procedural background a. charges contraband into the jail ( 4573, subd. (a)). the people alleged a vehicle conviction as 1) as a slaw ( 667, subds. (b)-(j), 1170.12, subds. (a)-(d)). b. jury instructions as to the taking/driving a vehicle count, the trial court instructed the jury that defendant could be found guilty if she possession or ownership of the vehicle as to the bringing count, the court instructed the jury that 4 the court did not instruct the because defendant had admitted that allegation prior to trial. c. argument in her opening statement, the prosecutor argued that in her closing argument, the prosecutor re- in so arguing, the prosecutor . in rebuttal, however, license plate on the car. and obviously, people who steal cars, they have to find a way to be able to d. verdicts the jury returned guilty verdicts as to the crimes of contraband into the jail. e. post-trial admission and sentencing after defendant admitted her prior strike conviction, the trial court sentenced defendant to eight years in jail. the court imposed a six-year sentence on the taking/driving with a prior count, comprised of a mid-term, three-year base term, doubled due to the prior strike. the court then imposed a consecutive two-year sentence on the contraband count, compromised of a base term of one year (one-third of the mid-term, three year sentence), doubled due to the prior strike. the court did not specifically state why it ran the two counts consecutively, although it more generally set forth several aggravating factors 5 for misdemeanors), the fact she was on probation for robbery ] impact[]her crime had on the victim who lost his transportation, and the e. appeal defendant filed this timely appeal. discussion i. instructional errors we independently review claims of instructional error. (people v. guiuan (1998) 18 cal.4th 558, 569-570.) a. taking/driving instruction incorrect. vehicle code section 10851 (or section 666.5, when the felony version of this crime is committed repeatedly) sets forth two distinct crimesnamely, (1) the crime of taking a vehicle driving a people v. garza (2005) 35 calfelony only if the value of the vehicle exceeds $950. (people v. page (2017) 3 cal.5th 1175, 1182-1183 (page); see  490.2, subd. (a).) the ot require any showing of value. (people v. lara (2019) 6 cal.5th 1128, 1136-1137 (lara).) the jury instruction in this case set forth requirement. as to the taking crime, this was error. (page, at pp. 1182-1183.) the instruction therefore presented the jury with one legally invalid theory (that is, the taking charge without the value element) and one legally valid theory (that is, the driving 6 charge). (people v. gutierrez (2018) 20 cal.app.5th 847, 857 (gutierrez).) this type of error mandates reversal unless we can sonable doubt that the jury based its people v. chiu (2014) 59 cal.4th 155, 167 (chiu); people v. chun (2009) 45 cal.4th 1172, 1205.) we can reach this conclusion only when the conduct of the trialincluding the jury instructions, the verdict forms, and evidence presentedin re martinez (2017) 3 cal.5th 1216, 1226.) although we think it very rested on the legally valid driving theory, the trial record does not compel this conclusion. to be sure, the evidence focused on g the civic in february 2018 several months after its theft and the prosecutor argued in her opening statement and initial closing argument that she was relying constitutes evidence of a prior taking, as the prosecutor seemed to suggest in her rebuttal argument when she argued that non-standard keys. further, the court instructed the jury on both the driving and the taking occurs) and the verdict form invited the jury to convict on both theories. for these reasons, we cannot conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that all 12 jurors actually based their verdict on the legally valid driving theory. (accord, gutierrez, supra, 20 cal.app.5th at pp. 851-857 [reversing conviction when jury instructions and verdict form presented both vehicle code section 10851 theories]; cf. lara, supra, 6 cal.5th at pp. 1136-1138 7 [upholding conviction when jury instructions and verdict form were limited to driving theory]; see generally people v. melhado theory].) section 66remand the matter to allow the people either to accept [a] reduction of the conviction to a misdemeanor [conviction for taking a vehicle worth $950 or less under vehicle code section 10851] or to retry the offense as a felony with appropriate instructiongutierrez, supra, 20 cal.app.5th at p. 857; see chiu, supra, 59 cal.4th at p. 168; see generally people v. navarro (2007) 40 cal.4th 668, 678 [under  1260, appellate court may modify a verdict to reflect a conviction of a lesser included offense where insufficient evidence supports the conviction on the greater given this disposition, we have no occasion to address further arguments that (1) upholding the section 666.5 conviction on a driving theory is invalid absent a finding that the car was worth more than $950,2 and (2) the trial court erred in not spelling out its reasons for running the section 666.5 and contraband sentences consecutively. b. contraband instruction the trial instruction on the contraband count was also legally incorrect. among other things, section 4573 makes it a crime to bring controlled into a 2 we note that lara seems to reject this argument as a textual matter (lara, supra, 6 cal.5th at pp. 1136-1137), but that our supreme court has yet to address whether its textual construction is absurd or violates equal protection, which is the issue presented in people v. bullard, no. s239488. 8 city and county, or city jai ( 4573, subd. (a), italics added.) the jury instruction, however, required the jury to find that defendant knowingly possessed a controlled in the jail. as a result, the instruction given to the jury omitted the element of it is well settled, however, that a failure to instruct the jury on an element of the crime is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt if the omitted element is and supported by (people v. merritt (2017) 2 cal.5th 819, 821-822, 830-832; neder v. united states (1999) 527 u.s. 1, 17-18.) here, the evidence that defendant knowingly brought into the jail the heroin secreted in her buttocks was overwhelming: she at most disclosed methamphetamine in her bra and said nothing about the heroin in her buttocks. a defendant is guilty of bringing drugs into a jail if she is arrested and are secreted on [her] (people v. low (2010) 49 cal.4th 372, 383.) the element was also uncontested: defendant argued that she was given no opportunity to tell the officer or jailer about the drugs on her person, but this argument is irreconcilable with the evidence at trial and does not in any event contest the fact that defendant entered the jail with heroin secreted on her person. ii. jury polling a. pertinent facts after the jury returned its verdicts, the trial court polled the jury. during the polling, the court had the following exchange with juror no. 5: court: juror 5, are these your verdicts? or no. 5]: well, actually we had deliberations. i first voted not guilty but - - 9 court: do you need to go back and deliberate more? no. 5]: no. no. court: okay. i need to know right now. the verdicts we just read were guilty to both counts as charged. are those your verdicts? no. 5]: i guess, yeah. court: pardon me? no. 5]: yes. court: thank you. b. analysis a jury verdict in a criminal case is valid only if all 12 jurors unanimously but independently conclude that the defendant is guilty. (cal. const., art. i,  16; people v. bailey (2018) 27 cal.app.5th 376, 382.) to ensure that the written verdict form the (people v. thorton (1984) 155 cal.app.3d 845, 859), a criminal defendant may ask the court to poll the jurors by [them] whether [the written verdict] is their ( 1163). any one [juror] answer[s] in the the court must send the jury back for further deliberations and, when so doing, may not instruct the dissenting juror(s) to reconsider their views in light of the vote. ( 1163; people v. gainer (1977) 19 cal.3d 835, 848-851, overruled on a different point in people v. valdez (2012) 55 cal.4th 82, 163.) however, ot every expression of uncertainty during polling requires that recordation of the verdict be withheld while the jury is sent back for further (chipman v. superior court (1982) 131 cal.app.3d 263, 267.) instead, the court must the state of vis--vis the verdict by looking to the statements and demeanor. 10 (people v. superior court (1967) 67 cal.2d 929, 933.) we review such a determination for an abuse of discretion. (ibid.) in this case, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that juror no. 5 abandoned his or her initial equivocation and ultimately affirmed the verdict. where, as here, juror at first answers evasively or in the negative, if he [or she] finally acquiesces in the verdict, it must be (people v. burnett (1962) 204 cal.app.2d 453, 458.) that is because positive renders her remark unimportant. (ibid.) thus, juror no. initial revelation that he or she initially voted not guilty was eclipsed by his or her subsequent affirmation of the written verdict. and, contrary to what defendant urges, the fact that juror no. 5 initially held a different view does not by itself mean that the juror was coerced into changing his or her mind; jurors are allowedand, indeed, encouragedto change their minds after evaluating the evidence and deliberating with their fellow jurors. defendant argues that the trial court erred because it did not, upon hearing juror no. answers, repeat the jury instructions it had previously given regarding each duty to decide the case for himself or herself. we reject this argument for two reasons. first, defendant has forfeited this argument by not requesting re-instruction at that time. errors in polling procedures are forfeited if not raised at a time when the trial court can correct them. (people v. anzalone (2013) 56 cal.4th 545, 264-266; keener v. jeld-wen, inc. (2009) 46 cal.4th 247, 250.) second, the argument is without merit in any event. defendant insists that she is not saying that the court should have sent the jury back for further deliberation, but there would be no reason to remind juror no. 5 of her right to disagree if the 11 juror were not to then exercise that right during further deliberations. more to the point, it was the job to assess juror no. words and demeanor in evaluating whether he or she was disavowing or adopting the written verdict. the presence or absence of re-instruction does not undercut the reasonable determination that juror no. 5 was adopting the verdict, thereby obviating any need for further deliberation or instruction. 12 disposition the judgment is affirmed in part and reversed and remanded in part with directions. the conviction on count 2 (the contraband count) is affirmed. the conviction on count 1 (the section 666.5 count) is reversed. the matter is remanded to allow the people to elect whether to accept a conviction for a misdemeanor violation of vehicle code section 10851 or to retry the section 666.5 count. if people elect the former, the court may resentence defendant up to, but no greater than, the aggregated eight-year sentence previously imposed.
