(see pen. code,  293.5, subd. (a).) 3 grabbed her. knife. angel tried to fight off the intruder; she tried to scream the intruder pushed angel into the living room. he shoved a cloth into her mouth. angel mask over her eyes. he began to strangle her with his hands. angel recognized the outside the apartment building several days earlier. dress up. he fondled her breasts, rubbed her vagina, and told her began to gag when nguyen put her mouth on his penis. at some the kitchen area and gave her some water to drink. nguyen forced angel back to the sofa in the living room. he again told thought if trape [her], and [she wasd angel to perform oral sex a third time; she bit his hand, which tasted like rubber. neonto his penis. nguyen asked angel if he could use her bathroom to wash up. she said yes and she could hear him running water in the bathroom. nguyen told angel he would come back and kill her if she called the police. after nguyen left, angel threw her belongings back into her purse, grabbed a kitchen knife, and ran down the stairs and out the door to her car. she drove straight to the police station. police took angel to the hospital where a nurse collected swabs. 4 a comparison of and right hand with a reference sample taken from nguyen showed nguyen was a potential contributor.2 the people charged nguyen with assault to commit a felony during the commission of a first degree burglary in violation of penal code section 220, subdivision (b) (count 1)3; two counts of forcible oral copulation in violation of section 288a, subdivision (c)(2)(a) (counts 2 and 3); and first degree residential burglary in violation of section 459 (count 4). the people alleged nguyen used a deadly and dangerous weapona knifein the commission of the assault. on counts 2 and 3, the people alleged nguyen used a deadly weapon, tied or bound the victim, or committed the crimes during a burglary within the meaning of section 667.61, subdivisions (a), (b), (c)(7), (d)(4), and (e)(3), (5). nguyen testified on his own behalf at trial. nguyen said he 4 he stated he was asleep when angel was assaulted. the defense also called 2 the dna testing showed a third contributor, in addition to nguyen and angel, at one of 15 locations. 3 statutory references are to the penal code. 4 when asked on direct examination whether he ever had . b an investigator he was outside drinking and nguyen responded, -examination, nguyen admitted him if he ever had gone into the apartment. when the prosecutor asked nguyen whether he would know if he had gone into the ty straightforward answer. 5 nguyen played a video game that night sometime before 1:00 a.m. and nguyen then went outside to smoke. nguyen came back in, a long time in the restroom, like he always does,lay down on his bed and went to sleep before 2:00 a.m. vinny a defense dna expert, blaine kern, testified dna can be transferred by touch. in his closing argument, defense counsel suggested angelwhile running downstairs after the attackcould have touched something nguyen had touched. the jury convicted nguyen on all counts and found all of the special allegations true. the trial court sentenced nguyen to an indeterminate term of life in prison as well as a determinate term of six years. the court imposed consecutive 25 to life sentences on counts 2 and 3. the court found the two within the meaning of sections 667.6, subdivision (d), and 667.61, subdivision (i). on count 1, the court sentenced nguyen to seven years to life plus one year for the knife use, consecutive to counts 2 and 3, but stayed that sentence under section 654. on count 4, the court imposed the upper term of six years, consecutive to counts 2 and 3. the court gave nguyen presentence custody credits of 775 actual days but no good conduct credits. the court ordered nguyen to pay restitution to the victim compensation and government claims board in the amount of $2,000 plus interest under section 1202.4, subdivision (f). the board had provided angel with funds to relocate. the court also imposed a restitution fine of $300 under section 1202.4, subdivision (b), a court operations assessment of $160 ($40 per count), and 6 a criminal conviction assessment of $120 ($30 per count). the court imposed and stayed a $300 parole revocation fine.5 discussion 1. on count 4 nguyen contends the trial court should have stayed his sentence on count 1 as well as count 4. the attorney general we agree as well. on on count 4 under section 654. 2. of nguyen contends he was entitled to have the jury decide whether his two acts of forcible oral copulation took place subdivision (i). nguyen acknowledges the united states states from assigning to judges, rather than to juries, the finding of facts necessary to the imposition of consecutive, rather than concurrent, sentences for multiple offenses. (see oregon v. ice (2009) 555 u.s. 160, 168-172; see also people v. nguyen (2009) 46 cal.4th apprendi [v. new jersey (2000) 530 u.s. 466] does not require a jury determination of facts bearing on whether to impose concurrent 5 in addition, the court imposed a sex offender fine of $300 the minute order states the total sex offender fine with penalty assessments and the surcharge was $1,810. nguyen does not mention this fine in his appellate briefing. 7 or consecutive sentences for separate offenses.) nguyen argues the dissenting opinion in oregon v. ice with vitation. nguyen also notes he must raise his objection to the rule announced in oregon v. ice 3. nguyen is entitled to presentence good conduct credits of 15 percent nguyen asserts he is entitled to presentence good time/work time credits of 15 percent under section 2933.1. the attorney general agrees, citing people v. andrade (2015) 238 cal.app.4th 1274, 1311. we accept the concession.6 6 a leading treatise ] . . . 667.61 (one strike law) . . .

( 2933.2.) 8 4. nguyen is not entitled to an ability to pay hearing in a supplemental brief nguyen contends he is entitled to a remand to the trial court for a hearing on his ability to pay the restitution fine and court assessments under people v. dueas (2019) 30 cal.app.5th 1157 (dueas). nguyen states he contest the direct victim restitution order of some courtsincluding our colleagues in division twohave held dueas was wrongly decided. (people v. hicks (sept. 24, 2019, b291307) ___ cal.app.5th ___ [2019 wl 4635156]; see also people v. aviles (2019) 39 cal.app.5th 1055; cf. people v. caceres (2019) 39 cal.app.5th 917, 923, 927 [dueas; concluding in any event dueas does not justify extending its holding be in any event, unlike the defendant in dueas, nguyen did not object to the imposition of the restitution fine or assessments or assert any inability to pay. generally, where a defendant has failed to object to a restitution fine based on an inability to pay, he has forfeited the issue on appeal. (people v. avila (2009) 46 cal.4th 680, 729.) we agree with our colleagues in division eight that this general rule applies here as well to the assessments imposed under section 1465.8 and government code section 70373. (people v. bipialaka (2019) 34 cal.app.5th 455, 464; people v. frandsen (2019) 33 cal.app.5th 1126, 1153-1155; but see people v. jones (2019) 36 cal.app.5th 1028; people v. castellano (2019) 33 cal.app.5th 485.) of the people of the state of california that all persons who suffer losses as a result of criminal activity shall have the right to seek and secure restitution from the persons convicted of the crimes , 9 par. (13)(a).) our legislature enacted section 1202.4 to promote and further this intent. the california victim compensation and government claims board provides restitution to crime victims from the restitution fund. (see gov. code,  13950-13966.) work. the board provided the victim here, angel doe, with $2,000 for relocation expenses. not only had angel been repeatedly violated in her apartment, continued to live downstairs. in her victim impact statement, [n]o matter pills popped, knowledge of self-defense, weapons, security systems, tears shed, or had when coming home taken [away] even if forfeiture did not apply to the restitution fine and assessments, dueas does not apply here. dueas is based on the due process implications of imposing a fine and assessments on an impoverished defendant. the situation in which nguyen has put himselflife in prison for at least 50 yearsdoes not implicate the same due process concerns. nguyen, unlike dueas, does not face incarceration because of an inability to pay a restitution fine and assessments. nguyen is in prison because he hid in forced her orally to copulate him. even if nguyen does not pay the fine and assessments, he will suffer none of the cascading and potentially devastating consequences dueas suffered. (dueas, supra, 30 cal.app.5th at p. 1163.) nguyen has not faced and never will face additional punishment because he cannot pay the restitution fine or assessments. finally, nguyen has presented no evidence of any inability to pay. when he committed his crimes, nguyen was employed 10 as a chef at a sheraton hotel. he had an iphone 5. he had been show [nguyen] had some past income-earning capacity, but going forward we know he will have the ability to earn prison people v. johnson (2019) 35 cal.app.5th 134, 139to pay [$580] while serving a [50]-year prison sentence is unsustainabibid[nguyen] is correct that he suffered a due process violation when the court imposed this rather modest financial burden on him without taking his ability to pay into account, we conclude that, on this record, because he has ample time to pay it from a readily available source of income while incarcerated, the error id. at pp. 139-140, citing chapman v. california (1967) 386 u.s. 18, 24.) 11 disposition -year sentence on count 4 under penal code section 654 and to award him 116 days of presentence conduct credits. the court is to prepare an amended abstract of judgment and forward it to the california department of corrections and rehabilitation. not to be published in the official reports egerton, j. i concur: dhanidina, j. lavin, acting p.j., concurring: not entitled to a jury determination of whether his crimes took place on separate occasions. i also agree that count 4 must be stayed and that defendant is entitled to 15 percent custody credit. defendant forfeited any challenge to the imposition of the court facilities fee (gov. code,  70373), the court security fee (pen. code,1  1465.8), and the restitution fine ( 1202.4, subd. (b)) by failing to object in the trial court. people v. dueas, which held that mandatory fines and fees could not constitutionally be imposed on criminal defendants unable to pay them, represented a sea change in the law of fines and fees in california. (people v. dueas (2019) 30 cal.app.5th 1157, 11691172.) no one saw it comingand defendant was not required to anticipate it. (people v. johnson (2019) 35 cal.app.5th 134, 137138; see people v. brooks (2017) 3 cal.5th traditionally excused parties for failing to raise an issue at trial where an objection would have been futile or wholly unsupported i conclude no error occurred because the court impliedly found defendant had the ability to pay the disputed fine and fees. i therefore concur. when a defendant is convicted of a sex crime listed in section 290, subdivision (c), the court must impose a fine under 1 all undesignated statutory references are to the penal code. 2 290.3, subd. (a).)2 the fine is $300 for the first offense and $500 for each subsequent offense (ibid.) plus penalty assessments and the state surcharge (people v. valenzuela (2009) 172 cal.app.4th 1246, 1249). the fine applies per count rather than per case. ( (2004) 122 cal.app.4th 817, 822.) thus, as defendant was convicted of two eligible sex offenses, the court was required to impose one $300 fine and one $500 fine plus penalty assessments and the surcharge. instead, the court imposed a single $300 sex offender fine under section 290.3 plus $870 in penalty assessments and a $60 state surcharge. on a silent record, the failure to impose all required sex offender fines implies a finding that the defendant lacks the ability to pay the fines the court did not impose. (people v. stewart (2004) 117 cal.app.4th 907, 911.) that is, by ordering defendant to pay $300 rather than $800, the court impliedly found that defendant could pay $300 in fines but could not pay more than that. light of his total financial obligations. (people v. valenzuela (2009) 172 cal.app.4th 1246, 1249.) total financial obligations include the conviction assessment (gov. code,  70373), the operations assessment ( 1465.8), the restitution fine ( 1202.4), 2 although the parties did not address section 290.3 in their briefing, the contention that he lacked the ability to pay the disputed fine and fees. (see people v. alice (2007) 41 cal.4th 668, 679 the parties need only have been given an opportunity to brief the issue decided by the court, and the fact that a party does not address an issue, mode of analysis, or authority that is raised or fairly included within the issues raised does not implicate the protections of [government code] section 68081. 3 and victim restitution. (people v. castellanos (2009) 175 cal.app.4th 1524, 15311532.) i presume the court accounted for these obligations when it concluded defendant could pay the $300 sex offender fine and $930 in penalty assessments and the state surcharge but could not pay the other required sex offender fine. (ibid.) and, because the court concluded defendant had the ability to pay $1,230 more than the fine and fees he now challenges, it follows that the court found he had the ability to pay the challenged fine and fees as well. as the court below has already made an ability to pay determination, there is no need to remand for the hearing defendant requests. lavin, acting p.j.
