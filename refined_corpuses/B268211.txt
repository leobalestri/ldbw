(a)) and to having served a prior prison term ( 667.5, subd. (b)). he was sentenced to state prison for a total term of two years and four months, consisting of a sentence of one year and four months for his conviction and the one-year prior prison term enhancement. proposition 47. the prosecutor opposed the petition, contending he was ineligible for relief, because the value of the property exceeded $950. receiving stolen property conviction to a misdemeanor pursuant to proposition 47. this application was signed by defendant on august 11, 2015. 47 relief. the prosecution reiterated its objection that the value of the property exceeded $950. neither defendant nor his counsel was present. at the conclusion of the hearing, stolen property involved property whose value exceeded $950. discussion pursuant to proposition 47, the offense of receiving stolen property is a misdemeanor if the value of the automobile did not exceed $950. ( 496, subd. (a).) defendant contends the trial court erred in inferring the value of the property was over $950, because such inference was based improperly on extrinsic evidence outside the record of conviction. the threshold issue, however, is whether defendant met his initial burden to establish his eligibility for relief under proposition 47. he has not. a defendant is required to present in the petition itself evidence that the value of the automobile does not 4 exceed $950. a mere allegation or assertion that the value was $950 or less is insufficient to satisfy this burden to make a prima facie showing through evidence of the value of the automobile. (people v. perkins (2016) 244 cal.app.4th 129, 137, (perkins); people v. rivas-colon (2015) 241 cal.app.4th 444, 448-450 (rivas-colon); people v. sherow (2015) 239 cal.app.4th 875, 877, 880 (sherow).) in this instance, defendant did not even check the box on his application indicating the value of the property did not exceed $950. showing through evidence in his written application that the value of the stolen property he received was $950 or less therefore renders inconsequential his claims of error on this petition, because defendant failed to meet this threshold burden.3 the trial courts reasoning and, if the ruling was correpeople v. zamudio (2008) 43 cal.4th 327, 351, fn. 11; see also rivas-colon, supra, 241 cal.app.4th 444, 450, fn. 3; perkins, supra, 224 cal.app.4th 129, 139.) disposition the order appealed from is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. boren, p.j. we concur: ashmann-gerst, j. chavez, j. 3 in sherow, the court indicated a defendant may file a new request for proposition 47 relief with evidence of eligibility.
