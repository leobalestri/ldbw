[citations.] if no ambiguity appears in the statutory language, we presume that the legislature meant what it said, and the plain meaning of the people v. stanley (2012) 54 cal.4th 734, 737.) ii. application of relevant principles article i, section 28, subdivision (b) of the california constitution provides in part: tion of the people of the state of california that all persons who suffer losses as a result of criminal activity shall have the right to seek and secure restitution from the persons convicted of the crimes causing the losses they suffer. [] restitution shall be ordered 5 from the convicted wrongdoer in every case, regardless of the sentence or disposition imposed, in which a crime victim suffers a the legislature implemented the constitutional right to restitution in section 1202.4. (rubics, supra, 136 cal.app.4th at p. 457; people v. lai (2008) 138 cal.app.4th 1227, 1247.) a and liberally construed. (people v. beaver (2010) 186 cal.app.4th 107, 127; people v. saint-amans (2005) 131 cal.app.4th 1076, 1084.) of the legislature that a victim of crime who incurs any economic loss as a result of the commission of a crime shall receive restitution directly from any defend(a)(1) is the loss resulting from the crime of which the defendant people v. lai, supra, 138 cal.app.4th at p. 1247.) vehicle code section driver of a vehicle involved in an accident resulting in injury to a person, other than himself or herself, or in the death of a person shall immediately stop the vehicle at the scene of the accident and shall fulfill 5 calcrim no. 2140 sets forth the elements of a violation of vehicle code section 20001 in part as follows: 5 vehicle code sections 20003 and 20004 require a driver involved in an accident resulting in injury or death to provide identifying information and to render reasonable assistance to persons injured in the accident. 6 people must prove that: , the defendant was involved in a vehicle accident; serious] injury to) someone else; an accident that injured another person [or knew from the nature of the accident that it was probable that another person had been injured]; rubics addressed the scope of restitution in a hit and run case. rubics pleaded guilty to one count of violating vehicle code section 20001, subdivision (a). (rubics, supra, 136 cal.app.4th at p. 454.) he also admitted the allegation that the accident resulted in death. (veh. code,  20001, subd. (b)(2).) (rubics, supra, 136 cal.app.4th at p. 454.) the trial court sentenced rubics to a term of three years in state prison and ordered him to pay $44,expenses. (ibid.) on appeal, rubics argued the trial court erred in ordering restitution because the economic loss sufferedi.e., the funeral expensesresulted from the accident, and not from his criminal conduct in leaving the scene of the accident. (rubics, supra, 136 cal.app.4th at p. 456.) in support of his argument, rubics cited people v. escobar (1991) 235 cal.app.3d 1504 and people v. wood (2000) 83 cal.app.4th 862 for the proposition that 7 offense . . . is not the initial injury of the victim, but leaving the s(rubics, supra, 136 cal.app.4th at pp. 458-459.) the court of appeal rejected rubicsreasoning, however, rubics reads section 20001, for restitution purposes, too narrowly. . . . [a] necessary element of section 20001 is that rubics was involved in an accident that caused serious injury or death. thus, although a primary focus of section 20001 may be the act of leaving the scene, a conviction also acknowledges the fleeing drivers responsibility for the damages he or she has (rubics, supra, 136 cal.app.4th at p. 459.) accordingly, the court of appeal ruled that because an element of the crime of felony hit and run under section 20001, subdivisions (a) and (b)(2) is a defendants involvement in an accident resulting in the injury or death of another, restitution is proper in such a situation because the loss was incurred as a result of id. at p. 454.) we agree with rubics. because an accident resulting in injury or death is an integral element of the hit and run offense and thus , the trial court erred in ruling that any loss resulting from the collision restitution award under section 1202.4. (rubics, supra, 136 cal.app.4th at pp. 454, 458-459.) defendant argues that even if we determinethe trial court erred in denying restitution for loss resulting from the accident, we should not remand for a hearing to determine her responsibility for that loss because the people could have 8 presented evidence of her responsibility in the trial court, but did not. in from the accident was not subject to a restitution award under culpability is appropriate. disposition the portion of the restitution order that denied restitution for loss resulting from the accident in which struck pregerson is reversed. the matter is remanded to the trial court if any, for the accident and to order defendant to pay restitution for damages attributable to her. not to be published in the official reports. kumar, j. we concur: turner, p. j. kriegler, j. judge of the superior court of the county of los angeles, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
