(evid. code,  452, subd. (d)(1).) 3 he intended to cause great bodily injury to another person. the opposition also stated that arly demonstrates his danger to defendant.3 prior to the hearing on the petition, the people provided the court with a as an exhibit for the hearing. at the hearing, the defense argued that defendant was too intoxicated to form the intent to cause great bodily injury, and the people responded that it could be inferred ntoxication did not reach that level. the prosecutor pointed out that defendant, after inflicting the blows on the victim, took her purse and threw her identification cards and other cards all over the floor so that the victim could not find what she needed to be admitted to the hospital. the court pointed followed the victim from the apartment to the phone booth, where she attempted to call her sister, and he hung up the telephone when she first tried to use it. also, the police report did not mention that defendant was intoxicated. the prosecutor argued that defendant intended to hurt the victim because he was angry about her being on the phone with a male friend and because she laughed at him. the defense posited that defendant was intoxicated and was reacting to the with the intention of causing the victim great bodily injury but rather were part of a drunken altercation, and there was no indication the acts would have occurred had defendant been sober. 3 on march 3, 2014, defendant filed a preliminary reply to the opposition and requested a status conference. this reply contained the police report among the exhibits. the people filed a revised opposition to the petition on march 27, 2014, stating that defendant was ineligible and unsuitable for resentencing because he intended to cause great bodily injury, and he posed an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. defendant submitted a reply, which included as epreliminary hearing. the people submitted a response with many references to the and then a supplemental reply. 4 on october 28, 2014, the trial court issued its memorandum of decision. the intended to cause great bodily harm within the meaning of sections 1170.126, subdivision (e)(2) and 667, subdivision (e)(2)(c)(iii),4 citing people v. guilford (2014) 228 cal.app.4th 651, 662 (guilford). the court found the people had amply met their burden of showing by a preponderance of evidence that defendant was ineligible for resentencing because he intended to cause great bodily injury during the commission of the offense. discussion defendant contends that under the principles established in people v. guerrero (1988) 44 cal.3d 343 (guerrero), a trial court cannot consider disputed evidence in a at was not encompassed within the elements of the crime charged. defendant maintains that the st be reversed. ii. relevant authority in november 2012, california voters passed proposition 36, the three strikes reform act of 2012 (the act). the act amended sections 667 and 1170.12 and added section 1170.126, which provides for the resentencing of defendants previously sentenced under the three strikes lreserving indeterminate life sentences for cases where the new offense is also a serious or violent felony, unless the prosecution pleads and proves an enumerated disqualifying factor. in all other cases, a recidivist defendant will be sentenced as a second strike offender, rather than a third strike offender. people v. chubbuck (2014) 231 cal.app.4th 737, 740-741.) 4 section 667, subdivision (e)(2)(c)(iii) contains the identical language as the initiative version in section 1170.12, subdivision (c)(2)(c)(iii). 5 section 1170.126 allows defendants serving a life term for a third strike to petition for resentencing. ( 1170.126, subd. (b).) eligibility for resentencing is initially limited to defendants serving life terms for felonies that are neither serious nor violent. ( 1170.126, subd. (e)(1).) other factors can render a defendant ineligible for resentencing. one of the disqualifying factors cross-referenced in section 1170.126, e commission of the current offense, the defendant used a firearm, was armed with a firearm or deadly weapon, or intended to cause great b ( 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(c)(iii).) the court may also deny resentencing as a second strike offender if it finds the resentencing would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. ( 1170.126, subd. (f).) if the underlying conviction does not involve a sustained allegation that the defendant has actually inflicted great bodily injury, the trial court determines from the entire record of the conviction whether the defendant intended to inflict great bodily injury. (guilford, supra, 228 cal.app.4th 651, 659-finding of intent under the deferential sufficiency of the evidence standard. (id. at p. 661.) iii. petition properly denied as defendant argues, several cases from the courts of appeal have invoked the rule of guerrero e exclusionary criteria of section 1170.12, subdivision (c)(2)(c). (see, e.g., people v. bradford (2014) 227 cal.app.4th 1322, 1338-1339 (bradford).) guerrero held that in determining the truth of a prior-conviction allegation, the trier of fact may look to the entire record of the conviction, but no further. (guerrero, supra, 44 cal.3d at pp. 345, 355.) when determining the substance of a prior foreign conviction, the court may look to the entire record of the conviction, but if the record does not disclose the facts of the crime actually committed, the court must presume that it was for the least offense punishable under the foreign statute. (id. at p. 352.) 6 in bradford, the court stated that the determination as to proof of a prior conviction as resentencing based on the record of conviction are similar in that they are both retrospective. (bradford, supra, 227 cal.app.4th at p. 1339.) hence, a trial court adjudicating a guerrero and its progeny and should consider the record of conviction to decide whether petitioner is eligible for (ibid.) bradford noted there was no statutory procedure permitting the trial court to consider new evidence outside of the record. (ibid.) furthermore, limiting consideration to the record of conviction promotes the efficient administration of justice and prevents relitigation of the circumstances of a crime committed in the past, which might give rise to other constitutional concerns. (ibid., citing guerrero, supra, 44 cal.3d at p. 355.) according to defendant, guilford, supra, 228 cal.app.4th 651, cited by the trial court in its decision, was wrongly decided to the extent it suggested that a proper guerrero inquiry allows new fact finding beyond the nature of the conviction, and it should not be followed. guilford is very similar to the instant case in that the defendant was convicted of spousal abuse, received a three strikes sentence, and was denied resentencing on the ground that he intended to cause great bodily injury. (id. at pp. 654-appeal to determine his intent, since there was no finding that was pleaded and proved id. at p. 655.) the guilford court stated that the act did not require pleading and proof of disqualifying factors. (id. at p. 657.) id. at p. 659.) the reviewing court stated that a trial court may look to the entire record of a prior conviction, which included the prior appellate opinion. (id. at p. 660.) the court noted that guilford made no claim that the opinion misstated the facts, and he did not file a petition for rehearing. (id. at pp. 660-661.) therefore, it could be assumed the facts as stated in the opinion were faithful to the appellate record. (id. at p. 661.) the guilford court summarized the injuries suffered by the victim and 7 cited trial testimony regarding a prior incident when defendant had struck the victim several times and concluded there was substantial evidence to support the denial of the petition. (id. at pp. 661-662.) here, the trial court named certain facts in support of its ruling that were admitted as evidence at his trial and uncontroverted, citing to the trial record: defendant punched the victim six times in the face with a closed fist; the victim suffered a laceration to her lip requiring five stitches; she suffered a broken tooth; she suffered an injury to her nose that bled profusely and left a scar; she had lacerations in her mouth requiring cosmetic surgery; and her nightdress was soaked in blood. these bare facts were undisputed at the underlying trial, and the jury was not asked to make a finding of intent. testimony, was not in accord with the holdings or reasoning of guerrero and bradford. trial transcript, a document that defendant concedes was properly considered by the trial -utside the record or disputed facts. it is well people v. thomas (2011) 52 cal.4th 336, 355; people v. smith (2005) 37 cal.4th 733, 741; people v. phillips (1989) the intent with which an act is done may be inferred from the circumstances attending the act, including the manner in which the act was done and the means used by the appellate courts. (see people v. chubbuck, supra, 231 cal.app.4th at pp. 745, and finding, the act does not require a jury finding to establish the exceptions to allowing resentencing of a prisoner, as is stated in many of these same cases. (see people v. brimmer (2014) 230 cal.app.4th 782, 805, and cases cited therein.) the statute provides 8 that the court must determine whether the exceptions in section 1170.12, subdivision (c)(2)(c)(iii) apply. we observe that defendant does not discuss how an intent to inflict bodily injury is to be decided by the trial court in a petition for resentencing when such an intent is not people v. osuna (2014) 225 cal.app.4th 1020, permitting imposition of an additional sentence for, the mere intent to cause great bodily id. at p. 1034.) this indicates the electorate intended the disqualifying factors to have a broad reach and not be tethered to a particular offense or ibid.) as stated in guilford, supra, 228 cal.app.4th at page although some persons may have had such disqualifying factors plead and proved in the current case, in most cases such factors would not have been adjudicated. to adopt defendants reasoning would be to undermine one purpose of the people, acting via their reserved initiative powers, viz., to preclude dangerous persons from the recall provision. on his intent, the defendant in guerrero had a similar argument, i.e., that the application of the guerrero rule was unfair because it allowed enhancements for prior convictions to to the defendant at the time of the prior proceedings. (guerrero, supra, 44 cal.3d at p. 355.) guerrero answer consequences of their actions, even though they had not or could not foresee those ibid.) in the trial court neither erred nor abused its discretion in ruling that defendant was not eligible for resentencing. 9 disposition 1170.126 is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. boren, p.j. we concur: chavez, j. hoffstadt, j.
