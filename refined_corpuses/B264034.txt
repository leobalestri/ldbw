(b)(2))1 and to consecutive terms of two years on two convictions for pandering a minor under the age of 16 years ( 266i, subd. (b)(2)). macauley appeals the upper term on his pimping conviction and a consecutive term on one of the pandering convictions. macauley argues relied on aggravating factors that were inherent in the commission of the offenses, and the court relied on the same aggravating factors in selecting the upper term on the pimping count that the court relied on in imposing the consecutive sentence on the ntence custody credits, direct the trial court to correct errors in the abstract of judgment, and otherwise affirm. factual and procedural background in august 2012, after hearing evidence that macauley found two 13-year-old girls, s.t. and a.h., who had run away from home and put them to work as prostitutes, a jury convicted macauley of two counts of pimping a minor under 16 years of age2 and two 1 statutory references are to the penal code. 2 a person is guilty who, knowing another person is a prostitute, lives or derives support or maintenance in whole or in part from the earnings or proceeds of the persons prostitution, or from money loaned or advanced to or charged against that person by any keeper or manager or inmate of a house or other place where prostitution is practiced or allowed, or who solicits or receives compensation for soliciting for the personunder 16 years of age, the offense is punishable by imprisonment in the state prison for 3 counts of pandering a minor under 16 years of age.3 one count of each offense related to each girl. in a prior appeal, we reversed the conviction for pimping s.t. for insufficient evidence, affirmed the remaining convictions, and remanded for resentencing. at the resentencing hearing, counsel for macauley, citing mitigating factors that macauley was in state prison for the first time and had performed well there, asked the court to impose the middle or lower term on the pimping conviction and a concurrent sentence on the conviction for pandering a.h. the court acknowledged these mitigating factors, but de-year-old girls, took them to different parts of pretty eahead and sentence the defendant to the high term in count 2 [pimping a.h.], which is eight years. and the court is doing that because of the vulnerability of the victims involved. not just one. there were two victims involved. the court is going to look at the sophistication of the crime. you had another prostitute with you that you also had since perhaps she was young, if memory serves me, and she acted as the lookout. you were in one car, she was across the street, and you monitored how well they were doing, flagging down people out on the street, and so they can go off with strangers. thirteen-year-old girls, with strangers, performing sex for money in your pockets. sophistication, definitely great. also you took one of them to go get clothes, high heels, the short shirts. hese girls in a vulnerable position, and we all know what happens with prostitutes. and they very well are in a position 3 person for the purpose of prostitudevice or scheme, causes, induces, persuades, or encourages another person to become a -(2).) if, as here, the pandering victim is a minor under the age of 16 years, 4 where they could easily be killed. these were minors, and you were definitely in the the court sentenced macauley to the upper term of eight years on the pimping conviction and two years (one-third the middle term) on each pandering conviction, both two-year sentences to run consecutively, for a total of 12 years. the court awarded macauley the same 488 days of presentence custody credit (244 actual days and 244 days of conduct credit) the court had awarded at the original sentencing hearing. macauley timely appealed. discussion macauley raises three challenges to his upper term sentence for pimping and his consecutive sentence for pandering a.h.4 first, he contends both sentences violated his sixth amendment right to a jury trial. second, he contends the trial court erred by relying on aggravating factors that were inherent in the commission of the offenses. third, he contends the trial court erred by relying on the same aggravating factors in imposing the upper term on the conviction for pimping that the court relied on in imposing the consecutive sentence for the pandering conviction.5 4 macauley does not challenge his consecutive sentence for pandering s.t. 5 macauley concedes he did not raise any of these objections at his resentencing hearing, and to avoid forfeiture of his arguments he contends, among other things, that his counsel rendered ineffective assistance in failing to object at that time. because we find the objections are meritless, macauley cannot show his counsel was ineffective in failing to make them.

(see people v. scott, supra, 9 cal.4th at p. 350, fn. 12; rule 4.425(b)(1).) as noted, however, the trial court needed only one aggravating factor to impose the upper term and one aggravating factor to impose a consecutive term.

(see people v. buckhalter term already in progress is modified as the result of an appellate sentence remand, the sentencing court must recalculate and credit against the modified sentence all actual time the defendant has already served, whether in jail or prison, and whether before or since he d the matter to the trial court to award the appropriate credits and to enter a new abstract of judgment reflecting that award. 14 we also agree with macauley that the abstract of judgment filed on june 5, 2014 incorrectly reflects a conviction on the pimping count as to s.t. (count 1), imposition of the upper term of eight years on that count, and a stayed sentence on the conviction for pimping a.h. (count 2). we direct the trial court to correct the abstract of judgment to eliminate the conviction on counterm sentence of eight years (not stayed) on count 2. (see people v. mitchell (2001) 26 cal.4th 181, 188; people v. vega discrepancy between the oral pronouncement of judgment and the minute order or the disposition the matter is remanded to the trial court with directions to award the appropriate custody credits and to prepare a new abstract of judgment. the new abstract of judgment should reflect that macauley was not convicted on count 1 and reflect the imposition of the upper term of eight years on count 2. the trial court is also directed to forward a certified copy of the new abstract of judgment to the department of corrections and rehabilitation. in all other respects, the judgment is affirmed. segal, j. we concur: perluss, p. j. zelon, j.
