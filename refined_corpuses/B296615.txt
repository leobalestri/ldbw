(s.b. 1393), which grants trial courts the discretion to impose or strike a five-year sentence enhancement for a prior serious or violent felony conviction. s counsel on appeal filed a wende brief (people v. wende (1979) 25 cal.3d 436 (wende)) requesting that we conduct an independent review of the record. we have reviewed the record and find the order is not appealable. the appeal is dismissed. background as noted in our prior opinion (people v. hampton (oct. 21, 2015, b259664) [nonpub. opn.]), on december 3, 2013, appellant was charged by information with robbery (pen. code,  211)1 and resisting, obstructing, or delaying a peace officer ( 148, subd. (a)(1)). the information alleged appellant had suffered three prior convictions for robbery ( 211) and one prior conviction for first degree burglary ( 459), charged as prior serious or violent felony convictions ( 1192.7, 667.5, subd. (c)), as strikes under the three strikes law ( 667, subds. (b)(i), 1170.12, subds. (a)(d)), and as prior serious felony convictions ( 667, subd.

(people v. garcia (2018) 28 cal.app.5th 961, 972973.) at that time, a 4 conviction had been final for three years. (see people v. vieira (2005) 35 cal.4th 264, 305306 [judgment becomes final when the time for petitioning for a writ of certiorari in the united states supreme court has passed]; see in re spencer (1965) 63 cal.2d 400, 405 [judgment deemed final at remedy to a defendant on direct review absent any new authority to resentence appellant under s.b. 1393, the trial court lacked jurisdiction to grant his request. (see people v. hernandez (2019) 34 cal.app.5th 323, 326327.) because the trial court lacked juhis motion could not have affected his substantial rights. (id. at p. 327; see  1237.) thus, the order denying the motion is not an appealable order, and the appeal must be dismissed.
