(a),2 count 2) and misdemeanor battery ( 242, count 3). the jury was instructed that the prosecutor had elected to proceed on co 4 appellant was acquitted on count 2 and convicted on count 3. the court suspended imposition of a sentence and placed appellant on probation for three years, with terms and conditions, including that he serve 120 days in county jail, that he have no contact with garibay and kemper, and that he submit his person and property, including electronic devices, to search and seizure. this appeal followed. discussion i appellant complains that his right to due process was testimony that appellant did not surrender, which appellant claims was misleading. in a related argument, he claims to have been prejudiced by the admission of that appellant was arrested at a motel four days after speaking with sergeant kohl. in her opening statement, the prosecutor told the jury sergeant kohl was expected to testify that he told appellant to turn himself in because there was a warrant for his arrest, and officer seibert was expected to testify that appellant was arrested at a motel seven or eight days later. during trial, the irrelevant. the prosecutor argued that the circumstances of the arrest were relevant because appellant was found in possession of the same minivan that he had driven during his encounter with garibay, and because appellant was hiding out at a motel when he knew there was a warrant for his arrest; she agreed not to 5 argue the latter point if the court thought the argument was tenuous. sergeant kohl then testified to his june 29, 2016 conversation with appellant, in which he told appellant about the warrant for his arrest and suggested that he turn himself in. according to sergeant kohl, before officer seibert was called, the court indicated its tentative was to allow him to testify about the arrest and to allow the parties in response, defense counsel argued that in the june 29, 2016 conversation with sergeant kohl, appellant had agreed to surrender the following week, but he was arrested before that time. defense counsel played the recorded conversation for the court, and then stated that in the conversation sergeant kohl had told appellant, if 3 on the conversation was that appellant did not agree to surrender the following week but continued to negotiate throughout. the prosecutor insisted that was necessary to authenticate photographs of minivan. she refused offer to stipulate the minivan belonged to appellant, but she agreed not to argue that appellant was hiding out at the motel at the time of his arrest. defense testimony was irrelevant and cumulative was overruled. s testimony was misleading because it insinuated that appellant was given a 3 the recorded conversation has not been included in the record on appeal. 6 -surrender, and was arrested when he failed to do -of-guilt llant - due process bars the prosecution from knowingly presenting false evidence and imposes a duty to correct the know, is false or misleading. [citation.]people v. morrison (2004) 34 cal.4th 698, 716.) nor may the prosecutor present false or misleading argument. (ibid.) the problem with argument is that the recorded conversation on which he relies is not in the record, the attorneys restatement of what sergeant kohl said made clear that appellant was told he could be arrested before the following week. a specific time to self-surrender is inaccurate. similarly, ashould have been excluded as more prejudicial than probative because identification was not an issue, and the fact that appellant was arrested at a motel created the impression that he was fleeing to avoid arrest. in assessing whether in a given case a particular piece of evidence is relevant and whether it is more prejudicial than probative. [citations.]people v. duff (2014) 58 cal.4th 527, 558.) as she had told the court, the prosecutor used officer seibert to authenticate photographs of the minivan taken at the motel and to connect the minivan to appellant who had the keys 7 to that vehicle at the time of the arrest. she mentioned that the minivan was photographed at a motel only once and then broadly appellant has not shown that the authentication of the photographs of the minivan was cumulative of other evidence, or that the photographs were irrelevant. nor has appellant shown that the single reference to the motel was unassumption that it was is based on a speculative inferencethat the reason appellant was in the motel area was because he was either fleeing or hiding. the prejudicial effect of that inference was alleviated by the prosecutor agreement not to argue the point to the jury. on this record, we find no evidentiary error or deprivation of due process. ii appellant argues the court erred in not instructing the jury sua sponte on the lesser included offense of simple assault ( as to whether the milk bottle hit her. a lesser included offense is necessarily included within a greater offense if the greater offense cannot be committed without also committing the lesser offense. (people v. reed (2006) 38 cal.4th 1224, 1227.) battery requires a touching of the victim, however slight the touching may be. (people v. dealba (2015) 242 cal.app.4th 1142, 11491150.) simple assault is a lesser people v. fuller (1975) 53 cal.app.3d 417, 421.) a trial court must instruct on a lesser included offense whenever evidence that the defendant is guilty only of the 8 substantia by the jury. [citation.] substantial evidence in this context is evidence from which reasonable jurors could conclude that the lesser offense, but not the greater, was committed. [citation.] when evaluating whether a lesser included offense instruction should have been given, we view the evidence in the manner most favorable to the defendant and apply an independent review standard. people v. mullendore (2014) 230 cal.app.4th 848, 856.) supporting such an instruction. (people v. breverman (1998) 19 cal.4th 142, 177; people v. marshall (1996) 13 cal.4th 799, 847.) at trial, garibay initially chocolate bottle at me. but ithankfully i was able to move and have hit me. it might have been the door. [] later in her testimony, she said the bottle r to clarify if she could recall being hit by the bottle, garibay addedsay it did. [] i know the door did hit me. i was hit by a bottle, but i am not sure whether it was that or the door. but i am almost most [sic] certain than not tha still later, the prosecutor asked garibay if she had to do anything to avoid being hit by the bottle, and she answered: i moved to the side. i saw it coming and i kind of added that appellant forcefully opened the minivseconds after he threw the bottle at her. the prosecutor then you and then you dodge, he, within five seconds, opens his door? . 9 . . [] do you have to do anything to avoid being asked how she after the 911 call was played for the jury, the prosecutor suggested she avoided being hit by the bottle by moving to the side. those statements supported an instruction to the jury on the lesser included offense of assault since a battery would not have been completed unless garibay was hit by the bottle. but even assuming that the failure to instruct the jury on ss error analysis under people v. watson (1956) 46 cal.2d 818, 837, and . . . evidence sufficient to warrant an instruction on a lesser included offense does not necessarily amount to evidence sufficient to create a reasonable probability of a different outcome had the instruction been given. [citations.]people v. banks (2014) 59 cal.4th 1113, 1161, overruled on another ground in people v. scott (2014) 61 cal.4th 363, 391, fn. 3; see also people v. breverman, supra, 19 cal.4th at p. 165.) eview under watson . . . focuses not on what a reasonable jury could do, but what such a jury is likely to have done in the absence of the error under consideration. in making that evaluation, an appellate court may consider, among other things, whether the evidence supporting the existing judgment is so relatively strong, and the 10 evidence supporting a different outcome is so comparatively weak, that there is no reasonable probability the error of which the defendant complains affected the result. (breverman, at p. 177.) substantial evidence that the bottle did not hit her. that, however, is not the standard under people v. watson, supra, 46 ser enough to affect the outcome had the instructions not been people v. breverman, supra, 19 cal.4th at p. 177.) the not remember exactly what had hit herwhether the bottle or the car door, but after hearing the recorded 911 call she confirmed it was the bottle. the video taken by appellant and the 911 call, both nearly contemporaneous with the crime, indicated (in the f their substance on the record) that garibay was hit, and that she was hit by the bottle. thus, despite confusion at trial, it was not reasonably probable that the jury would have found appellant guilty only of simple assault. prosecutor misled the jury into concluding that battery could be completed by throwing a bottle at garibay without actually touching her is not persuasive. evaluated as a whole. (people v. holt (1997) 15 cal.4th 619, 677.) even if the unanimity instruction was incomplete, the battery instruction included the touching element. similarly, although in closing the prosecutor skipped over that element, she clearly identified it in rebuttal. 11 that the jury returned a split verdict on counts 2 and 3 is not dispositive, and people v. mullendore, supra, 230 cal.app.4th 848, on which appellant relies, is distinguishable. the defendant in that case shattered a car window with his backpack after the driver honked at him for standing in the street. (id. at pp. 851852.) the defendant was charged with assault by means of force likely to cause great bodily injury, but the jury convicted him of the lesser included offense of misdemeanor simple assault. the jury was not instructed on the lesser included misdemeanor offense of throwing a substance at a vehicle. the defendant was convicted, as charged, of throwing a substance at a vehicle that is capable of causing serious bodily harm and with intent to cause great bodily injury, a felony. (id. at p. 853; see veh. code,  23110, subds. (a) & (b).) it was in that context that the appellate court noted: apply) force likely to produce great bodily injury . . . , there is a reasonable probability it also had doubts about whether defendant had the intent to inflict mullendore, at p. 857.) here, by contrast, counts 2 and 3 were based on different alleged conduct: hitting garibay with a bottle and breaking her phone. that appellant was acquitted of the vandalism charge as to the phone does not mean the jury had doubts about the battery charge as to the bottle. if anything, the split verdict indicates the jury consistently of the crime, where she mentioned being hit by the bottle but did not mention that appellant slapped the phone out of her hand or kicked it, over her inconsistent statements at trial. based on the entire record, appellant was not prejudiced by the lack of a simple assault instruction. 12 iii appellant challenges the condition person and property to search and seizure at any time of the day or night by any peace officer, including electronic devicesas facially overbroad.4 he argues that the condition must as a matter of law be expressly limited to searches for prohibited by law or since appellant did not object to the search condition in the trial court, on appeal he may make only a facial overbreadth challenge that raises pure issues of law and does not require consideration of the facts of his particular case. (in re sheena k. (2007) 40 cal.4th 875, 889.) we review such a challenge de novo. (in re shaun r. (2010) 188 cal.app.4th 1129, 1143.) appellant relies largely on people v. appleton (2016) 245 cal.app.4th 717, a case decided after riley v. california (2014) ___ u.s. ___, 134 s.ct. 2473 invalidated warrantless cell phone searches. even though riley was not a probation search case, the court in appleton, following riley 4 the minute order states this condition differently, and seizure at any time of the day or night, by any probation officer or other peace officer, with or without a warrant, probable cause ordinarily, where there is a t people v. farell (2002) 28 cal.4th 381, 384, fn. 2 [relying on oral pronouncement of probation conditions].) the minute order must ee people v. zackery (2007) 147 s minutes must accurately reflect what occurred at hearing].) 13 wealth of personal information that can be stored on electronic devices, rejected an electronics-search condition as overbroad appleton, at p. 727.) currently, there is a split of authority regarding the validity of broad electronics-search conditions of probation, and the issue is pending before the california supreme court.5 that have invalidated electronics-search conditions of probation is that the courts in those cases were presented with preserved as-applied challenges to such conditions, requiring facts and circumstances in each case. (see, e.g., people v. bryant, supra, 10 cal.app.5th at p. 402, people v. appleton, supra, 245 cal.app.4th at pp. 722723; but see in re p.o. (2016) 246 cal.app.4th 288, 297 [exercising discretion to reach forfeited as-applied challenge].) that is not our case. additional argument that the search condition must be based on reasonable suspicion of illegal conduct also is 5 see people v. trujillo (2017) 15 cal.app.5th 574, fn. 1, citing in re ricardo p. (2015) 241 cal.app.4th 676, review granted feb. 17, 2016, s230923; in re patrick f. (2015) 242 cal.app.4th 104, review granted feb. 17, 2016, s231428; in re alejandro r.

(id. at p. 114.) the court found the search valid because it was supported by reasonable suspicion and declined to consider the constitutionality of the suspicionless searches permitted by the condition. (id. at pp. 120, 121 & fn. 6.) since knights did not review the constitutionality of a suspicionless search condition, it does not stand for the proposition that such a condition is unconstitutional. nor did knights consider whether probationers completely waive their fourth amendment rights when consenting to warrantless search conditions, as the california supreme court has held. (see knights, at p. 118; people v. woods (1999) 21 cal.4th 668, 15 674675.) cases are not authority for propositions not considered. (people v. avila (2006) 38 cal.4th 491, 566.) we conclude that the search condition imposed by the court is not unconstitutionally overbroad on its face. disposition the judgment is affirmed. the minute order shall be amended to conform to the trial of the search and seizure probation condition. not to be published in the official reports epstein, p. j. we concur: willhite, j. manella, j.
