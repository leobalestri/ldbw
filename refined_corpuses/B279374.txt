(a)); oral copulation with or sexual penetration of a.q., a child 10 years old or younger, on or between september 10, 2011, and july 23, 2014, (counts 24;  288.7, subd. (b)); committing a lewd act upon a.q., a child under the age of 14, on or between september 10, 2011, and july 23, 2014, (count 5;  288, subd. (a)); criminal threats against a.q. on or between september 10, 2011, and july 23, 2014 (count 6;  422); oral copulation with or sexual penetration of l.j., a child 10 years old or younger, on or between june 2, 2012, and july 23, 2014, (count 7;  288.7, subd. (b)); committing a lewd act upon l.j., a child 10 years old or younger, on or between june 2, 2012, and july 23, 2014, (count 8;  288, subd. (a)); corporal injury to l.j. on or between june 2, 2012, and july 23, 2014, (count 9;  273d, subd. (a)); criminal threats against l.j. on or between june 2, 2012, and july 23, 2014, (count 10;  422, subd. (a)); misdemeanor lewd practices in presence of minor l.j. (count 11;  273g); corporal injury to a.h. (count 12;  273d, subd. (a)); and misdemeanor lewd practices in the presence of minor a.h. (count 13;  273g). 4 as to counts 1 through 5, 7, and 8, it was further alleged the offenses were committed against more than one victim as specified in section 667.61, subdivision (e)(4). counts 11 and 13 were dismissed under section 1385. including testimony from mary, a.q., l.j., and a.h. a.q. testified times, beginning when she was eight years old until she was nine. a.q. also testified that he put his private part into hers nine times and sometimes hit her with his ring. this happened over the course ohe usually touched her in the garage when mary was sleeping. a.q. testified he would usually touch her with his hands first, then lick her private parts, and then touch her again. a.q. would sit on a stool. he also made a.q. touch his private parts with her hand and make her suck his private parts for five minutes until he told her it was candy, but she knew that was not true. a.q. clarified her testimony on cross-examination, explaining hoyle would remove all of her clothes while she sat on the stool. further, she testified that would fit into her private part and that it hurt her. hoyle told a.q. not to tell anyone and that if she did he would kill her mother. hoyle touched l.j.10 times, and forced her to orally copulate him. he likewise told l.j. not to tell anyone what happened. he threatened to hurt and kill her. on a.h. and l.j.clothing and touched their genitalia with his hand. he had l.j. orally copulate him and told a.h. to have l.j. orally copulate him 5 as well. a.h. refused. hoyle told a.h. not to tell anyone. hoyle presented no witnesses. during deliberations, the jury sent a note stating: larification in counts 2, 3 and 4. worded exactly the same. each party question. the people explained that three separate counts of oral copulation with a minor were filed because a.q. described three separate incidents without specific dates. defense counsel argued it demonstrated ambiguity and created reasonable doubt. after argument, the trial court reminded the jury that counts 1 5, 7, and 8 may be based on more than one act. however, all the jurors had to agree that he committed the same act or acts to return a guilty verdict as to any of those counts. (caljic no. 17.01.) the jury found hoyle guilty on all counts and found true the multiple victim allegation. hoyle was sentenced to an aggregate determinate term of four years in state prison, comprised of the middle term of four years on count 12 and concurrent terms on counts 6 (middle term of two years), 9 (middle term of four years), and 10 (middle term of two years). he was sentenced to an additional indeterminate term of 25 years to life on count 1, and to six terms of 15 years to life on counts 25, 7, and 8. the terms were ordered to run consecutively, for an aggregate indeterminate term of 115 years to life. hoyle timely appealed. discussion erred in ordering consecutive sentences on counts 3 and 5. we invited the parties to submit supplemental briefs addressing 6 whether consecutive sentences were mandatory on counts 15 and 8 and whether a sentence of 25 years to life was mandated for counts 5 and 8. (gov. code,  68081.) we conclude consecutive sentences were not mandated for counts 15 and 8, but that sentences of 25 years to life were mandated for counts 5 and 8, and therefore remand for resentencing. i. sentences on counts 15 and 8 relying on section 667.61, subdivision (i), the trial court believed consecutive sentences were mandatory on counts 15 and 8 if the crimes were committed against separate victims or on separate occasions. however, those counts do not fall within the purview of the mandatory consecutive sentencing portion of that statute, and we find remand for resentencing is required. while imposing the sentence, the trial court stated: sentences as to counts 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 8 should all run consecutively, as these counts were either against separate victims or o makes it clear that the trial court believed its task was to determine whether there were separate victims or separate occasions, and if it did so, it lacked authority to impose concurrent sentences on any of these counts. however, subdivision (i) of section 667.61 mandates consecutive sentences for crimes specified in paragraphs (1) to (7) of subdivision (c) or in paragraphs (1) to (6) of subdivision (n) of volve the same victim on separate occasions as defined by subdivision (d) of ( 667.61, subd. (i).) counts 15 and 8 are not offenses enumerated in the specified subdivisions. the people concede the trial court erroneously believed its sentencing 7 discretion was limited by section 667.61, subdivision (i) on those counts and we agree.2 the trial court, however, did have discretion to impose consecutive sentences on these counts. (cal. rules of court, rule 4.425 (rule 4.425).) the people urge us to conclude the error was harmless and that remand is unnecessary because the trial court would have imposed the same sentence even if it exercised its discretion. (see, e.g., people v. coelho (2001) 89 cal.app.4th 861, 889890.) while we acknowledge that this is a case where many factors weigh in favor of consecutive sentencing, especially considering the evidence and the compelling victim impact statement, we decline to make that determination for the trial court and instead find remand is necessary. (people v. giminez (1975) 14 cal.3d 68, 72.) proceeded with sentencing on the erroneous assumption it lacked discretion, remand is necessary so that the trial court may have the opportunity to exercise its sentencing discretion at a new sentencing hearing. [citations.] defendants are entitled to of its discretionary authority cannot exercise its informed (people v. brown (2007) 147 cal.app.4th 1213, 1228.) 2 we also agree with the people that do not come within the ambit of crimes with mandated consecutive sentences under section 667.6. ( 667.6, subd. (e).) 8 we find the trial court must be allowed the opportunity to exercise its fully informed discretion, given the array of options available to it to order consecutive sentences on all, some, or none of the six counts. ii. sentences on counts 5 and 8 the trial court sentenced hoyle to consecutive terms of 15 years to life on counts 5 and 8, both of which were convictions for lewd acts upon a child under the age of 14 in violation of section 288, subdivision (a). hoyle concedes, and the people agree, the trial court should have imposed sentences of 25 years to life on those two counts pursuant to section 667.61, subdivision (j)(2). section 667.61, subdivision (j)(2), mandates a sentence of 25 years to life for any person convicted of an offense specified in subdivision (c) of that section, under one of the circumstances specified in subdivision (e), committed upon a child under 14 years of age. s in counts 5 and 8 fulfill all of the criteria for a sentence of 25 years to life under that section. first, hoyle was convicted of committing a lewd act upon a child in violation of section 288, subdivision (a), which is an offense enumerated in subdivision (c)(8) of section 667.61. second, the people pled and proved a multiple victim circumstance under subdivision (e)(4) of section 667.61. third, both a.q. and l.j. were children under the age of 14 at the time of the crimes. accordingly, the trial court is directed, upon resentencing, to impose the required sentence of 25 years to life on counts 5 and 8. 9 disposition the judgment of conviction is affirmed. the sentence is vacated and the matter is remanded for resentencing consistent with this opinion. bigelow, p.j. we concur: rubin, j. flier, j.
