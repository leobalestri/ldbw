(a); count 1),1 dissuading a witness by force or threat ( 136.1, subd. (c)(1); count 2), and possession of a firearm by a felon ( 29800, subd. (a)(1); count 3). the jury found true the special circumstance that the murder was committed while defendant was engaged in the commission of a robbery ( 190.2, subd. (a)(17), 211), and also found true that defendant personally and intentionally discharged a firearm, causing great bodily injury and death ( 12022.53, subd. (d)). defendant admitted that he had suffered a prior felony conviction. on count 1, defendant was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole (lwop), plus 25 years to life for the firearm enhancement and five years for a serious felony enhancement pursuant to section 667, subdivision (a)(1). on count 2, defendant received an eight-year prison term to run consecutively with the sentence imposed on count 1. the sentence on count 3 was stayed pursuant to section 654. the trial court imposed various assessments and a restitution fine. in this timely appeal, defendant argues that (1) his lwop sentence violates the constitutional right to equal protection; (2) the trial court violated due process by imposing the assessments and restitution fine without first finding his ability to pay; and (3) pursuant to senate bill number 1393 (2017-2018 reg. sess.) (sb 1393), the matter must be remanded for the trial 1 all further statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise indicated. 3 court to consider exercising its new discretion to strike the previously mandatory five-year serious felony enhancement. we affirm. discussion the right to equal protection. defendant protection under both the federal and state constitutions. similarly situated to first degree willful, deliberate, premeditated but the former are punished more severely than the possibility of parole in every case where a person is killed during defendant asserts that this allegedly disparate treatment lacks any rational purpose. we disagree.2 2 the people argue that defendant forfeited his equal protection claim by failing to object or argue the issue below. we exercise our discretion challenge on the merits. (see people v. smith (2018) 4 cal.5th . . consistently considered the merits of attacks on the constitutionality of special circumstance allegations in capital cases even when they were not raised at people v. bloomfield (2017) 13 cal.app.5th 647, 657, fn. 5 [considering equal protection claim raised for the first time on pure question of law that rest[ed] 4 a. relevant law and standard of review [e]qual protection of the laws (u.s. const., 14th amend.,  1; cal. const., art. i,  7)guaranteed under both the federal and state constitutionsmeans that persons similarly situated regarding the legitimate purpose of the law should receive like treatment. people v. morales (2016) 63 cal.4th 399, 408.) he federal and state [equal protection] clauses are analyzed in substantially the same manner. people v. wolfe (2018) 20 cal.app.5th 673, 686 (wolfe).) no equal protection violation exists if the persons are not similarly situated or treated differently. (people v. castel (2017) 12 cal.app.5th 1321, 1326.) but if these prerequisites are established and where, as here,3 the law challenged neither draws a suspect classification nor burdens fundamental rights, [w]e find a denial of equal protection only if there is no rational relationship between a disparity in treatment and some legitimate government purpose. people v. chatman (2018) 4 cal.5th 277, 288289.) we review equal protection claims de novo. (wolfe, supra, 20 cal.app.5th at p. 687.) 3 defendant does not contend that, as a felony murderer, he is a member of a suspect class. nor could he. (see dickerson v. latessa (1st cir. 1989) 872 f.2d 1116, 1119.) and, a criminal defendanterm of imprisonment or in the designation a particular crime (people v. wilkinson (2004) 33 cal.4th 821, 838 (wilkinson).) 5 b. under binding precedent, the felony-murder special circumstance is constitutional. courts have consistently upheld the constitutionality of the felony-murder special circumstance. (see people v. covarrubias (2016) 1 cal.5th 838, 934; people v. bonillas (1989) 48 cal.3d 757, 780 [murder death eligible does not v.) our supreme court has specifically rejected equal protection challenges (see people v. taylor (1990) 52 cal.3d 719, 747748; people v. anderson (1987) 43 cal.3d 1104, 1147 generally accepted that a death penalty law that makes the felony murderer but not the simple murderer death-eligible does not violate the equal protection clause, superseded by statute on other grounds as stated in people v. mil (2012) 53 cal.4th 400, 408409.) we are bound by these cases. (auto equity sales, inc. v. superior court (1962) 57 cal.2d 450, 455.) defendant seemingly acknowledges this precedent and states that he does not ask us to overrule it. but he provides us with no persuasive argument or legal authority to accept his constitutional challenge without disregarding binding case law. c. the penal code does not eliminate the possibility of parole for all felony murderers. we also the false premise that lwop and death are the only punishments available for first degree felony murder. to the contrary, first degree murder based on a felony-murder theorylike all first degree murdersimprisonment in the state prison for life without the possibility of 6 parole, or imprisonment in the state prison for a term of 25 years 190, subd. (a), italics added.) indulging degree murder based on a felony-murder theory ( 189, subd. (a)) and the felony-murder special circumstance ( 190.2, subd. (a)(17)) functionally identical[,the fundamental distinction remains that a prosecutor must allege and prove beyond a reasonable doubt the special circumstance for it to affect and limit the sentencing options ( 190.4, subd. (a)). prosecutorial discretion over charging decisions that implicate different sentencing provisions does not violate equal protection provided that the discretionary decision is not based on invidious discrimination. (u.s. v. batchelder (1979) 442 u.s. 114, 123125; wilkinson, supra, 33 cal.4th at pp. 838839; people v. brown (2017) 14 cal.app.5th 320, 339340; people v. wallace (1985) 169 cal.app.3d 406, 409411.) defendant makes no claim here that the decision to charge him with the felony-murder special circumstance was based on any improper reason. we conclude that no equal protection violation has occurred and ii. the trial court properly imposed assessments and a restitution fine. defendant argues that the trial court erred in imposing a $30 per count court facilities assessment (gov. code,  70373), a $40 per count court operations assessment (gov. code,  1465.8), and a $300 restitution fine (gov. code,  1202.4) without first determining that he is able to pay, in violation of his right to due process. in support, he relies on people v. dueas (2019) 30 cal.app.5th 1157, 11631173 (dueas). 7 we are not convinced. first, as pointed out by the people, any assessments or restitution. (see people v. frandsen (2019) 33 cal.app.5th 1126, 11531155 [bdueas applied law that was old, not new, even before dueasto pay. (see, e.g., people v. trujillo (2015) 60 cal.4th 850, 853854; people v. nelson (2011) 51 cal.4th 198, 227; people v. avila (2009) 46 cal.4th 680, 729.) yet defendant did not object or otherwise raise his concern about an alleged inability to pay the assessed amounts. as a result, the issue has been forfeited on appeal. (see, e.g., people v. gibson (1994) 27 cal.app.4th 1466, 14681469.) setting aside this procedural obstacle, defendant still offers no basis for reversal. based on the constitutional guarantee of due process and ban on excessive fines, dueas held that trial courts may not impose three of the standard criminal assessments and finesnamely, the $30 court facilities assessment (gov. code,  1465.8), the $40 court operations assessment (gov. code,  70373), and the $300 restitution fine (gov. code,  1202.4)dueas, supra, 30 cal.app.5th at pp. 1164, 1171, fn. 8.) we need not decide whether we agree with dueas because defendant is not entitled to a remand even if we accept dueas. that is because the record in this case, unlike the record in dueas, indicates that defendant has the ability to pay the imposed assessments and restitution fine wages . . . people v. hennessey (1995) 37 cal.app.4th 1830, 1837; see also people v. gentry (1994) 28 cal.app.4th 1374, 1376 8 1377.) prisoners earn wages ranging from $12 per month (for the lowest skilled jobs) to $72 per month (for the highest). (cal. dept. of corrections & rehabilitations, operations manual,  51120.6, sentence, he will have enough money to pay the assessments and fine. even if defendant does not voluntarily use his wages for this purpose, the state may garnish between 20 and 50 percent of those wages to pay the restitution fine. ( 2085.5, subds. (a) & (c); people v. ellis (2019) 31 cal.app.5th 1090, 1094.) because upporting his people v. gamache (2010) 48 cal.4th 347, 409), a remand would serve no purpose. iii. remand for the trial court to consider striking the serious felony enhancement is not required. while this appeal was pending, sb 1393, effective january 1, 2019, amended section 667, subdivision (a), and section 1385, subdivision (b), to give trial courts discretion to strike the imposition of a five-year sentencing enhancement for a prior serious felony conviction. (people v. garcia (2018) 28 cal.app.5th 961, 971 (garcia).) although sb 1393 applies retroactively to nonfinal judgments of conviction where a serious felony enhancement was imposed at sentencing (garcia, supra, 28 cal.app.5th at pp. 971972)e are not required to remand to allow the [trial] court to the record shows that the trial court clearly indicated when it originally sentenced the defendant that it would not in any event have stricken [the] . . . enhancement even if it had the discretion. [citation.] [] the trial court need not have specifically stated at sentencing it would not strike the 9 enhancement if it had the discretion to do so. rather, we review what its intent would have been. people v. jones (2019) 32 cal.app.5th 267, 273 (jones).) we agree with the people that remand is not required here, where other respects demonstrated that it would not have stricken the serious felony enhancement had it been within its discretion to do so. at sentencing, the trial court declined to exercise its discretion to strike the 25-year-to-life firearm enhancement because it would not the court a depraved heart and a desire to harm the woman who was a well-liked employee, pleasant to all customers, and a mother of five. this is an extremely sad case given the acts that were committed by on count 2 for dissuading a witness, the trial court imposed the high term of four years, which was doubled to eight for the prior strike. the court found criminal history, in based on tand its decisions to impose a high sentencing term and not to strike the firearm enhancementjones, supra, 32 cal.app.5th at p. 274.) 10 in support of remand, defendant cites people v. billingsley (2018) 22 cal.app.5th 1076 (billingsley). we find that case distinguishable. in billingsley, the appellate court concluded that remand was appropriate because the record [did] not the [trial] court would not have exercised discretion to strike the firearm allegations had the court known it had that discretionid. at p. 1081.) the trial court had not express[ed] an intention to impose the maximum possible sentenceibid.); rather, it as tragic and unfortunate, in many ways, for [the defendant]id. at p. 1080). here, in contrast, the trial court expressed no sympathy for defendant and exercised its discretion where it could to impose the maximum sentence. because it would be an idle act under these circumstances, we decline to remand for resentencing. disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. _____________________, j. ashmann-gerst we concur: ________________________, p. j. lui ________________________, j. chavez
