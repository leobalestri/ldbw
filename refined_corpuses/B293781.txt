(d)(1)).1 the trial court suspended the imposition of sentence and placed defendant on formal probation for three years, which included the requirements that she (1) complete 400 hours of community service, (2) regularly report to the probation office, (3) pay restitution of $500 to the victim, and (4) pay fines, fees and the costs of probation that came to an additional $3884. in april 2016, defendant admitted to violating her probation. the trial court revoked probation, but reinstated her probation. in november 2017, defendant again admitted to violating her probation. the trial court revoked probation, imposed a high-end sentence of three years in the county jail, but suspended execution of that sentence and reinstated her probation. the court impos-year sentence he imposed should probation be revoked, and she be sentenced. 1 all further statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise indicated. 3 s probation after the probation office reported that, in nearly three years of probation, defendant (1) had not completed any of the 400 hours of community service (or, for that matter, even enrolled in the community service program), (2) had reported to the probation office for only six of the 34 monthly appointments, and (3) had paid only $35 of the $4384 she owed as restitution, fines, fees and costs of probation. in september 2018, the court held a probation revocation hearing. two witnesses testifiedofficer and defendant. the court found that defendant had complete . . . fail[ing] to pay the cost of that [defendant] . . . can possibly be successful in completing her omplet[ing] her probationary because the court had, in november 2017, imposed a specific sentence but suspended its execution, the court the court then imposed the previously imposed sentence of three years in the county jail. defendant filed a timely appeal. discussion defendant argues that the trial court abused its discretion in terminating her probation and in sentencing her to the previously imposed sentence of three years in the county jail. 4 when a trial court imposes sentence upon a defendant but suspends its execution in order to place that defendant on probation, the court at any subsequent probation violation hearing must decide: (1) whether the defendant violated the terms of her probation; (2) if there was a violation, whether to reinstate probation or terminate probation; and (3) if the court terminates probation, what sentence to impose. ( 1203.2, subds. (a), (b)(1) & (c); people v. medina (2001) 89 cal.app.4th 318, 321.) the third decision is an easy one because, if the court terminates probation, the court must impose the previously imposed sentence. (people v. howard (1997) 16 cal.4th 1081, 1095.) with finding that probation is revoked for substantial evidence (people v. arreola (1994) 7 cal.4th 1144, 1161) and its decision whether to reinstate or terminate probation for an abuse of discretion (people v. bolian (2014) 231 cal.app.4th 1415, 1421 (bolian)). the trial court properly sentenced defendant to three years in the county jail. defendant does not dispute that substantial of her probation by failing to report, to complete (or enroll in) her community service obligation, or to make anything more than nominal payments toward her financial obligations. the court also explained why it was revoking probation rather than reinstating itnamely, that minimal efforts over the three-year probationary period all but established that reinstatement of probation would be of no use. the court then imposed the previously imposed sentence, as it was required to do. defendant offers two arguments in response. 5 first and chiefly, she argues that the court mistakenly and thus never exercised any discretion in deciding whether to exercise its discretion, defendant concludes, was itself an abuse of discretion. (see people v. sandoval (2007) 41 cal.4th 825, 847-ise discretion also may constitute an abuse bolian, supra, 231 cal.app.4th 1415. (people v. barnett (1998) 17 cal.4th 1044, 1107; bolian, supra, transcript certainly reflects that the trial court was feeling some reluctance and discomfort, as the court stated that it noindicates that its hesitance pertained solely to the sentence it knew it had to impose, and not its precursor decision whether to terminate or reinstate probation. the court did not hesitate or balk at all in determining that reinstating defendant on probation was not a viable option due to her demonstrated inability significantly, the court did not express any reluctance until it the assume the court was unaware of its discretion simply because it failed to explicitl(people v. weddington (2016) 246 cal.app.4th 468, 492.) we 6 trial court is presumed to have been aware of and followed the applicable laing its discretion [citation].(ruelas v. superior court (2015) 235 cal.app.4th 374, 383; see bolian is inapt. there, the trial court specificillegal and improper.(bolian, at pp. 1421-1422.) here, the trial court never indicated a belief that reinstatement was not an option; it simply expressed dismay that its hands were tied when it came to the sentence to be imposed. second, defendant cites people v. clancey (2013) 56 cal.4th 562 (clancey) imposition of the three year sentence in november 2017 was the product of improper judicial plea negotiations. we reject this suggestion as both untimely and unmeritorious. it is untimely because defendant neglected to appeal the november 2017 imposing but suspending execution of sentence. (people v. mora (2013) 214 cal.app.4th 1477, 1482 [order imposing but suspending execution of sentence is an appealable, final judgment]; people v. ramirez (2008) 159 cal.app.4th 1412, 1420-1421 [judgment final if not appealed in a timely fashion].) it is unmeritorious because clancey . . . inducement[s] defendant more leniently because [s]he foregoes [her] right to (clancey, at p. 575.) even if we assume this limitation applies to probation revocation proceedings, nothing in the record indicates a high-term sentence was an inducement to obtain an admission 7 request for a further chance to complete probation and agreed to give her that chance on the understanding that it would likely be her final chance. this was not impermissible. 8 disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. ______________________, j. hoffstadt we concur: _________________________, acting p.j. ashmann-gerst _________________________, j. chavez
