(a).) thus, proposition 47 added penal code section 490.2, which provides as follows: [penal code] [s]ection 487 or any other provision of law defining grand theft, obtaining any property by theft where the value of the money, labor, real or personal property taken does not exceed nine hundred fifty dollars ($950) shall be considered petty theft and shall be punished as a misdemeanor. (pen. code,  490.2, subd. (a).) appellant was convicted of violating penal code section 487, subdivision (a), for stealing property exceeding the value of $950. it follows that because proposition 47 reduced theft crimes to misdemeanors when, among other criteria, the value of the property stolen was $950 or less (pen. code,  490.2, subd. (a); people v. romanowski (2017) 2 cal.5th 903, 907), appellant is not eligible for resentencing. we have independently examined the entire record and are responsibilities. (people v. wende, supra, 25 cal.3d at p. 441; people v. kelly (2006) 40 cal.4th 106, 110.) no plausible basis for appeal appears in the record, and accordingly, we affirm the order. 4 disposition the order is affirmed. not to be published rothschild, p. j. we concur: johnson, j. bendix, j.
