(a)(1); count 1) and carrying a loaded firearm in a vehicle (former  12031, subd. (a)(1); count 2).3 accompanying the charges were allegations that appellant had suffered two prior convictions constituting strikes under the three strikes law ( 667, subds. (b)-(i), 1170.12, subds. (a)-(d)). a jury found appellant guilty as charged, and found true the prior strike allegations. appellant was sentenced to 25 years to life on count 1, and a concurrent term of 25 years to life on count 2. in an unpublished opinion, this court affirmed the judgment. (see people v. farris (feb. 15, 2001, b139604).) b. petition for recall of sentence in 2012, the electorate enacted the reform act by approving proposition 36. (people v. yearwood (2013) 213 cal.app.4th 161, 167-170.) the reform act amended the three strikes law to provide that absent specified exceptions, an offender with two or more prior strikes is to be sentenced as a two-strike offender unless the new offense also is a strike, that is, a serious or violent felony.4 (see ibid.) the reform act also 3 those offenses are now codified in section 29800, subdivision (a)(1), and section 25850, subdivision (a). 4 under section 1192.7, subdivision (c). (people v. blackburn (1999) 72 cal.app.4th 1520, 1525.) 4 added section 1170.126, which creates a postconviction resentencing proceeding for specified inmates sentenced under the prior version of the three strikes law. (people v. yearwood, supra, at pp. 167-170.) under that statute, a defendant sentenced as a three-strike offender may petition for recall of the sentence and for resentencing, subject to certain eligibility criteria. ( 1170.126, subd. (e).) as our supreme court has explained, the ballot history of proposition 36 reflects that its rime, making room (people v. johnson (2015) 61 cal.4th 674, 691.) on january 11, 2013, appellant filed a petition for resentencing pursuant to section 1170.126. on june 28, 2017, the trial court denied the petition with prejudice, concluding that appellant was ineligible for resentencing because under the preponderance of the evidence standard, he was armed with a firearm during his commission of the offenses. this appeal followed. discussion appellant contends the trial court erred in finding him ineligible for resentencing under an exclusion that applies if offense which the resentencing petition targets] the defendant . . . was armed with a firearm or deadly weapon . . . .( 667, subd. (e)(2)(c)(iii), 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(c)(iii), 1170.126, subd. (e)(2); see people v. bradford (2014) 227 cal.app.4th 1322, 1327 (bradford).) he contends that as a matter of law, he cannot bthe commission of the targeted offenses because the loaded handguns were in the trunk 5 of his vehicle. alternatively, appellant contends that the matter should be remanded for a new hearing on his resentencing petition because the trial court found he was ineligible for resentencing under a preponderance of the evidence standard, rather than beyond a reasonable doubt, as required by people v. frierson (2017) 4 cal.5th 225 (frierson).5 a. the undisputed facts underlying aconvictions establish that he acommission of his offenses. the key issue before us concerns the circumstances under ineligible for resentencing under the reform act. generally, exclusion have sought guidance from people v. bland (1995) 10 cal.4th 991 (bland), which examined a sentencing enhancement set forth in section 12022, subdivision (armed with a firearm in the commission or attempted commission of a felony.bland, supra, at p. 998.) there, police officers executing a search residence found cocaine in the bedroom closet and a cache of firearms under the bed, including an ar-15 assault rifle. (id. at p. 995.) a jury convicted appellant of possessing the cocaine for sale and found true the allegation 5 frierson was decided after the trial court determined appellant was ineligible for resentencing. in frierson, our supreme court concluded that the people had the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the petitioner was ineligible for resentencing under the reform act, overruling, among other cases, people v. osuna (2014) 225 cal.app.4th 1020, 1040 (osuna). (frierson, 4 cal.5th at p. 240, fn. 8.) 6 that he was armed with an assault weapon during the commission of the drug offense. (id. at pp. 995-996.) our supreme court concluded that under the enhancement, the term armed for offensive or defensive use. (id. at p. 1001.) it further concluded ding on the arming enhancement, based on the close proximity to the possession of the cocaine. (id. at pp. 1003-1004.) the court also discussed with approval other scenarios where a offense, although the defendant did not carry the firearm on his person or have it nearby. (see bland, supra, 10 cal.4th at pp. 997-998.) most relevant to the instant case is people v. searle (1989) 213 cal.app.3d 1091 (searlea loaded 357 ruger in an unlocked compartment in the back of bland, supra, 10 cal.4th at p. 998, citing searle, at p.1099.)6 6 the other cases cited by bland were people v. martinez (1984) 150 cal.app.3d 579 (martinez) and people v. garcia (1986) 183 cal.app.3d 335 (garcia). in martinezevidence that during visible to the defendant, was sufficient to show that the (bland, supra, 10 cal.4th at p. 997.) in garcia, a burglar was found to be where before entering the house through the garage, he left a loaded handgun on a low wall outside the garage. (bland, at p. 998.) 7 numerous courts have determined that where, during the commission of a target offense, a defendant was as specified in bland, he is ineligible for resentencing under the reform act. (e.g., people v. superior court (cervantes) (2014) 225 cal.app.4th 1007, 1012-1018; osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at pp. 1028-1038; people v. elder (2014) 227 cal.app.4th 1308, 1312-1314 & fn. 7 (elder); people v. hicks (2014) 231 cal.app.4th 275, 283-284 (hicks).) appellant contends, however, that he was not armed because the loaded handguns were in the trunk of his vehicle. we disagree. it is well settled that a defendant is armed with a weapon even though it is not carried on his person, when he is aware it is people v. white (2016) 243 cal.app.4th 1354, 1362 [defendant not eligible for was aware of handgun hidden in trashcan and walked past it while being chased by police].) elder and cervantes are instructive. in elder, police officers executing a search warrant for an apartment found the defendant standing outside the apartment. (elder, supra, 227 cal.app.4th at p. 1317.) the defendant admitted that he lived there. (ibid.) inside the apartment, the officers discovered two guns and a photo of the defendant holding one of them. (ibid.) following his conviction for being a felon in possession of a firearm, he was sentenced as a three-strike offender. (id. at p. 1311.) the trial court denied the defendant petition for resentencing under the reform act, concluding that that the defendant possessed the firearms under conditions in which the guns were readily id. at p. 1317.) the 8 appellate court affirmed, upholding the trial courtdetermination that the defendant was ineligible for resentencing. (ibid.) in cervantes, police officers executing a search warrant of the sidence found him standing inside the doorway. heroin was found in the kitchen. about eight feet away from the drug cache, loaded handgun was found in an adjacent bedroom, inside a purse belonging to his wife. (cervantes, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1011.) he was convicted of possessing heroin for sale and sentenced as a three-strike offender. (ibid.) after t resentencing petition, the people sought a writ of mandate. the appellate court granted relief, concluding that as a matter of law, the defendant was ineligible for resentencing under the reform act -related offense. (id. at pp. 1013-1018.) here, the record establishes that appellant was the driver, owner and sole occupant of a vehicle containing loaded firearms in the trunk.7 at any time the vehicle was stopped, he could open 7 was aware of the guns in the trunk. (see people v. snyder (1982) 32 cal.3d 590, 592 [knowledge of possession or custody of firearm is an element of the offense of being a felon in possession of a firearm]; calcrim no. 2530 [knowledge of presence of weapon is element of offense of carrying a loaded firearm].) as to other facts not numerous courts have held that the trial court may independently examine the record of conviction in order to make determinations regarding them. (e.g., osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1040; elder, supra, 227 cal.app.4th at pp. 9 the trunk with his car keys and access the weapons for offensive or defensive purposes. thus, on the undisputed facts, as a matter of law, appellant was armed during the commission of the target offenses. appellant argues that while driving, he was not , as the firearms were [his] especially ready access. appellant acknowledges that these factors -- within reach and especially ready access -- are taken from people v. balbuena (1992) 11 cal.app.4th 1136, 1139 (balbuena), which was later disapproved by bland, supra, 10 cal.4th at page 1001, footnote 4. in balbuena, police executing a search warrant of a house found the defendant and his wife sleeping in the living room. about 10 feet away, in unlocked suitcases, officers recovered narcotics, cash and an unloaded pistol. (balbuena, supra, at p. 1138.) the defendant was convicted of two felony counts of drug possession, and the jury found true that he was personally armed during the commission of the drug offenses. (ibid.) the appellate court reversed the finding of personal arming, concluding that the evidence did not the pistol immediately before or after the police entered his home. (id. at p. 1139.) our supreme court faulted balbuena for focusing on the accessibility of the firearm at the time the police executed the search warrant, rather than during the commission of the drug offenses. (bland, supra, at p. 1001.) the court noted that the time that the defendant has possession of the unlawful drugs, 1314-1316; bradford, supra, 227 cal.app.4th at pp. 1338-1340; hicks, supra, 231 cal.app.4th at p. 275.) 10 it follows that [the arming] enhancement would apply to a defendant who has been found guilty of felonious drug possession and who, at some point during the illegal drug possession, had [a firearm] available for use in furtherance of the drug (ibid.) s on the time the vehicle was in motion, when appellant contends he could not have had ready access to the firearms in the trunk. however, appellant was convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm on or about august 19, 1998. that offense is felon in any way has a firearm within osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at pp. 1029-1030.) like felonious drug possession, being a felon in possession of a firearm is a continuing offense. (see people v. ford (1964) 60 cal.2d 772, 795, overruled on another ground by people v. satchell (1971) 6 cal.3d 28; accord, people v. ratcliff possession of [handgun] was not merely simultaneous with [his commission of two] robberies, but continued before, during and after those there is no dispute that appellant, a convicted felon, at various times on august 19, 1998, had ready access to the weapons in the trunk of his vehicle, including when he approached and entered it. moreover, whenever the vehicle was parked, appellant needed only to open the trunk to access the weapons.8 8 for carrying a loaded firearm, the same arming analysis applies to that offense. 11 aon osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th 1020 and people v. white (2014) 223 cal.app.4th 512, is misplaced for similar reasons. those cases stated that constructive possession of a firearm does not necessarily require that the possessor be armed with it, and then proceeded to illustrate that concept with a hypothetical. (osuna, at p. 1030; people v. white, at p. 524.) however, contrary to the admonishment in bland, the hypotheticals focused on the relationship between the defendant and the firearm at a specific point in time, not during the commission of an offense. (see osuna, supra, at p. 1030 [searched and a firearm is found next to his bed. the parolee is in possession of the firearm, because it is under his dominion and control. if he is not home at the time, however, he is not armed with the firearm, because it is not readily available to him for ]; people v. white, supra, 223 convicted felon may be found to be a felon in possession of a firearm if he or she knowingly kept a firearm in a locked offsite storage unit even though he or she had no ready access to the firearm ahere, wthe two firearms is viewed over the course of the day on which appellant was charged with being a felon in possession of firearms, it is apparent that he had ready access to the weapons for offensive or defensive use. appellant argues that our interpretation would deprive all defendants who have committed the offense of being a felon in possession of a firearm of the benefits of the reform act. we conclude that is neither true nor relevant. a felon in constructive possession of a firearm is not necessarily armed with the weapon during the time period in which he is charged with the offense. 12 for example, if a defendant were charged with being a felon in possession of a firearm found in his home on a specific date, the defendant would not be armed with the firearm during the commission of the offense if he were nowhere near his home on that date. more important, as the elder court observed, the great majority of commitments for unlawful gun possession come within our interpretation of this eligibility criterion, it woureform act. (elder, supra, 227 cal.app.4th at pp. 1313-1314.) finally, appellant argues that no evidence suggests that during the trip preceding the accident, appellant stopped the vehicle to access the weapons or arm himself. as explained, however, no direct evidence of physical possession is required to show a weapon was readily available for use. rather, evidence that a defendant could have taken possession of a firearm during the commission of the target offense is sufficient. (see, e.g., searle, supra, 213 cal.app.3d at p.1099 [firearm available for use where it was located in unlocked compartment in back of cervantes, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at pp. 1011-1018 [fcommission of drug offense where it was located eight feet from the drug cache inside here, the dispositive facts are not in dispute. appellant, a convicted felon, was found guilty of knowingly possessing and transporting loaded firearms in the trunk of his car. it requires no speculation to conclude that appellant could have accessed the weapons before entering his vehicle or after parking it. in sum, on the undisputed facts, 13 appellant was offenses.9 9 people v. berry (2015) 235 cal.app.4th 1417 (berry), overruled on other grounds by people v. estrada (2017) 3 cal.5th 661 (estrada), and people v. pena (1999) 74 cal.app.4th 1078, 1084 (pena) is misplaced. in berry, police conducting surveillance observed the defendant open the trunk of his cadillac and reach inside. he then entered and drove away in a stolen toyota. after being pulled over, the defendant was check. police searched the cadillac and found a loaded firearm in a briefcase in the trunk of the vehicle. appellant pleaded guilty to two forgery offenses, and the prosecutor dismissed all firearm-related charges. (id. at pp. 1419-1421.) subsequently, appellant filed a resentencing petition under the reform act, which was of the forgery offenses. (id. at pp. 1422-1423.) the appellate court reversed, holding that facts underlying a dismissed count may not be considered in determining whether a defendant was armed. (id. at p. 1427.) that broad holding was subsequently rejected by our supreme court, which held that a court may rely on facts underlying a dismissed count inderlie estrada, supra, at p. 674.) here, the trial court relied on facts underlying convictions. additionally, appellant was driving the vehicle containing the loaded firearms. in pena, the appellate court held that immediate personal possession of a loaded, operable firearm, health & safety code section 11550, subdivision (e), requires that the firearm be within the passenger compartment of the vehicle. (pena, supra, 74 cal.app.4th at p. 1088.) it rejected the attorney generalimmediate personal possessionarmed with the weapon, or having it id. at p. 14 b. the trial courterror in applying the preponderance of the evidence standard was harmless, and remand for a new hearing on resentencing petition is not warranted. as noted, the trial court preponderance of the evidence. subsequently, our supreme court held that the ineligibility determination must be found beyond a reasonable doubt. (frierson, supra, 4 cal.5th at pp. 239-240.) appellant brief argued selection of the lesser standard of proof was subject to review under the standard articulated in people v. watson (1956) 46 cal.2d 818 (watson), but his reply brief argued that the error was reversible per se. in support of the latter standard, appellant cites sullivan v. louisiana (1993) 508 u.s. 275 (sullivan) and in re francisco n. (1986) 186 cal.app.3d 175, disapproved on another point in in re manuel l. (1994) 7 cal.4th 229, 239, footnote 5. however, neither sullivan nor in re francisco n. involved errors of proof during postconviction resentencing. (see sullivan, supra, at pp. 280-282 [where jury rendered verdict based on unconstitutional reasonable-doubt instruction, error was reversible per se]; in re francisco n., supra, at pp. 179-180 [error in applof a proceeding wherein a juvenile is charged with an act which 1087.) however, the reform act does not use the term readily available for offensive or defensive use. (see, e.g., cervantes, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at pp. 1012-1018; osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at pp. 1028-1038; elder, supra, 227 cal.app.4th at pp. 1312-1314.) 15 ccurred in a postconviction proceeding, an act of lenity on the part of the electorate to which (people v. esparza (2015) 242 cal.app.4th 726, 740 (esparza).)10 a petitioner seeking resentencing under the reform act is not entitled to a jury trial on any facts to be found at the hearing on the petition. (ibid.) accordingly, we conclude that watson harmless error analysis applies. (see also people v. johnson (2016) 1 on resentencing petition pursuant to proposition 47 subject to watson harmless error analysis].) as explained above, even had the trial court applied the beyond a reasonable doubt standard, appellant would have been found ineligible for resentencing under the reform act. appellant contends the matter should be remanded for a new hearing, arguing that the trial court might make a different finding in light of the stringent beyond a reasonable doubt standard. however, appellant has not argued that there are any disputed facts relevant to the eligibility determination. as explained above, on the undisputed facts, appellant was armed during the commission of the target offenses. thus, remand would be an idle act. (see people v. coelho (2001) 89 cal.app.4th 861, 889.) 10 esparza was abrogated on another point by people v. cordova (2016) 248 cal.app.4th 543, 552, footnote 8 (cordova), but our supreme court subsequently overruled cordova on the same point (see people v. valencia (2017) 3 cal.5th 347, 351-352). 16 disposition the order petition is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. manella, j. we concur: epstein, p. j. collins, j.
