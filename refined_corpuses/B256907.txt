september 21, 1991, and september 21, 1994, w.b. and a.b. were watching television in bed with appellant. appellant was between w.b. and a.b. appellant put his hand on and inner thigh, and moved his

anyone else molest him. appellant gave w.b. a massage. appellant presented no defense evidence. issues appellant claims (1) the trial court erred by receiving uncharged sexual offense evidence, (2) the statute of limitations barred prosecution of count 8, and (3) the one strike law was inapplicable to any count because the people failed to plead and prove appellant was ineligible for probation. discussion 1. the court properly received the uncharged sexual offense evidence. a. pertinent facts. prior to trial, the prosecutor represented he intended to introduce, pursuant to evidence code section 1108,3 testimony from w.b. that, inter alia, appellant rubbed her legsher when she was about nine. appellant posed an evidence code section 352 objection.4 3 commission of another sexual offense or offenses is not made inadmissible by section 4 evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the probability that its admission will (a) necessitate undue consumption of time or (b) create substantial danger 7 the court indicated as follows. the legislature enacted evidence code section 1108 specifically to permit certain uncharged offense evidence in sex offenses cases. the proffer was w.b. was misconduct, she tried to leave, appellant asked her to stay and continued touching her, then she decided to leave and went to the bathroom. appellant later told w.b. he was testing her to make sure she would not let others touch her, and he told her not to tell anyone. the court indicated the evidence was such that a jury could decide whether appellant committed a sexual offenseevidence code section 1108, subdivision (d)(1)(a). proposed testimony5] that goes to the weight [and] ssible. the prosecutor also represented he intended to introduce, pursuant to evidence code section 1108, testimony from w.b. that appellant grabbed her breast when she was appellant objected w.b. was 16 at the time, the incident was unrelated, there was no remote from the alleged sexual offenses. the court indicated as follows. it was reasonably inferable w.b. did not consent to appellant touching her breast, and the act was sexual battery, a sexual offensethe meaning of evidence code section 1108, subdivision (d)(1)(a). the remaining issue was whether, under evidence code section 352, probative value outweighed prejudice, 5 the prosecutor had represented that appellant had engaged in concurrent 8 the court indicated the proposed testimony as to all alleged victims and the evidence could be hfind that the probative value is not outweighed by prejudice under evidence code section 352. the court ruled the proposed testimony was admissible. the prosecutor also represented he intended to introduce, pursuant to evidence code section 1108, evidence that, inter alia, appellant molested a.b. in illinois. the concerning the illinois molestation. appellant posed an evidence code section 352 objection. the court indicated as follows. the proffered evidence indicated appellant committed a sexual offenseevidence code section 1108, subdivision (d)(1)(a). the next issue was whether evidence code section 352 would disallow the evidence because prejudice outweighed probative value. the uncharged charged offense against a.b. the uncharged evidence was helpful to explain a pattern and as evidence of specific intent and lack of mistake. the court concluded that, under evidence code section 352, the probative value was not outweighed by prejudice, and the proposed evidence was admissible. b. analysis. appellant claims the trial court erred by admitting evidence of uncharged sexual offenses. he argues the trial court erred by admitting the evidence appellant (1) touched and grabbed her breast when she was 16, (2) molested 9 a.b. in illinois, and (3) molested a.b. after she returned to california. resolving the issue under familiar standards,6 to the extent appellant argues the trial court erred by admitting evidence he molested a.b. after she returned to california, appellant waived the issue by failing to object to the introduction of the evidence on the ground it was irrelevant, inadmissible under evidence code section 1108, or excludable under evidence code section 352. (cf. people v. valdez (2012) 55 cal.4th 82, 138-139; people v. pierce (2002) 104 cal.app.4th 893, 898; evid. code,  353, subd. (a).) as to the merits, when she was about nine was a lewd act upon a child ( 288, subd. (a)) about 16 was a sexual battery ( 243.4, subds. (a), (f) & (g)(1)) with the result each act was within 6 in people v. falsetta (1999) 21 cal.4th 903 (falsetta), our supreme court issibility of disposition or propensity evidence in sex offense cases. . . . [] available legislative history indicates section 1108 was intended in sex offense cases to relax the evidentiary restraints section 1101, subdivision (a), imposed, to assure that the trier of fact would be nce is per se unduly prejudicial to the falsetta, at p. 911.) [e]offenses constitutes relevant circumstantial evidence that he committed the charged sex id. at p. 920d and uncharged crimes need not be sufficiently similar that evidence of the latter would be admissible under evidence code section 1101, otherwise evidence code section 1108 would serve no purpose. it is enough the charged and uncharged offenses are sex offenses as defined in section 1108. people v. frazier (2001) 89 cal.app.4th 30, 40-41 (frazier).) when ruling on an evidence code section 352 issue, a trial court need not expressly weigh prejudice against probative value, or even expressly state it has done so. all that is required is that the record demonstrate the trial court understood and fulfilled its responsibilities under evidence code section 352. (people v. williams (1997) 16 cal.4th 153, 213.) we review for abuse of discreevidence code sections 1108 and 352. (people v. spicer (2015) 235 cal.app.4th 1359, 1382.) moreover, the application of ordinary rules of evidence does not impermissibly rocess. (cf. people v. fudge (1994) 7 cal.4th 1075, 1102-1103.) 10 the meaning of evidence code section 1108, subdivision (d)(1)(a). the court also reasonably could have concluded illinois misconduct that his two separate acts of touching vagina were each a lewd act upon a child ( 288, subd. (a)), his attempt to put his mouth on her vagina was attempted oral copulation of a minor ( 664, 288a, subd. (b)(2)) and his placing of his penis against her buttocks and on her vagina was attempted sodomy and/or attempted rape, with the result each act was a within the meaning of evidence code section 1108, subdivision (d)(1)(a) & (f). similarly, the court reasonably could have concluded meaning of evidence code section 1108, subdivision (d)(1)(a). the uncharged sexual offense evidence was relevant circumstantial evidence appellant committed the present offenses. (falsetta, supra, 21 cal.4th at p. 920.) moreover, with the enactment of declared that the willingness to commit a sexual offense is not common to most individuals; thus, evidence of any prior sexual offenses is particularly probative and necessary for determining the credibility of the witness.(review of [selected] 1995 cal. legislation [(1996)] 27 pacific l.j. 761, 762.)people v. callahan (1999) 74 cal.app.4th 356, 367.) all of the above to commit sexual offenses and, further, sexual offenses against children. all of the above proffered evidence (other than the evidence appellant grabbed was about against young children. all of the proffered evidence (other than the evidence pertaining against young female relatives. (cf. people v. hernandez (2011) 200 cal.app.4th 953, 967.) the offenses of which appellant was convicted represented a pattern of sexual offenses committed against children from april 1, 1995, through june 25, 2002, w.b. when she 11 was between perhaps six and nine (i.e., between perhaps september 21, 1991 and september 21, 1994), was highly probative to show the pattern existed even earlier. the on september 12, 1999 (in illinois) and in 2001 (in california, even after she, in illinois, had reported him to police for similar misconduct), as well as the proffered evidence breast in 2001 was highly probative to corroborate the existence of the pattern from april 1, 1995, through june 25, 2002. there were similarities between, on the one hand, each of the following categories, i.e., uncharged misconduct towards w.b. (between perhaps september 21, 1991, and september 21, 1994), (2) some of his 1999 uncharged illinois misconduct against a.b., and (3) his 2001 uncharged misconduct towards a.b., and, on the other hand, the offenses of which he was convicted in which a.b. and n.r. were victims. the trial court reasonably could have concluded the proffered evidence would not necessitate undue consumption of time, create a substantial danger of undue prejudice, confuse issues, and/or mislead the jury. the fact no evidence may have been presented appellant had been convicted of the uncharged offenses may have increased the risk the jury would convict him to punish him for the prior acts. however, frazier, supra, 89 cal.app.4th 30, discussing a similar issue, a risk does exist a jury might punish the defendant for his uncharged crimes regardless of whether it considered him guilty of the charged offense . . . . this risk, however, is counterbalanced by instructions on reasonable doubt, the necessity of proof as to each of the elements of [the charged t not convict the defendant of any crime with id. at p. 42.) here too, the court instructed the jury on reasonable doubt and on the elements of the counts. moreover, the court, using calcrim no. 2.50.01, instructed the jury to the effect the jury could consider uncharged sexual offenses as propensity evidence, but for (people v. sanchez (2001) 26 cal.4th 834, 852.) 12 in order to conclude a trial court abused its discretion, we must conclude the irrational, capricious, or patently absurd (cf. people v. delgado (1992) 10 cal.app.4th 1837, 1845; in re arthur c. (1985) 176 cal.app.3d 442, 446) and without even a fairly debatable justification (people v. clark (1992) 3 cal.4th 41, 111). we cannot conclude that here. the trial court did not abuse its discretion by failing to exclude the proffered evidence as irrelevant, inadmissible under evidence code section 1108, or excludable under evidence code section 352. nor did the application of fair trial. green, n.r., h.e., appellant admitted to green that appellant committed sexual misconduct against a.b., and admitted to ota that appellant committed sexual misconduct against a.b. and h.e. we note appellant -arrest statement [to ota], it is abundantly clear the prosecution did not need the uncharged sexual misconduct evidence the court, using calcrim no. 17.02, instructed the jury to decide each count separately. the fact the jury deadlocked on counts 4 and 7, involving victims k.r. and n.r., respectively, with the result the court declared a mistrial on those counts, suggests the jury was able to compartmentalize the evidence. (see people v. soper (2009) 45 cal.4th 759, 784.) even if the trial court had not admitted the challenged evidence, it is not reasonably probable a different result would have occurred. (cf. people v. watson (1956) 46 cal.2d 818, 836 (watson).) 13 2. the statute of limitations did not bar prosecution of count 8, and the one strike law applied to all counts. a. pertinent facts. count 8 of the information filed on may 6, 2013, the offense of lewd act upon a child in violation of section 288, subdivision (a) (hereafter, the sex offense).7 as to count 8, the information that the victim in the above offense is under 18 years of age and reported the offense to a responsible adult and agency on 05/24/11.meaning of penal code section 667.61[, former subdivision] (b), . . . as to counts [1 through 8] that the following circumstances apply: m on april 17, 2014, the court granted the people pretrial motion to amend count 8 by interlineation to substitute the date ending the period during which appellant committed the sex offense. the jury convicted appellant as previously indicated. as to count 8, the jury made no finding as to the section 803, subdivision (f) apenal code section 667.61, [former] subdivision (b), as to the defendant, that the following circumstances apply: the court found as to count 8, incident, and the offense was reported to a responsible agency on may 24, 2011, and that we will present additional facts where appropriate. 7 earlier, on may 29, 2012, (capitalization omitted) was filed alleging (1) appellant committed violations of section 288, subdivision (a) 14 b. analysis. (1) count 8 was not subject to a statute of limitations. (a) section 799 permitted prosecution of count 8 at any time. appellant claims prosecution of count 8 was time-barred.8 we disagree. we conclude for the reasons discussed below that, pursuant to section 799, prosecution of the sex offense could commence at any time. in people v. perez (2010) 182 cal.app.4th 231 (perez), a defendant convicted on three counts of forcible lewd act upon a child in violation of section 288, subdivision (b)(1) received a sentence of 15 years to life on each count pursuant to a one strike law multiple victim allegation found true as to each count. ( 667.61, former subds. (b), (c)(4), (e)(5)). (perez, at pp. 234, 236-237.) the defendant claimed as to two counts (counts 1 & 4) that section -year statute of limitation (applicable when the maximum punishment for an offense, such as a violation of section 288, subdivision (a) (here) or subdivision (b) (in perez) is eight years) barred prosecution of those counts. (perez, at pp. 236-237.) perez rejected claim. (id. at p. 234.) perez stated, defines the length of imprisonment for the substantive offense of violating section 288, subdivision (b)(1). thus, the unlimited timeframe for prosecution set out in section 799 for an oflife . . . applies, given that defendant was found guilty of violating section 288, subdivision (b)(1) and [former] subd. (e)(5)) was found guilty of another such violation involving another victim (ibid.), and therefore was subject to the 8 appellant argues prosecution of count 8 was facially time-barred to the extent it alleged appellant committed the offense from december 1, 1994, through december 31, 1995, inclusive, because, according to appellant (1) that period was beyond the otherwise applicable statute of limitations period and (2) there was no tolling because the section 803, subdivision (f) tolling provision alleged in count 8 did not allege the offense appellant relies on a version of subdivision (f) that was not in effect when appellant committed the offense alleged in count 8.) however, there is no need to decide these issues. 15 life-term sentencing provision contained in section 667.61, [former] (perez, supra, 182 cal.app.4th at pp. 239-240, second italics added.) isection 667.61[, former subdivision] (b), as to [inter alia, count 8] . . . that the following circumstances apply: former subdivision (e)(5) multiple victim allegation as to count 8, and, on that count, the court sentenced appellant to prison for 15 years to life pursuant to section 667.61, former subdivisions (b), (c)(7), and (e)(5) of the one strike law. we hold section 799 applied to count 8 with the result prosecution on that count could commence at any time; no statute of limitations applied to that count. (cf. perez, supra, 182 cal.app.4th at pp. 234, 236-237, 242; see anthony v. superior court (2010) 188 cal.app.4th 700, 718;  667.61, former subds. (b), (c)(7) & (e)(5), 799.) (b) none of s a contrary conclusion. appellant argues section 799 does not apply to count 8 because the people must or probation under [section 1203.066, former subdivision former subdivision (c)(7). at all times from december 1, 1994, through december 31, 1997, section 667.61, former subdivision (c)(7) this section shall apply to any of the following offenses: [] . . . [] (7) a violation of subdivision (a) of section 288, unless the defendant qualifies for probation under [former] subdivision (c) of section 1203.066(italics added.) there is no dispute the jury convicted appellant on count 8 of a violation of former subdivision (c)(7). appellant concedes the people alleged, and the jury found true, the section 667.61, former subdivision (e)(5) multiple victim allegation as to that count. appellant does not even dispute he was ineligible for probation under section 1203.066. people v. woodward (2011) 196 cal.app.4th 1143 (woodward) rejected the argument the people have to plead a defendant did not qualify for probation under section 1203.066. in woodward, a jury convicted the defendant on two counts of 16 violating section 288, subdivision (a) and found true a section 667.61, former subdivision (e)(5) multiple victim allegation. (woodward, at pp. 1145-1146.) the court sentenced the defendant on each count pursuant to the one strike law. (id. at p. 1146.) the application of the one strike law set forth in former subdivision (i)[9] of section 667.61 requires the pleading to allege that defendant is ineligible for probation as set forth in former section 1203.066woodward, at p. 1149.) woodward rejected the argument (woodward, supra, 196 cal.app.4th, at p. 1149) and later defendant asks us to impose a rule of pleading that would require the prosecution plead the absence of a fact that might decrease the penalty sought. we decline to do so. [] any fact serving to increase the penalty must be pled.id. at p. 1152, italics added.) woodward prosecution need not allege the absence of a factor, such as eligibility for probation, that may lighten the punishment on defendant.

(benitez, at pp. 1276-1277.) sentence included a sentence pursuant to the one strike law. (id. at pp. 1276-1277.)11 the defendant argued on appeal the people failure to prove he did not qualify for probation under section 1203.066 violated his constitutional right to a jury determination of every necessary fact. (benitez, at pp. 1276-1277.) benitez rejected the argument. (id. at p. 1276.) benitez contention, we find that the proviso in penal code section 667.61, [former] subdivision (c)(7) (that a defendant is unqualified for probation) is not an element of the enhancement to be negated [by the people] upon proof to a jury. rather, it is a legislative grant of authority to the trial court to entertain a request for probation (should a defendant satisfy the criteria in section 1203.066, [former] subd. (c)) despite eligibility otherwise for sentencing under section 667.61. . . . [] . . . eligibility for probation results in a reduction rather than an increase in the sentence prescribed for his offenses, it is not subject to the rule of [blakely v. washington (2004) 542 u.s. 296 [159 l.ed.2d 403]]. [citations.] as a 10 like appellant, the defendant in woodward cited people v. hammer (2003) 30 cal.4th 756, and people v. mancebo (2002) 27 cal.4th 735, in support of the woodward (woodward, supra, 196 cal.app.4th at pp. 1150-1152.) 11 the benitez (benitez, supra, he one strike law is not, . . . a sentence enhancement.people v. acosta (2002) 29 cal.4th 105, 118 [describing alternate penalty for the underlying felony 18 result, the enhancement of his molestation convictions did not offend his constitutional rights.benitez, supra, 127 cal.app.4th at p. 1278, first and second italics added.)12 woodward too supports a conclusion the people have no burden to prove woodward the prosecution to disprove, any eligibility for probation must be shown by the defendant. ndant has the burden to present evidence showing that he is entitled to consideration for probation under [former] (woodward, supra, 196 cal.app.4th at p. 1152.) we hold the people were not required to plead or prove appellant did not for probation under [former] within the meaning of section 667.61, former subdivision (c)(7). benitez teaches that after a defendant has been convicted of a violation of section 288, subdivision (a) with a true finding as to a one strike law multiple victim allegation, the court, at the time of disposition, may entertainunder the legislative authority granted by the phrase [former] subdivision (c) of section 1203.066 in section 667.61, former subdivision (c)(7)a request for probation as an alternative to the otherwise applicable one strike law sentencing, assuming the defendant satisfies the criteria specified in section 1203.066. in other words, the issue to which the above quoted language pertains arises at a probation and sentencing hearing when a defendant requests probation. in light of this, even if the people were required to plead as to count 8 that appellant did not qualif[y] for probation under [former] subdivision (c) of section 1203.066it does not follow we must reverse the judgment as to that count. first, at all times from december 1, 1994, through december 31, 1997, inclusive, section 1203.066 was materially the same (and hereafter we refer to that version of the section) 12 jury consideration of whether appellant qualified for probation would run afoul of the principle (reflected in calcrim no. 17.42 given to the jury) that a jury is not to consider or discuss the subject of penalty or punishment. 19 former subdivision (e)(5) multiple victim allegation satisfied the requirements of section 1203.066, subdivision (a)(7) and former subdivision (d), with the result the trial court was, by section 1203.066, subdivision (a), precluded as a matter of law from granting probation unless the court made all of the findings specified in section 1203.066, former subdivision (c). the trial court did not make any of those findings. second, at the june 5, 2014 sentencing hearing, after the court discussed the one strike law, the prosecutor indicated that at the 288 finding, it has to be unless the perthe prosecutor indicated (1) why the court should not grant probation, (2) the one strike law indicated the court should make findings, and (3) the prosecutor wanted the court to make a finding. the coafter the court sentenced appellant to prison, the prosecutor asked the court if it needed t had suffered two prior convictions for purposes of section 1203, subdivision (e)(4).) the later, the following occurred: [the prosecutor]: want to put one more thing on probation under the 1203. -- 1203.4 [sic], but also is the court finding that under the statute ever [sic] 667.61, [former] subdivision (c), that he was ineligible for probation under 1203.066? [] the court: (italics added.) third, when the sentencing hearing occurred, h.e. was 24 years old. with slight modification, what the court said in people v. wills (2008) 160 cal.app.4th 728 (wills), is equally applicable here: . . . conclude the plain language of former section 1203.066[, subdivision] s intent that a sentencing court shall have no authority, and thus no legal discretion, to grant probation to a defendant against whom a true finding under section 1203.066, subdivision (a)[(7)] has been properly made in a case in which the molestation victim is no longer a child at time of sentencing. we thus also conclude the court did not err to the extent it denied [appellant] 20 a grant of probation without expressly considering whether a grant of probation would have been in [] best interests at the time [appellant] molested [h.e. between december 1, 1994, through decembwills, at p. 740.) for each of the above reasons, any erroneous prosecutorial failure to allege as to count 8 that appellant did not for probation under [former] subdivision (c) of within the meaning of section 667.61, former subdivision (c)(7) was not prejudicial. (cf. watson, supra, 46 cal.2d at p. 836; woodward, supra, 196 cal.app.4th at p. 1153.)13 (2) the one strike law applied to all counts. appellant presents the related claim that, because the people failed to plead and prove he for probation under [former] subdivision (c) of section within the meaning of section 667.61, former subdivision (c)(7), the one strike law did not apply to any counts of which he was convicted. we reject the claim as to each count based on the above analysis there was no such pleading or proof requirement and the alleged pleading defect was not prejudicial.14 13 as mentioned, appellant does not dispute he was ineligible for probation under section 1203.066. nor does he contend the trial court erred by refusing to grant probation. 14 appellant maintains the language of the current one strike law is adverse to his argument but also maintains application of the current one strike law would violate ex post facto principles. there is no need to reach that issue because our analysis does not rely on the current one strike law. 21 disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports hogue, j. we concur: edmon, p. j. aldrich, j. judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
