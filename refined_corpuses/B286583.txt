(people v. lockheart (feb. 15, 2017, b255880) [nonpub. opn.].) on remand the trial court sentenced both jones and herbert to consecutive indeterminate state prison terms, aggregating, according to the trial court, 80 years to life. in this second appeal jones and lockheart contend the trial court erred in imposing a state prison term of 15 years to life for attempted willful, deliberate and premediated murder rather than a straight life sentence, as specified in penal code section 664, subdivision (a).1 they request we remand their case for resentencing on the substantive offenses and also to permit the trial court to decide whether to strike or dismiss the firearm-use enhancements imposed pursuant to section 12022.53, subdivision (d), under section 12022.53, subdivision (h), as amended effective january 1, 2018. we agree with their 1 statutory references are to this code. 3 arguments and remand the matter with directions to the trial court to correct the sentence imposed on the substantive counts and to consider how to exercise its discretion with respect to the firearm-use enhancements. factual and procedural background 1. the initial appeal and remand jones and lockheart were convicted of the attempted willful, deliberate and premeditated murders of robert holloway and marvin jefferson ( 187, subd. (a), 664). the jury also found true allegations jones and lockheart personally used and discharged firearms causing great bodily injury in the commission of the crimes ( 12022.53, subds. (b), (c), (d)) and the crimes were committed for the benefit of a criminal street gang ( 186.22, subd. (b)).2 the trial court sentenced jones and lockheart to consecutive terms of 15 years to life for the attempted murders, with an additional 25 years to life on the firearm-use enhancements, for total terms of 80 years to life in state prison. on appeal we affirmed the convictions, rejecting jones and s 2 for simplicity this opinthe benefit of direction of, or in association with any criminal street gang, with the specific intent to promote, further, or assist in any criminal people v. jones (2009) 47 cal.4th 566, 571, fn. 2.) 4 findings the attempted murder of jefferson was premeditated and the crimes were committed for the benefit of a criminal street gang. however, we found the record contained strong support for sentencing discretion, erroneously believing it was required to impose consecutive sentences for the underlying crimes. accordingly, we remanded the matter for resentencing as to both jones and lockheart.3 2. sentencing on remand on remand the trial court acknowledged the ambiguity reflected in the transcript of the original sentencing hearing, but stated it understood then, as it did on remand, its discretion with regard to concurrent and consecutive sentencing. nonetheless, because the matter had been remanded for a new sentencing hearing, the court explained it intended to reconsider whether to exercise that discretion and gave counsel for all parties the opportunity to supplement the record with additional information and to present argument on the appropriate sentence for each defendant. after considering the additional material presented and argument of counsel, as well as what had been before it at the 3 although lockheart did not raise the sentencing issue on appeal, we remanded for the trial court to resentence both jones and lockheart under our authority to correct unauthorized sentences at any time. because the case was remanded for resentencing, we did not address the argument presented by the people that the sentence as imposed was not authorized by section 664, subdivision (a)the argument jones and lockheart advance in the instant appeal. 5 will be identical as to the original sfinding of premeditation, that is a minimum parole eligibility of 15 years to life. with regards to the 12022.53, subsection (d), that is an additional and consecutive 25 years to life. and with regard to the 186.22believes the only error in sentencing was the 186.22 subsection (b) subsection (1) subsection (5) was originally stayed by the court; however, that cannot be stayed but has no effect on the actual sentence since what that does, it mandates a 15 minimum15-year minimum parole eligibility on the life term, but that is already in place because of the finding of the premeditation as to count 1. with regards toso the term for count 1 would be 40 years to life. with regard to count 2, it would be identical. . . . and that would be consecutive terms. so the aggregate amount of both is 80 years to life as to each the minute order from the november 17, 2017 sentencing . . 040 years to life imprisonment as to the base count (01) . . . 040 years to life imprisonment as to count (02) forthwith. the abstracts of judgment similarly indicate jones and lockheart are to serve consecutive indeterminate terms of 15 years to life on counts 1 and 2, with additional 25-year-to-life terms for the firearm-use enhancements. 6 discussion 1. the trial court erred in imposing 15-year-to-life terms for attempted willful, deliberate and premeditated murder jones and lockheart correctly assert that the trial court erred in imposing an indeterminate state prison term of 15 years to life for each count of attempted willful, deliberate and premeditated murder, an error the attorney general had identified in her brief in the initial appeal.4 as it relates to this offense, section 664, subdivision (a), proattempted is willful, deliberate, and premeditated murder, as defined in section 189, the person guilty of that attempt shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for life with the that section does not provide for a minimum term of imprisonment or a minimum parole eligibility date. (see  3046, subd. (a) [sentence shall not be paroled until he or she has served the greater of the following: [] (1) a term of at least seven calendar years. [] (2) a term as established pursuant to any other law that establishes a minimum term or minimum period of because the jury found true the special allegations that the offenses had been committed for the benefit of a criminal street gang, however, in lieu of the straight life term otherwise prescribed in section 664, subdivision (a), jones and lockheart are subject to section 186.22, subdivision (b)(5), which provides 4 because we were remanding the matter for resentencing, we did not believe it necessary to address the additional sentencing error pointed out by the attorney general. (see people v. lockheart, supra, b255880, at fn. 6.) 7 that anyone who commits a felony punishable by life be paroled until a minimum of 15 calendar years have been 5 accordingly, as jones, lockheart and the attorney general basically agree, the proper sentence for the attempted premeditated murder counts is life with the possibility of parole with a minimum of 15 years before parole eligibility.6 5 specifically, section 186.22, subdivisions (b)(1) and (b)(5), except as provided in paragraphs (4) and (5), any person who is convicted of a felony committed for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with any criminal street gang, with the specific intent to promote, further, or assist in any criminal conduct by gang members, shall, upon conviction of that felony, in addition and consecutive to the punishment prescribed for the felony or attempted felony of which he or she has been convicted, be punished as follows: . . . (5) except as provided in (4), any person who violates this subdivision in the commission of a felony punishable by imprisonment in the state prison for life shall not be paroled until a minimum of 15 calendar years have been serv 186.22, subdivision people v. brookfield (2009) 47 cal.4th 583, 592-593; people v. briceno (2004) 34 cal.4th 451, 460, fn. 7.) 6 tfor attempted willful, deliberate and premeditated murder led to , in -year minimum parole eligibility date on the life terms was already in place. 8 although essentially in accord on this principal point, appellants and the attorney general disagree on several more nuanced questions: (1) was specific reference to the 15-year minimum term for parole eligibility properly included by the trial court when ? the ; (2) even if properly included, did the court err when it then summarized the aggregate terms imposed as 80 years to life; and if so, should the related minute orders and abstracts of judgment, which similarly recast the sentence for attempted premeditated murder years to life,be corrected? jones and lockheart as the attorney general argues, the supreme court answered the first question in people v. jefferson (1999) 21 cal.4th 86, 101-102, footnote 3, a case, like the current appeal, that addressed the proper sentence for defendants convicted of attempted premeditated murders committed on behalf of a criminal street gang: of imprisonment in its sentence, a trial court gives guidance to the board of prison terms regarding the appropriate minimum term to apply, and it informs victims attending the sentencing hearing of the minimum period the defendant will have to serve before become eligible for parole. thus, when the trial court here minimum terms . . . (see people v. arauz (2012) 210 cal.app.4th 1394, 1405 [modifying judgment to strike 10-year gang enhanceme-year minimum parole eligibility terms]; people v. ramos (2004) 121 cal.app.4th 1194, 1209 [9 been life with the possibility of parole with a minimum term of 15 years before parole elig.) the answers to the additional questions are not so readily apparent. on the one hand, the legislature has plainly decided to refer to a life sentence with a minimum term in some contexts while denoting in others a life term with a minimum period of confinement before parole eligibility. for example, the ( 190, subd. (a)); and section 186.22, subdivision (b)(4)(b), provides the alternate punishment for a home invasion robbery committed for the benefit of a criminal street gang is life imprisonment with 15 in contrast to section person convicted of a felony punishable by imprisonment in state prison for life, if the crime was committed for the benefit of a 15 section 451.5, defining the elements of aggravated arson, provides the for 10  451.5, subd. (b)), but additionally provides release on parole until 10 calendar years have elapsed. ( 451.5, subd. (c); see also  667.7, subd. (a)(1) [defining son for life and shall not be eligible for release on parole for 20 and, as discussed, section 3046, which specifies the default minimum parole eligibility date of seven calendar years ( 3046, subd. (a)(1)), also states that an inmate serving a life 10 sentence shall not be paroled until he or she has served minimum term or minimum period of confinement under a life sentence before eligibility for parolelaw ( 3046, subd. (a)(2)), plainly suggesting the two terms are not identical in their meaning. (see roy v. superior court (2011) 198 uses a different word or phrase in one part of a statute than it does in other sections or in a similar statute concerning a related subject, it must be presumed that the legislature intended a regents of university of california v. superior court (2013) 220 cal.app.4th 549, 565.) on the other hand, in people v. jefferson, supra, 21 cal.4th 86, while recognizing a difference between an indeterminate sentence that expressly includes a minimum prison term (for example, the punishment for second degree murder, which is sentence that does not mention a minimum term (for example, the usual punishment for attempted premeditated murder, which , the supreme court held the minimum parole eligibility period in section 3046 is a ly doubled for second strike offenders under the three strikes law.

(people v. wong (2018) 27 cal.app.5th 972, 977, fn. note the trial court and parties referred to the total sentence as . . . this is common shorthand to refer to a life sentence with minimum parole eligibility. however, the shorthand pronouncement is incorrect because it indicates a minimum term exists, rather than ; see people v. robinson (2014) 232 cal.app.4th 69, 72, fn. 3 of parole does not have a minimum determinate term of seven years; rather, a person sentenced to such a term first becomes .) and the attorney general has not always advanced the position he advocates in this appeal. 12 (see people v. robbins (2018) 19 cal.app.5th 660, 678 be life, rather than seven years to life. the people concede .) as convenient as this shorthand may be, we agree with jones and lockheart it is not only imprecise but also incorrect. the sentence on each of the counts for attempted premeditated murder, committed for the benefit of a criminal street gang, with a true finding that the defendant personally discharged a firearm causing great bodily injury, should be life with the possibility of parole, with a minimum parole eligibility date of 15 calendar years, plus a consecutive indeterminate term of 25 years to life. to the extent the oral pronouncement of judgment, the november 17, 2017 minute order and the abstract of judgment reported the sentence on each count as 40 years to life, they must be corrected. 2. jones and lockheart are entitled to have the trial court consider whether to strike or dismiss the section 12022.53 firearm-use enhancements the trial court resentenced jones and lockheart following remand on november 17, 2017. at that time, pursuant to section 12022.53, subdivision (d), imposition of 25-year-to-life sentence enhancements for attempted premediated murder committed with the discharge of a firearm causing great bodily injury was mandatory. on january 1, 2018 an amendment to section 12022.53, subdivision (h), became effective, granting the trial court discretion to strike or dismiss an enhancement otherwise required to be imposed by section 12022.53. (see sen. bill no. 620 (2017-2018 reg. sess.)  not yet final, the 13 amendment to section 12022.53, subdivision (h), applies retroactively to them. (see, e.g., people v. chavez (2018) 22 cal.app.5th 663, 712; people v. woods (2018) 19 cal.app.5th 1080, 1090-1091; see generally in re estrada (1965) 63 cal.2d 740, 745.) accordingly, as the attorney general recognizes, remand is appropriate in this case to allow the trial court to exercise its discretion whether to strike one or more of the firearm-use enhancements imposed. disposition the matter is remanded with directions to the trial court to correct the consecutive sentences imposed on jones and lockheart for attempted willful, deliberate and premediated murder, committed for the benefit of a criminal street gang, to provide, as to each count, life with a minimum parole eligibility of 15 years, and to consider whether to strike or dismiss any of the firearm-use enhancements. perluss, p. j. we concur: zelon, j. feuer, j.
