(people v. wende (1979) 25 cal.3d 436.) on november 8, 2011, we directed appointed counsel to send the record and a copy of the brief to defendant and notified him of his right to respond within 30 days. we received no response. the record does not include a certificate of probable cause, and defendants notice of appeal states that it is based upon the sentence or other matters that arose after entry of the plea that do not affect the validity of the plea. (cal. rules of court, rule 8.304(b)(4).) we have reviewed the whole record under people v. kelly (2006) 40 cal.4th 106, focusing upon the sentence as that is the only matter that arose after entry of the plea. defendant and his codefendant were charged by information filed on august 17, 2010 with second degree robbery for snatching a pedestrians purse on july 16, 2010. (pen.code,  211.)1 the information also alleged that defendant had suffered two prior strike convictions ( 667, subd. (b)-(i), 1170.12, subd. (a)-(d)). the same convictions were alleged for purposes of section 667, subdivision (a). the prison terms defendant served on these convictions were alleged for purposes of section 667.5, subdivision (b). on may 9, 2011, defendant entered into a plea agreement that required him to plead no contest to robbery and to admit one of the two strike priors and two section 667, subdivision (a) enhancements, for a total sentence of 20 years. he was sentenced according to this agreement and was awarded 342 days of custody credit (298 days of actual credit and 44 days of conduct credit). the court imposed a restitution fine of $200 and an additional $200 suspended parole revocation restitution fine. ( 1202.4, subd. (b), 1202.45). additionally, the court assessed a $40 court security fee and a $30 criminal conviction assessment fee. ( 1465.8, subd.
