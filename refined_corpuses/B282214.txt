(a)) and assault with a firearm ( 245, subd. (a)(2)). the court also found perez personally used a firearm in the commission of the murder ( 12022.53, subd. (d)). 1 all further undesignated statutory references are to the penal code. 2 because, at this juncture, the facts of the underlying offenses are not directly relevant to the issue presented on appeal, we do not further detail them here. 3 it sentenced perez to 15 years to life in prison for the murder, plus a consecutive term of 25 years to life for the firearm enhancement, plus a consecutive one-year term for assault with a firearm, for a total of 41 years to life. it ordered victim restitution in an amount to be determined at a later hearing, and imposed a restitution fine, a suspended parole revocation restitution fine, a court operations assessment, and a criminal conviction assessment. perez filed a timely notice of appeal. discussion the matter must be remanded to allow the trial court the opportunity to exercise its discretion pursuant to amended section 12022.53 when the trial court sentenced perez in 2017, imposition of a section 12022.53 firearm enhancement was mandatory and the trial court lacked discretion to strike it. (see people v. franklin (2016) 63 cal.4th 261, 273; people v. kim (2011) 193 cal.app.4th 1355, 13621363.) the trial court and the parties recognized this limitation at the sentencing hearing. consequently, the trial court sentenced perez to a consecutive 25-years-to-life term for his use of a firearm. ( 12022.53, subd. (d).) effective january 1, 2018, the legislature amended section 12022.53, subdivision (h) to give trial courts authority to strike section 12022.53 firearm enhancements in the interest of justice. (sen. bill no. 620 (20172018 reg. sess.), stats. 2017, ch. 682,  2.)3 3 as amended, section 12022.53, subdivision (h) provides: he interest of justice pursuant to section 1385 and at the time of sentencing, strike or dismiss an enhancement otherwise required to be imposed by this section. the authority provided by this subdivision applies to any resentencing that may occur pursuan 4 perez contends his case must be remanded to allow the trial court to exercise its discretion to strike the firearm enhancements, and the people agree. the parties are correct. the amendment to section 12022.53 applies to cases, such as operative. (people v. watts (2018) 22 cal.app.5th 102, 119; people v. arredondo (2018) 21 cal.app.5th 493, 507; people v. woods (2018) 19 cal.app.5th 1080, 10901091; people v. brown (2012) 54 cal.4th 314, 323; people v. vieira (2005) 35 cal.4th 264, 305306; people v. nasalga (1996) 12 cal.4th 784, 792; in re estrada (1965) 63 cal.2d 740, 745.) remand is necessary to allow the trial court an opportunity to exercise its sentencing discretion under the amended statute. (see people v. gutierrez (2014) 58 cal.4th 1354, 1391; people v. brown (2007) 147 cal.app.4th 1213, 1228.) we express no opinion about how the 5 disposition the judgment of conviction is affirmed. the matter is remanded to allow the trial court to exercise its discretion and determine whether to strike or dismiss the section 12022.53, subdivision (d) firearm enhancement pursuant to section 12022.53, subdivision (h). not to be published in the official reports edmon, p. j. we concur: egerton, j. kalra, j.* * judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
