(a).) whether proposition 47 applies to the offense of burglary of a vehicle is a question of statutory interpretation, which we review de novo. (see people v. bush (2016) 245 cal.app.4th 992, 1003.) in doing so, we apply the same principles that govern statutory construed in the context of the statute as a whole and the overall statutory scheme. [citation.] if a penal statute is still reasonably susceptible to multiple constructions, then (people v. rizo (2000) 22 cal.4th 681, 685-686; accord, people v. marks (2015) 243 cal.app.4th 331, 334; see professional engineers in california government v. kempton (2007) 40 cal.4th 1016, 1043 (kempton4 -settled princi le concedes, and we agree, that the ordinary meaning of the language of proposition 47 does not reduce the offense for burglary of a vehicle under section 459 to a misdemeanor. (see 1170.18 [listing the sections proposition 47 added or amended]; chen, supra459 is not one of the reduced offenses included in the text of proposition 47, except to the extent that new section 459.5the misdemeanor crime of shopliftingnow appliespeople v. acosta [n]or its attempt [is] by proposition 47].) notwithstanding this concession, le argues that other sections proposition 47 added or amended create an ambiguity concerning whether voters intended to reduce burglary of a vehicle under section 459 to a misdemeanor when the value of property taken does not exceed $950. he argues that the expressed intent to reduce certain theft offenses, including shoplifting ( 495.5), which was previously punishable as burglary under section 459 (see chen, supra, 245 cal.app.4th at p. 326), suggests voters similarly intended to reduce all second-degree burglary offenses under section 459. as le punishment for theft offenses like petty theft (not limited to shoplifting) where the value of the property does not exceed $950. we agree with the other courts that have rejected this argument. as the court explained in acosta, supra, 242 cal.app.4th 521, in rejecting the that burglary of a vehicle is within the -, offenseid. at p. 526; see ibid. eft ) [t]he crime of burglary can be committed without an actual taking, as opposed to the crimes of theft, robbery, and carjacking. (ibid.) burglary of a vehicle, vehicle as defined by the vehicle code, when 5 the doors are locked . . . with intent to commit grand or petit larceny. (ibid.; see people v. magallanes (2009) 173 cal.app.4th 529, 535-536 [because [a] burglary is committed when the defendant enters one of the premises specified in the statute with the intent to steal something or commit any felonycrime of burglary can be committed without an actual taking, as opposed to the crimes of theft, robbery, and carjacking].) thus, even assuming voters intended proposition 47 to reduce such an intent would not include the offense of burglary of a vehicle. (see acostaand unlike burglary, is a crime centered on the felonioumoreover, [s]ection 459.5 [shoplifting] makes reference to no other type of burglary, and it provides no reason to believe that burglary of a locked motor vehicle is now a misdemeanor when the loss does not exceed $950 (id. at p. 527.) thus, the statutory language of proposition 47 makes clear that burglary, when charged as a felony under section 459, remains a felony offense following volved a theft from a commercial establishment, and the theft involved less than $950, in which case the offense is now shoplifting under section 459.53 (chen, supra, 245 cal.app.4th at p. 327.) this is true of the offense of burglary of a vehicle in particular. (see acosta, supra, 242 cal.app.4th at pp. 526- because nothing in the ordinary meaning of the statutory language or the overall statutory scheme suggests voters intended proposition 47 to reduce an offense for burglary of a vehicle to a misdemeanor, we need not resort, as le suggests, to examining relying on the rule of lenity. (see people v. rizo, supra, 22 cal.4th at pp. 685-686.) bsent ambiguity, we presume that the voters intend the meaning apparent on the face of an 3 le does not contend his offense for burglary of a vehicle meets the definition of shoplifting under section 459.5. 6 initiative measure [citation] and the court may not add to the statute or rewrite it to conform to an assumed intent that is not apparent in its langu (people v. mulcrevy if the language of a voter-enacted [citations.] we presume that the voters intended the meaning apparent on the face of the people v. cordova (2016) 248 cal.app.4th 543, 557, review granted aug. 31, 2016, s236179; see arias v. superior court (2009) 46 cal.4th 9people v. curry (2016) 1 cal.app.5th 1073, 1076 [i]f the language is clear and unambiguous there is no need for construction, nor is it necessary to resort to indicia of the intent of the legislature (in the case of a statute) or of the voters (in the case of a provision adopted by the voters)people v. vasquez (2016) 247 cal.app.4th 513, 519 .) disposition the judgment is affirmed. segal, j. we concur: perluss, p. j. garnett, j. * *judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
