(a)(1)),1 health & saf. code,  11379.6; count 8, manufacturing pcp (health & saf. code,  11379.6, subd. (a)); counts 9 and 12, possessing pcp for sale (health & saf. code,  11378.5); count 13, manufacturing pcp (health & saf. code,  11379.6, subd. (a)); count 18, manufacturing pcp (health & saf. code,  11379.6, subd. (a)); count 19, possessing to manufacture pcp (health & saf. code,  11383, subd. (b)(1)); and count 20, possessing a firearm with a prior (former  12021.1). on counts 1 and 12, the jury found true a weight enhancement allegation, i.e., the amount of pcp exceeded 100 liters by volume (health & saf. code,  11370.4, subd. (b)(2)). based on prior strikes, byers was sentenced, on counts 8, 12 and 13 to 25 years to life, for a total of 75 years to life in prison. on counts 19 and 20, he was sentenced to concurrent 25-years-to-life terms.2 sentences on counts 1, 9 and 18 were stayed. in december 2012, byers petitioned for resentencing under proposition 36. the people opposed the petition on the ground that byers was ineligible for resentencing because of the firearm conviction (count 20) and the true findings on the weight enhancement allegations (counts 1 and 12). the trial court agreed that the true findings 1 all further statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise indicated. 2 an amended abstract of judgment filed in july 2001 indicates that the sentence on count 20 was consecutive and not concurrent. correction in the trial court. 3 on the weight enhancement allegations rendered byers ineligible for relief and denied the petition on november 10, 2014. discussion byers contends, and the people agree, that byers was eligible for relief under proposition 36 as to counts 8, 9, 13, 18 and 19. they disagree about the scope of remand as to count 20 and eligibility for relief on counts 1 and 12, the counts on which the weight enhancement allegations were found true. first, under proposition 36 is evaluated on a count-by-count basis. (people v. johnson (2015) 61 cal.4th 674, 688.) an inmate may therefore obtain resentencing with respect to a three-strikes sentence imposed for a felony that is neither serious nor violent, despite the fact that the inmate remains subject to a third strike sentence of 25 years to life. (ibid.) s for manufacturing pcp (counts 8, 13 and 18), possessing pcp for sale (count 9); and possessing with intent to manufacture pcp (count 19) are not serious or violent felonies. ( 667.5, subd. (c), 1192.7, subd. (c).) the record also reveals no other disqualifying factors. ( 1170.126, subd. (e)(2) & (3).) byers is therefore eligible for resentencing on counts 8, 9, 13, 18 and 19. second, byers is not eligible for resentencing on his conviction for possessing a firearm with a prior (count 20), if [d]uring the commission of the current offense, the defendant used a firearm, was armed with a firearm or deadly weapon, or intended to c)(iii), 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(c)(iii).) although the record suggests byers neither used a firearm nor was armed with one during the commission of the current offense, unlawful possession of a firearm may constitute being armed during an offense, for example, where a defendant has constructive possession of a weapon.3 (see, e.g., people v. white (2014) 223 cal.app.4th 3 this dthe residence where two guns were later found during a search. also, at the hearing on 4 512, 524; people v. elder (2014) 227 cal.app.4th 1308.) such possession may render an inmate ineligible for resentencing. because it appears that the trial court did not consider that issue, the court, on remand, may do so and determine whether byers is eligible for resentencing on count 20. finally, the jury found true weight enhancement allegations (health & saf. code,  11370.4) as to counts 1 and 12, but byers was not sentenced on the enhancements.4 because he was not sentenced on those enhancements, byers argues he was eligible for resentencing. section 1170.126, subdivision (e)(2), provides that an inmate is eligible for appearing insections 667, subdivision (e)(2)(c)(i)-(iii), and 1170.12, subdivision (c)(2)(c)(i)-(iii). as relevant here, scurrent offense is a controlled substance charge, in which an allegation under section 11370.4 . . . of the health and safety code was admitted or found true. health and safety code section 11370.4 weight enhancements does not render byers eligible for resentencing on counts 1 and 12. rather, those enhancements were found true by the jury, and there is no showing or claim that the evidence was insufficient to support those findings. that an additional term was not imposed on the enhancements does not change the fact that the amount of mes exceeded 100 liters by volume (health & saf. code,  11370.4). (see people v. quinones (2014) 228 cal.app.4th 1040 [defendant found guilty of arming allegation but sentencing court declined to impose sentence on it; defendant ineligible for resentencing].) that he had to be sentenced on the weight enhancements in order for them to disqualify him from resentencingcontravenes its intent to limit eligibility for resentencing to third strikers support that he was, in fact, armed as opposed to somehow being in constructive 4 it is unclear why byers was not sentenced on the weight enhancements. the sentencing court neglected to mention the enhancements at the sentencing hearing. 5 whose current offense is nonserious, nonviolent and who have not committed specified current and prior offenses, such as certain drug, sex, and gun-related felonies. (see generally people v. osuna (2014) 225 cal.app.4th 1020, 1036-1038.) byers is not eligible for resentencing on counts 1 and 12. disposition the order is affirmed as to counts 1 and 12. the order is reversed and remanded with the direction to the trial court to reconsider eligibility for resentencing as to counts 8, 9, 13, 18, 19 and 20. not to be published in the official reports aldrich, j. we concur: edmon, p. j. lavin, j.
