(pen. code,  646.9, subd. (a), 422, 166, subd. (a)(4).) the trial court sentenced gonzalez to prison and ordered him to pay, inter alia, a $20 dna penalty assessment pursuant to government code section 76104.7. we order the judgment modified to strike the penalty assessment and, as so modified, affirm. discussion1 at sentencing, the trial court ordered gonzalez to pay a $240 court security assessment (pen. code,  1465.8, subd. (a)(1)), a $180 criminal conviction assessment (gov. code,  70373), a $1,000 restitution fine (pen. code,  1202.4, subd. (b)), a $1,000 parole revocation fine (pen. code,  1202.45), and a $20 dna penalty assessment (gov. code,  76104.7). gonzalez contends the $20 penalty assessment imposed pursuant to government code section 76104.7 does not apply to any of the other fines imposed in this case. (see people v. allen (2001) 88 cal.app.4th 986, 991.) consequently, it must be stricken an as unauthorized sentence. (people v. scott (1994) 9 cal.4th 331, 354.) the people concede the point and it appears their concession is well taken. a dna fine under government code section 76104.7 must be attached as a penalty assessment to some other properly imposed fine, generally a dna fine under government code section 76104.6. (see people v. valencia (2008) 166 cal.app.4th 1392, 1395.) no such fine was imposed in this case. accordingly, the $20 dna fine must be stricken as unauthorized. 1 the facts of the underlying offenses are unnecessary to resolve the issue presented. 3 disposition the judgment is modified to strike the imposition of a $20 dna fine pursuant to government code section 76104.7. in all other respects, the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports klein, p. j. we concur: croskey, j. kitching, j.
