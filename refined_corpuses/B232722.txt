(pen. code,  487.) we agree that the amendment operates retroactively. because the evidence does not show that petty theft. in all other respects, we affirm the judgment. facts bonnie johnston and her husband own 60 acres on 60th street east in lancaster. -up house where they lived until it was irreparably damaged by a flood. they now live in a new home on their land. since the flood, the johnstons use their old home and a nearby machine shed to store furniture, tools and farm implements. -quarter of a mile away (the passenger) got out and opened up mail boxes. this was the tenth time angeles had seen the van. one day earlier, angeles saw appellant and another man loading metal -up house. angeles chased the van as it drove away and confronted its occupants: appellant denied stealing mail, and maintained that the notified the johnstons about the activities he witnessed. the johnstons, who were on vacation, curtailed their trip and returned home. they observed that the bathroom window of the old house was unboarded and broken; it was intact when they left on vacation. mrs. johnston called the shreported that a stereo cabinet worth $100 was missing from the old house. missing from the machine shed were a tool box; a cabinet containing welding rods; a metal chain and hook for a motor hoist; a tiered lazy susan containing pipe fittings; railroad ties; and 3 about 25 sheets of corrugated steel. the johnstons do not know appellant and did not give him permission to enter their property or take items from it. angeles was asked in court about the value of the stolen items. he testified that railroad ties are worth $20 to $40 each, and sheet metal is worth $20 to $40 per sheet, depending on size. defense counsel objected that this testimony lacked foundation. property. on march 23, 2010, bishop traced the license plate number recorded by angeles to a white van parked at a residence in lancaster. appellant was at the residence. he told bishop that he and a man named reagan used the van on march 19, in about $80 for the recycled items. bishop conducted a photographic lineup with the ppellant appellant testified in his own defense. he stated that he went scrapping with an acqon the east side of the antelope valley, but is not sure if it was 60th street east. he picked up some sheet metal that was buried in the dirt, not in a shed or building, and took it to a scrap yard. appellant received $25 as his share. he denied speaking to angeles. he told deputy bishop that he collected and sold scrap metal from the desert. procedural history appellant pleaded not guilty to charges of second degree commercial burglary and grand theft of personal property. (pen. code,  459, 487.) a jury convicted appellant of probation, on condition that he serve one year in county jail. discussion on january 1, 2011, an amendment to penal code section 487 took effect, altering the definition of grand theft. before the amendment, grand theft occurred if someone took property valued at more than $400. under the new law, the value of the purloined 4 property must exceed $950. the grand theft charges against appellant were filed on december 16, 2010, two weeks before the amendment took effect. appellant contends that he is entitled to benefit from the amendment, so that the prosecution had to prove he stole personal property worth more than $950. the attorney general agrees with appellant. the legislature may amend a criminal statute to diminish punishment when, in its (in re estrada legislative act mitigating the punishment for a particular criminal offense is intended to people v. brown (2012) 54 cal.4th 314, 324.) thus, the courts retroactively apply amendments that reduce punishment, absent indicia of a contrary legislative intent. (people v. nasalga (1996) 12 cal.4th 784, 793.) for example, an amendment increasing the dollar loss required for imposition of a sentence enhancement applies to cases in which the conviction is not final. (id. at p. 787.) an checks from $50 to $100. (in re kirk (1965) 63 cal.2d 761, 762-763.) does not apply to a pending criminal case. (people v. floyd (2003) 31 cal.4th 179, 182-183.) the 2010 amendment to penal code section 487 does not contain any indicia that the legislature intended its provisions to apply prospectively. as a result, the increased convicted and sentenced after the amendment took effect. the attorney general concedes the insufficiency of evidence showing that the value of the property appellant took from the johnstons exceeded $950. a theft that does fies people v. cuellar (2008) 165 cal.app.4th 833, 837.) essential to the commission of petty theft is that the stolen property have some intrinsic value, however small. (people v. cuellar, supra, 165 cal.app.4th at pp. 838- 5 accord: people v. caridis (1915) 29 cal.app. 166, 169 [stolen ticket for an illegal lottery had some slight intrinsic value as a piece of paper, sufficient to show petty larceny].) the property taken from the johnstonsa stereo cabinet, a tool box, a cabinet with welding rods, a motor hoist, a lazy susan, railroad ties, and corrugated steel sheetshad intrinsic value. indeed, appellant told the investigating officer that he received $80 from the sale of that property, and testified that his share was $25. an appellate court may modify a judgment to reduce the degree of an offense when there is insufficient evidence to support the higher offense. (pen. code,  1260; people v. navarro (2007) 40 cal.4th 668, 677-678; people v. bassett (1968) 69 cal.2d 122, 137-138.) specifically, if the evidence does not support a conviction for grand theft, the appellate court may reduce the offense to petty theft. (people v. simpson (1938) 26 cal.app.2d 223, 229-230.) there is sufficient evidence in this case to support a finding of petty theft. no resentencing is required because the sentence on count 2 was stayed pursuant to penal code section 654. disposition the judgment is modified to reflect a conviction for petty theft on count 2. in all other respects, the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. boren, p.j. we concur: ashmann-gerst, j. chavez, j.
