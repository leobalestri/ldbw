filed 7/29/16 p. v arreola ca2/1 not to be published in the official reports california rules of court, rule 8.1115(a), prohibits courts and parties from citing or relying on opinions not certified for publication or ordered published, except as specified by rule 8.1115(b). this opinion has not been certified for publication or ordered published for purposes of rule 8.1115. in the court of appeal of the state of california second appellate district division one the people, plaintiff and respondent, v. alfred arreola, defendant and appellant. b266354 (los angeles county super. ct. no. ka102324) appeal from a judgment of the superior court of los angeles county, george genesta, judge. appeal dismissed. paul kleven, under appointment by the court of appeal, for defendant and appellant. no appearance for plaintiff and respondent. ____________________________ 2 alfred arreola sexually abused his daughter over a period of 10 years beginning when she was six years old. he pleaded no contest to charges of continuous sexual abuse of a child under the age of 14 and sexual intercourse or sodomy with a child 10 years old or younger, and admitted a prior strike, in exchange for a 33-year prison sentence and dismissal of 11 other sexual abuse counts. (pen. code,  288.5, subd. (a), 288.7, subd. (a).) the trial court accepted this plea pursuant to people v. west (1970) 3 cal.3d 595 (defendant entitled to enter a no contest plea while maintaining protestation of innocence), sentenced arreola according to the plea agreement, and awarded him custody credit of 708 actual days plus 106 conduct days, for a total of 814 days, and required that he pay restitution and various fines, provide a dna sample, and register as a sex offender upon release from prison. on july 30, 2015, arreola thereafter requested a certificate of probable cause, which the trial court denied. he then appealed, challenging his sentence and other matters occurring after his plea. we appointed counsel to represent arreola on appeal and, after examination of the record, appointed counsel filed an opening brief raising no issues and asking this court to review the record independently. (people v. wende (1979) 25 cal.3d 436, 441-442.) on april 1, 2016, we sent letters to arreola and appointed counsel, directing counsel to forward the appellate record to arreola and advising arreola that within 30 days he could personally submit any contentions or issues he wished us to consider. arreola did not respond. no contest plea and failure to obtain a certificate of probable cause limit the scope of his appeal either to [g]rounds that arose after entry of the plea and do not affect the pleas or to the denial of a motion to suppress evidence under penal code section 1 (cal. rules of court, rule 8.304(b); see pen. code,  1237.5.) we have examined the entire record and find no such issue exists. we are therefore satisfied attorney complied with his responsibilities. (people v. wende, supra, 25 cal.3d at p. 441.) 3 disposition the appeal is dismissed. not to be published chaney, j. we concur: rothschild, p. j. johnson, j.
