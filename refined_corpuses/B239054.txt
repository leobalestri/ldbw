(a)) and admitted having suffered six prior serious or violent felony convictions within the meaning of the three strikes law ( 667, subds. (b)-(i), 1170.12, subds. (a)-(d)) and having served five separate prison terms for felonies ( 667.5, subd. (b)). on august 15, 2011, the trial court granted warrens motion to dismiss all but one of the prior strike convictions (people v. superior court (romero) (1996) 13 cal.4th 497, 531) and all of the prior prison term enhancements. the court then sentenced warren to an aggregate state prison term of six years (the three-year upper term doubled under the three strikes law). the court calculated warrens presentence custody credits according to a now superseded version of section 4019. that section, effective september 28, 2010, allowed prisoners in local custody to be deemed to have served six days for every four days of actual confinement. (former  4019, subds. (b), (c), (f) & (g); stats. 2010, ch. 426,  2, eff. sept. 28, 2010.) accordingly, warren was awarded 216 days of presentence custody credits (144 actual days and 72 days of conduct credits). warren was ordered to pay a $40 court security fee, a $30 criminal conviction assessment, a $50 lab fee, and a $200 restitution fine. the court imposed and suspended a parole revocation fine. ( 1202.45.) on january 27, 2012, warren filed a motion to modify his presentence custody credits based on an amendment to section 4019 that was expressly operative october 1, 2011 and allowed four days to be deemed served for every two days of actual confinement. ( 4019, subd. (f); stats. 2011, ch. 15  482, stats. 2011-2012, ch. 12,  35.) the trial court denied the motion. 1 all further statutory references are to the penal code. 3discussion warren asserts he is entitled to an additional 72 days of conduct credits based on the newly amended section 4019, even though he was sentenced prior to october 1, 2011. specifically, warren contends: (1) the amendment to section 4019 applies retroactively, and (2) the denial of the additional credits violates the equal protection clause. people v. brown (2012) 54 cal.4th 314 (brown) disposes of warrens claims. in brown, the california supreme court determined that an earlier version of section 4019 applied prospectively only, meaning that qualified prisoners in local custody first became eligible to earn credit for good behavior at the increased rate beginning on the statutes operative date. (id. at p. 318.) brown reasoned that statutory construction did not require retroactive application: the statute contains no express declaration that increased conduct credits are to be awarded retroactively, and no clear and unavoidable implication to that effect arises from the relevant extrinsic sources, i.e., the legislative history. (id. at p. 320.) brown also decided that prospective application of the earlier version of section 4019 did not violate the equal protection clauses of the federal and state constitutions. (u.s. const., 14th amend.; cal. const., art. i,  7, subd. (a).) [t]he important correctional purposes of a statute authorizing incentives for good behavior [citation] are not served by rewarding prisoners who served time before the incentives took effect and thus could not have modified their behavior in response. that prisoners who served time before and after former section 4019 took effect are not similarly situated necessarily follows. (people v. brown, supra, 54 cal.4th at pp. 328-329.) we see no reason the rationale of brown should not apply with equal force to the newly amended section 4019. (see people v. lara (2012) 54 cal.4th 896, 906, fn. 9.) warrens crime was committed on march 8, 2011, and he was sentenced on august 15, 2011, well before the amendments effective date of october 1, 2011. accordingly, we reject warrens claim he is entitled to additional presentence custody credits by reason of retroactive application of the latest amendment to section 4019. 4disposition the order is affirmed. woods, acting p. j. we concur: zelon, j. jackson, j.
