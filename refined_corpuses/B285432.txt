(see people v. jimenez, review granted july 25, 2018, s249397; people v. sanders, review granted july 25, 2018, s248775; people v. brayton, review granted oct. 10, 2018, s251122.) the court identified the issue presented in jimenez unauthorized use of personal identifying information of another (pen. code,  530.5, subd.

(sanders, supra, 22 cal.app.5th at pp. 480-481.) by contrast, on may 8 of this year, division six of this court reduce his convictions for identity theft to misdemeanors. in people v. jimenez (2018) 22 cal.app.5th 1282, review granted july 25, 2018, s249397 (jimenez), the defendant had cashed two apparently forged checks at a check-cashing business. the amounts of the checks were roughly $632 and $597. (id. at p. 1285.) 14 sanders also was convicted of two counts of commercial burglary. the trial court granted her petition for resentencing under proposition 47 on those counts.

(id. at p. 146.) on the one count relevant to our inquiry, the jury had convicted liu of violating section 530.5, subdivision (c)(3), the fraudulent acquisition and retention of the personal identifying information resentencing on that count.

(liu, supra, 21 cal.app.5th at p. 146.) id. at p. 150.) the court distinguished romanowski16 access card information as grand theft contrast, section 530.5 does not define its crimes as grand theft, liu, at p. 151.) the [s]ection 530.5 addresses harms much broader than theft. (id. at p. 152.) the meaning of proposition 47, given the far-reaching effects of id. at p. 153.)15 pending further guidance from our supreme court, we of section 459.5, a violation of section 530.5(a) is more accurately termed (calcrim no. 2040; see people v. truong (2017) 10 cal.app.5th 551, 561 (truong) ; d that information ; 15 as noted, the supreme court granted review of liu in june 2018 (s248130). the court stated the issue presented as theft of access card information in violation of penal code section 484e, subdivision (d), is eligible to be reduced to a misdemeanor under proposition 47 when the information has been used to obtain property, is the value of the access card information limited to the fair market value of the information itself on the black market or can the value of the property obtained by the use of the information be considered? (see people v. romanowski 17 information without the consent of the person whose identifying calcrim no. 2040.) our supreme court has held that some conduct in violation of a particular statute may qualify for resentencing while other conduct may not. for example, in people v. page (2017) 3 cal.5th 1175, the court held that taking a vehicle in violation of vehicle code section 10851 is reducible while driving a vehicle in violation of that same statute is not. similarly, there are a variety of acts that can constitute a violation of penal code section 530.5(a). as the gonzales court held, where a defendant steals, forges, and cashes checks (for $950 or less), that conduct amounts to shoplifting. (gonzales, supra, 2 cal.5th at p. 862.) what salha did here is very different. he perpetrated a sophisticated skimming scheme that went far beyond entering a merchandise from a store. as the liu court noted, [s]ection (liu, supra, 21 cal.app.5th at p. 152.) the legislature put section 530.5 in the (truong, supra, 10 cal.app.5th at p. 561.) the statute is intended fraud, who cannot protect themselves from fraudulent use of their identifying information once it is in the possession of another, because they cannot easily change their name, date of birth, social security people v. valenzuela (2012) 205 cal.app.4th 800, 807.) indeed, the drafters of proposition 47 and the voters who approved it were sufficiently concerned about identity theft in violation of section 530.5(a) that the proposition contains an express provision that a person convicted of both forgery and identity theft shall not be entitled to resentencing on the forgery count. (see people v. gonzales (2018) 6 cal.5th 44, 46 [quoting section 473(b)].) 18 in short, had in mind when they passed proposition 47. (cf. people v. martin (2018) 26 cal.app.5th 825, 828 that the electorate intended that a person, such as [respondent martin] . . . who joined an international conspiracy to commit petty theft, would deserve misdemeanor treatment. 3. a felony conviction for a violation of penal code section 484e(d) qualifies for resentencing if the applicant carries his burden of proving the market value of the stolen access card information was $950 or less as noted, salha pleaded to and was convicted of one count of violating section 484e(d), theft of access card account information. under romanowski, salha is entitled to a reduction of that conviction to a misdemeanor if he carries his burden of proving the value of the stolen access card information was $950 or less. (romanowski, supra, 2 cal.5th at pp. 916-917.) section 484e(d) conviction on the ground that the bank atm was was error. section 459.5 retail commercial establishment. ( 459.5, subd. (a).)16 as we have discussed, gonzales involved a bank. (gonzales, supra, 2 cal.5th at p. 862.) in gonzales, the supreme 16 people v. franske (2018) 28 cal.app.5th 955 [transportation company that sold motor homes]; people v. holm (2016) 3 cal.app.5th 141 [private golf and country club]; people v. vargas (jan. 19, 2016, b262129) [nonpub. opn.] [check-cashing business]. 19 (id. at p. 873, italics omitted.) the court stated, colloquial sense. further, if the electorate had intended to limit the shoplifting statute to an entry with intent to steal retail merchandise, it could have done so by using language similar to id. at pp. 873-874. see also people v. abarca (2016) 2 cal.app.5th 475, 481-establishmpeople v. osotonu (2018) 26 cal.app.5th 973, review granted dec. 12, 2018, s251817 [24- g$950. if the record supported this conclusion, we would affirm. but on the limited and spotty record before us, the facts are quite unclear. the police report lists the victim as bank of america in glendora. but the information filed against salha lists the victim as chase bank in the section 530.5 counts. as we have said, those counts are not eligible for resentencing. in the one count (count 7) that is eligible, the people have not listed any victim. moreover, the police report lists the amount of the loss as as noted, the police report says officers found $618 in cash trunk of the nissan. the report does not mention whether police found any identifying information in the duffel bag for either salha or his passenger and co-arrestee georgiev. officers also found eight 20 addresses for six chase bank branches. are we to conclude all of the in the duffel bag came from chase branches that salha and georgiev already had hit up? we have only the december 1, 2010 incident reportno preliminary hearing transcript, no follow-up police reports. (at the end of the december 1 police report, officer follow-submit b) nor did salha submit a declaration swearing to the source of the cash found in his wallet and in the car he was driving. by filing his application for resentencing on the los was not more than $950, and submitting the police report, salha made out a prima facie case entitling him to an evidentiary hearing. (washington, supra, 23 cal.app.5th at p. 957.) we remand for that hearing. salha bears the burden of proving that the value of the access card account information he took in violation of section 484e(d) did not exceed $950.
