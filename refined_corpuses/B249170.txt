(pen. code,  1170.126). his appointed counsel filed a wende brief. (people v. wende (1979) 25 cal.3d 436.) on september 6, 2013, we directed counsel to send the record and a copy of brief to appellant and notified appellant of his right to respond within 30 days. no response has been received. in 1995, appellant was convicted of possession and transportation of cocaine for sale (health & saf. code,  11351, 11352, subd. (a)), conspiracy to possess and transport cocaine for sale (pen. code,  182, subd. (a)(1)), and false compartment activity (health & saf. code,  11366.8, subd.

(see  1170.126, subd. (b).) one of the eligibility conditions for fenses listed in penal code section 667, subdivision (e)(2)(c)(i)-(iii). (pen.code,  1170.126, 3 subd.
