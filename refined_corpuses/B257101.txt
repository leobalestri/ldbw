(b)-(d), 1170.12, subd. (a)). the trial court sentenced logan as a third strike offender to an indeterminate state prison term of 25 years to life. on september 13, 2013, logan filed a petition for recall of sentence under the three strikes reform act of 2012 (proposition 36). ( 1170.126.)2 on june 5, 2014, the trial court granted the petition and resentenced logan to a state prison term of six years (double the three-year upper term) for second degree burglary. the court calculated logans total custody credits as 6,174 days (6,117 actual days and 57 days local conduct credits). over logans objection, the court ordered him released subject to prcs. logan timely appealed. 1 statutory references are to the penal code. 2 in november 2012, california voters passed proposition 36, which allows inmates serving an indeterminate life sentence imposed upon conviction of a felony or felonies not defined as serious or violent for purposes of the three strikes law to file a petition for recall of sentence and request resentencing. (see  1170.126, subd. (b).) one of the eligibility conditions for resentencing is the inmates current sentence was not imposed for any of the offenses listed in section 667, subdivision (e)(2)(c)(i)-(iii). ( 1170.126, subd. (e)(2).) logans current sentence was imposed for second degree burglary, which is not one of the listed offenses. accordingly, he was eligible for resentencing to double the base term. ( 667, subds. (e)(1), (e)(2)(a), (e)(2)(c), 1170.12, subds. (c)(1), (c)(2)(a), (c)(2)(c).) 3discussion the postrelease community supervision act of 2011 (the act) ( 3450 et seq.) significantly changed the supervision of certain inmates upon release from state prison. these inmates would no longer be supervised by the state parole system. instead, their postrelease supervision would be transferred to county agencies using enhanced supervision strategies, evidence-based practices, and community-based punishment. ( 3450, subd. (b)(5).) the legislatures stated purpose for prcs was to reinvest californias criminal justice resources to improve public safety. (see  3450, subd. (b)(4).) prcs does not shorten the imposed prison term; it merely changes the agency that will supervise the inmate after release. section 3451, subdivision (a), specifies that any term of prcs shall be for a period not exceeding three years. prior to the effective date of the act, logan would have been released from prison on parole, and any excess custody credits (credits in excess of his prison term) would have been deducted from his term of parole. (see  2900.5, subd. (c); in re sosa (1980) 102 cal.app.3d 1002.) logan argues because prcs is analogous to parole, the trial court erred by not deducting his excess custody credits from prcs, as the court would have done from the term of parole. according to logan, had his excess custody credits been properly deducted, he would have been exempt from prcs because the number of custody credits he had earned prior to resentencing more than covered the three-year period. the trial court did not err in ordering logan to participate in prcs. participation in prcs is mandatory for any inmate resentenced under section 1170.126 and released from custody. custody credits cannot reduce the mandatory prcs supervision period. (people v. espinoza (2014) 226 cal.app.4th 635, 639-640.) in espinoza, a third-strike defendants petition for recall of sentence under section 1170.126 was granted, and he was resentenced as a second strike offender to a determinate prison term. (espinoza, at pp. 637-638.) although the defendants custody credits exceeded the term of his new sentence, he was ordered by the trial court to participate in prcs. (id. at p. 638.) the defendant appealed, arguing prcs was the functional equivalent of parole, and his 4excess custody credits should be subtracted from the term of prcs as they are from the term of parole. (id. at p. 639.) our colleagues in division six of this court concluded prcs and parole are two separate forms of supervision, noting [u]nlike parole, a felon participating in prcs cannot be returned to prison for violation of his or her postrelease supervision agreement ( 3458.) nor does the department of corrections and rehabilitation have jurisdiction over persons subject to postrelease community supervision. ( 3457.) (ibid.) the court explained that even if the defendant were entitled to custody credits, he was never paroled, having instead been resentenced under a new scheme requiring prcs. (espinoza, supra, 226 cal.app.4th at pp. 639-640.) logan acknowledges espinoza, but contends this case was wrongly decided and should not be followed. we disagree and follow the reasoning of our division six colleagues. disposition the order is affirmed. iwasaki, j. * we concur: perluss, p. j. zelon, j. * judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
