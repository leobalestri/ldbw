(a)); (2) possession for sale of a controlled substance (id.,  11351); (3) transportation of marijuana (id.,  11360, subd. (a)); and (4) possession of marijuana for sale (id.,  11359). on august 19, 2008, garcia pled no contest to the first count (transportation of a controlled substance), and the other counts were dismissed pursuant to a plea negotiation. garcia was assisted by the services of a spanish language interpreter. during the change of plea colloquy, the prosecutor advised this offense will result in a denial of citizenship, deportation, denial of reentry into the united states, and a denial of the terms and conditions of . . . the consequences of 3 y1 the court imposed and suspended a four-year sentence and placed garcia on three years formal probation.2 on march 14, 2011, the trial court terminated garprobation early and penal code section 1203.4. on december 4, 2013, the united states department of homeland security commenced proceedings to remove garcia from the united states as a result of her conviction. on july 8, 2014, garcia moved to set aside her conviction and withdraw her no contest plea based on ineffective assistance 1 the minute order from the change of plea confirms the section 1016.5 advisement was given and quotes the statutory a different version of what was said during the plea colloquy. under these circumstances, and especially given that both transcaccurate version of what was stated during the plea colloquy.

(people v. limon (2009) 179 cal.app.4th 1514, 1518.) 3 during the hearing, counsel for garcia referred to the correctly by the court, and we are not 5 b. standards governing section 1016.5 motions we begin with the statute. section 1016.5, subdivision (a), contendere to any offense punishable as a crime under state law, except offenses designated as infractions under state law, the court shall administer the following advisement on the record to the defendant: [] if you are not a citizen, you are hereby advised that conviction of the offense for which you have been charged may have the consequences of deportation, exclusion from admission to the united states, or denial of naturalization when the trial court [the] defendants motion, shall vacate the judgment and permit the defendant to withdraw the plea of guilty or nolo contendere, and ( 1016.5, subd. (b).) to prevail on a motion to vacate under section 1016.5, a defendant must establish that (1) he or she was not properly advised of the immigration consequences as provided by the statute; (2) there exists, at the time of the motion, more than a remote possibility that the conviction will have one or more of the specified adverse immigration consequences; and (3) he or she was prejudiced by the nonadvisement. (people v. totari (2002) 28 cal.4th 876, 884; accord, people v. arriaga (2014) 58 cal.4th 950, 957-958; zamudio, supra, 23 cal.4th at pp. 192, 199-200; people v. akhile (2008) 167 cal.app.4th 558, 562; people v. dubon (2001) 90 cal.app.4th 944, 951-952.) the underlying purpose of section 1016.5 is to ensure the defendant has actual knowledge of the possible adverse immigration consequences of a guilty or no contest plea and has had an opportunity to make an intelligent 6 choice to plead guilty or no contest. (zamudio, at pp. 193-194; gutierrez, supra, 106 cal.app.4th at p. 173.) section 1016.5 requires the court to expressly warn ble immigration consequencesof their convictions before taking their pleas. (gutierrez, supra, 106 cal.app.4th at p. 173.) although section 1016.5, subdivision (a), specifically defines those consequences as substantial compliance is required under section 1016.5 as long as the defendant is specifically advised of (gutierrez, at p. 174.) the advisement may be given by the judge orally, by counsel orally or through a colloquy eliciting that the defendant was advised of these consequences in a written plea form. (people v. quesada (1991) 230 cal.app.3d 525, 536 [so long as the legislative purpose is advanced by having some person acting on behalf of the tribunal actually advise [the] defendant of the immigration consequences of his plea and that advice is reflected on the record, the actual adviser is immaterial].) the (people v. akhile, supra, 167 cal.app.4th at p. 564.) c. the immigration advisement substantially complied with the statute garcia contends she was not advised that her plea of no ( 1016.5, subd. (a).) garcia is correct that the prosecutor 7 language did not mirror the language of the statute. the prosecutor did not to the denial of naturalization. instead, the prosecutor advised garcia that her plea would have the consequences of d while factual observation is correct that the language did not track the statute verbatim, her legal point that the section 1016.5 motion should have been granted is not. (see gutierrez, supra, 106 cal.app.4th at p. 173.) 1. exclusion from admission garcia argues the statutory 1016.5, subd. (a)) encompasses both denial of reentry, for a person outside the united states, and denial of lawful admission, for a person already inside this country. garcia claims her tps status constitutes a form of lawful admission to the united states. garcia contends that by nd the prosecutor failed to advise her regarding the potential loss of her tps status and the potential loss of her ability to adjust her status through her united states citizen children. garcia argues that because the court failed to advise her concerning exclusion from admission, she was unaware her plea might affect her tps status and might result in her deportation. the fact she was specifically advised concerning deportation and denial of reentry, however, belies this contention. the statute does not require the trial court to advise garcia concerning any 8 particular preliminary event such as the possible loss of her tps status or loss of adjustment related to her citizen children.4 the advisement that her plea could result in deportation and denial of reentry into the united states substantially complied with the statute and adequately informed garcia of the immigration consequences from her plea. moreover, the exact same phrase used during the plea colloquy in this case was specifically reviewed and discussed in gutierrez. as in our case, the prosecutor in gutierrez advised the defendant he would be - as a result of his plea, rather than telling the defendant he would be excluded from admission. (gutierrez, supra, 106 cal.app.4th at p. 171.) after examining the law and the definitions of the operative terms, the gutierrez court found denied re-. (id. at p. 174, fn. 4.) the court of 4 regardless of which language was included in the garcia specifically that a consequence of her plea must have been the loss of her tps status. the court providing a section 1016.5 advisement is not required to examine the constellation of immigration issues and give specific advice. (see gutierrez, supra court does not have an obligation to advise on those immigration consequences that appellant may suffer other than the ones listed in [] (see padilla v. kentucky (2010) 559 u.s. 356 [130 s.ct. 1473, 176 of counsel was previously denied by the trial court and not appealed. 9 appeal wrote: [the defendant] was expressly told that one of the immigration consequences of his conviction was that he would be denied reentry into the united states; in other words, under the statute he would be excluded from the united states. the trial court, thus, substantially complied with the statute, and hence, committed no error in the manner in which it took [the id. at p. 174.) the same is true here. garcia contends gutierrez is not controlling because the defendant in gutierrez, following his deportation, attempted to reenter the country. the advisement the defendant received concerning denial of reentry, therefore, was adequate to advise him of the consequence he suffered. but the same is true here. garcia was adequately advised she would be deported and denied reentry. these are the immigration consequences she is facing and for which she seeks relief. similarly, the california supreme court in zamudio noted that, even in the absence of an advisement concerning exclusion from admission, if the advisement concerning deportation and naturalization would have informed the defendant of the only consequences pertinent to his or her situation, such an advisement would be in substantial compliance with the requirements of section 1016.5. (zamudio, supra, 23 cal.4th at p. 208.) as stated, the pertinent consequences facing garcia are deportation and denial of reentry. as such, the advisement given substantially complied with the statutory requirements under section 1016.5. 2. denial of naturalization garcia also argues that by advising her of the consequence d]enial of citizenship 10 d]enial of naturalization the trial court and the prosecutor failed to properly advise her. according to garcia, the process of process of applying for citizenship that there was no basis for finding substantial compliance. erson becomes a naturalized citizen of the united states. (8 u.s.c.  1421, 1422.) the california supreme court in zamudio n]aturalizationalien, through petition to appropriate authorities, can become a c(zamudio, supra, 23 cal.4th at p. 208.) here, garcia was specifically advised that as a result of her plea she would be denied citizenship. the advisement substantially complied with the statutory requirement regarding 11 disposition the order is affirmed. bensinger, j.* we concur: zelon, acting p. j. segal, j. * judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
