(smith v. robbins (2000) 528 u.s. 259, 278; people v. kelly (2006) 40 cal.4th 106, 110; wende, supra, 25 cal.3d at p. 443.) defendant admitted his strike, and the record reflects that the court considered and implicitly denied his request that the strike be stricken pursuant to people v. superior court (romero) (1996) 13 cal.4th 497. the court acted well within its discretion in declining to strike the strike. (romero, supra, 13 cal.4th at pp. 530-531; people v. carmony (2004) 33 cal.4th 367, 375-376.) only abuse its discretion in failing to strike a prior felony conviction allegation in limited recognize its discretion, considers impermissible factors, or imposes a sentence that is arbitrary, capricious, or patently absurd on the facts of the case. (people v. carmony, supra, 33 cal.4th at p. 378.) there is no indication that the court engaged in any of these or other verboten behaviors. to the contrary, the concerned the nature and circumstances prospectsall of which are proper considerations. (see people v. williams (1998) 17 cal.4th 148, 161.) it is also proper for a court to consider the remoteness of the prior conviction, but the court need not give that factor substantial weight where, as here, the reco-people v. humphrey (1997) 58 cal.app.4th 809, 813) but rather the commission of the instant crimes while defendant remained on parole for his previous strike conviction. although our review of the record revealed no arguable bases for reversal, it did reveal an error in the abstract of judgment. of conviction; it does not control if different from the trial court's oral judgment and may not ad (people v. mitchell (2001) 26 cal.4th 181, 185.) at any time, and appellate courts (including this one) that have properly assumed jurisdiibid.), may order correction of an abstract of judgment that does not accurately reflect the oral pronouncement of sentence (id. at pp. 185-188). the 6 abstract of judgment in this case is inaccurate. it states that defendant was convicted of violating section 2900, subdivision (a)(1) rather than section 29900, section (a)(1). we therefore direct the court to correct the abstract of judgment and forward a copy of the corrected abstract to the department of corrections and rehabilitation. disposition the judgment is affirmed. the matter is remanded to the trial court with directions to prepare an amended abstract of judgment reflecting a conviction under penal code section 29900, subdivision (a)(1), rather than penal code section 2900, subdivision (a)(1), and to forward a certified copy of the amended abstract of judgment to the department of corrections and rehabilitation. not to be published in the official reports collins, j. we concur: epstein, p. j. willhite, j.
