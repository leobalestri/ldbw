(in re george thomas (mar. 29, 2013, b245966 [nonpub. order].) defendant was convicted after a retrial. at the first trial, defendant was represented by wayne redmond. at the retrial, defendant was represented by michael morse. defeconstitutionally ineffective because they never raised a prosecutorial vindictiveness issue. the writ petition alleges that mr. redmond and mr. morse should have sought dismissal of one of the prior violent or serious felony conviction allegations. defendant reasoned the prosecutor, jason quirino, realleged a prior serious and violent conviction allegation 1 except where otherwise noted, future statutory references are to the penal code. 3 after the first retrial ended in a mistrial without any rational justification. after issuance of our order to show cause, the prosecutor failed to file a return. no justification was parties entered into a stipulation to strike a prior serous and violent conviction. on may the people make a motion to strike one of [the] strike priors for mr. thomas, making this a second-strike case. [] we would then ask for a new sentencing date in the future. [] and both parties also ask that the court not make any factual findings on the current writ before the court, because the parties have agreed by stipulation to resolve the matter by the trial court accepted the stipulation. on july 1, 2013, the trial resentenced defendant. this appeal followed. we express no opinion as to: whether mr. redmond or mr. morse acted ineffectively; mr. quirino engaged in misconduct; or whether it was appropriate to accept the stipulation without requiring filing of the return as we ordered. iii. discussion a. orders under review concerning custody credits upon resentencing, the trial court awarded defendant credit for 497 days in presentence custody plus 248 days of conduct credit for a total of 745 days. the sole issue raised by defendant is whether he is additionally entitled to credit for his actual days in custody from the initial sentencing through the resentencing. we reject the attorney s appeal must be dismissed under section 1237.1. we modify the judgment to award defendant the additional custody credit. 4 b. section 1237.1 does not require dismissal of this appeal nder section 1237.1. there is no constitutional right to appeal.

(people v. delgado, supra, 210 cal.app.4th at p. 765.) here, the issue on appeal is not whether custody credits were miscalculated or there was clerical error. the question is whether under people v. buckhalter (2001) 26 cal.4th 20, 23-41, defendant is entitled to additional custody credit. section 1237.1 does not require dismissal of the present appeal. (people v. delgado, supra, 210 cal.app.4th at pp. 764-767.) c. defendant is entitled to additional custody credit defendant was initially sentenced on july 25, 2011. he was resentenced on july 1, 2013. defendant should have been credited with the 707 days served in prison between july 25, 2011, when he was originally sentenced, and july 1, 2013, when he was resentenced.

(a)) a five-year sentence on count 2. the trial court should have imposed a 10-year sentence pursuant to sections 667, subdivision (e)(1) and 1170.12, subdivision (c)(1). once doubled, the 10-year sentence was properly stayed. (people v. thomas, supra, typed opn. at p. 24; see people v. dominguez (1995) 38 cal.app.4th 410, 420 & fn. 7, 424 [once the doubled term was imposed, it was properly stayed].) e. criminal laboratory analysis fee in the prior appeal, we held defendant was subject to a $50 criminal laboratory analysis fee (health & saf. code,  11372.5, subd.
