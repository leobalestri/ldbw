(b)-(i), 1170.12, subds. (a)-(d)), and one prior conviction for which he served a prison term ( 667.5, subd. (b)). a jury convicted rivera of second degree robbery. he waived a jury trial on the prior conviction allegations, and the trial court found them to be true. but the court granted riveramotion under people v. superior court (romero) (1996) 13 cal.4th 497 to strike the prior convictions for purposes of the three strikes law ( 667, subd. (d), 1170.12, subd. (b)). 1 all further statutory references are to the penal code. 3 the trial court sentenced rivera to the middle term of three years for the robbery conviction. it imposed three five-year enhancements for the three prior serious felony convictions under section 667, subdivision (a)(1), and it stayed the enhancement under section 667.5, subdivision (b), for a total term of 18 years. on appeal, defendant contends the trial court erred in imposing three enhancements under section 667, subdivision (a)(1). the people concede the error, and we agree. discussion section 667, subdivision (a)(1), provides in pertinent part any person convicted of a serious felony who previously has been convicted of a serious felony in this state . . . shall receive, in addition to the sentence imposed by the court for the present offense, a five-year enhancement for each such prior conviction on charges brought and tried separatelyitalics added.) the underlying proceedings must have been formally distinct, in re harris (1989) 49 cal.3d 131, 136; accord, people v. jones (2015) 236 cal.app.4th 1411, 1415.) here, the abstract of judgment for the prior convictions shows a single case number, with all three convictions occurring on the same day. the people concede that because the three priors were charged together under the same case number and adjudicated in the same proceeding, the charges were not brought and tried separately. therefore, the trial court erred in imposing three enhancements under section 667, subdivision (a)(1). only one could be imposed. (harris, at p. 137.) 4 rivera asks us to direct the trial court to dismiss two of the three prior conviction allegations under section 667, subdivision (a)(1), and prepare a new abstract of judgment reflecting only one five-year enhancement. the people correctly respond, however, that [t]he proper remedy is not merely to strike two of the five-year enhancements, but to remand to the trial court so that it can the record reflects that r purposes of accordingly, we vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing. (see people v. rojas (1988) 206 cal.app.3d 795, 802.) disposition the judgment of conviction is affirmed. the sentence is vacated, and the case is remanded for resentencing. menetrez, j.* we concur: perluss, p. j. segal, j. * judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
