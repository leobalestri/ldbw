(a)), robbery (pen. code,  211), assault with a deadly weapon (a knife) (pen. code,  245, subd. (a)(1)) and misdemeanor vandalism (pen. code,  594, subd. (a)) against his sister, and robbery of ivan m., all as charged in an amended information. in a bifurcated proceeding espino admitted he had suffered one prior serious felony conviction (robbery) within the meaning of the three strikes law and penal code section 667, subdivision (a)(1). the people dismissed a penal code section 667.5, subdivision (b), one-year prior prison term enhancement in furtherance of justice. (pen. code,  1385, subd. (a).) the trial court sentenced espino to an aggregate state prison term of 19 years. espino timely appealed. discussion we appointed counsel to represent espino on appeal. after an examination of the record, counsel filed an opening brief in which no issues were raised. (people v. wende (1979) 25 cal.3d 3 436, 441-442.) on august 30, 2018 we advised espino he had 30 days within which to submit any contentions or issues he wished us to consider. we have received no response. at the time espino was sentenced, the court was required under section 667, subdivision (a), to enhance the sentence imposed for conviction of a serious felony by five years for each qualifying prior serious felony conviction. on september 30, 2018 the governor signed senate bill no. 1393, which, effective january 1, 2019, allows the trial court to exercise discretion to strike or dismiss section 667, subdivision (a), serious felony enhancements. (see stats. 2018, ch. 1013,  1 & 2.) following our review of the record, we requested supplemental letter attorney general addressing whether this court should remand espin to decide whether to exercise its new discretion to strike or dismiss the five-year serious felony enhancement. , as do we, that the new versions of penal code sections 667, subdivision (a), and 1385 apply to espino, whose sentence was not final before the effective date of the amended statutes. (people v. garcia matter of statutory construction, that the legislature intended senate bill 1393 to apply to all cases to which it could constitutionally be applied, that is, to all cases not yet final when senate bill ee people v. francis (1969) 71 cal.2d 66, 75-76 [legislature is presumed to intend amendments to penal code that give trial court discretion to impose a lower sentence to apply retroactively 4 to all nonfinal judgments]; in re estrada (1965) 63 cal.2d 740, 745.) however, the parties disagree on whether remand is appropriate. the attorney general argues that remand is people v. mcdaniels (2018) 22 cal.app.5th 420, 425, and people v. chavez (2018) 22 cal.app.5th 663, 713, and pointing imposition of the upper term sentence for the robbery of ivan m., acknowledgment of esrequest to dismiss his prior strike conviction for robbery under people v. superior court (romero) (1996) 13 cal.4th 497. although the attorney general is correct that trial court did not demonstrate leniency in the sentencing decisions it made, we cannot conclusively determine from the record that remand would be a futile act. (see people v. billingsley (2018) 22 cal.app.5th 1076, 1081 [d]efendants are entitled to sentencing decisions made in the exercise of the informed discretion of the sentencing court]; people v. mcdaniels, supra, 22 cal.app.5th at pp. 427-the trial court not to strike one or more of the firearm enhancements as to which new discretion to strike had been enacted].) 5 disposition and the matter remanded for the trial court to consider whether to strike the prior serious felony enhancement under penal code section 667, subdivision (a). perluss, p. j we concur: zelon, j. segal, j.
