( 1600.5.) at a hearing on august 10, 2011, flores informed the court, through counsel, that he planned to seek restoration of sanity pursuant to section 1026.2. flores waived jury trial, and the matter was tried to the court. the defense and the prosecution presented eight days of testimony, beginning on february 10, 2012, and ending on august 13, 1 all subsequent statutory references are to the penal code. 32012. on november 6, 2011, counsel presented closing arguments, and the court ruled that floress sanity is not restored at this time. the court ordered that floress outpatient placement continue. flores timely appealed and asked that counsel be appointed to represent him on appeal. appointed appellate counsel filed a brief describing the relevant course of proceedings and informing the court that he found no arguable issues to be pursued on appeal. we informed flores and invited him to submit, by brief or letter, any grounds of appeal, contentions, or arguments he wished this court to consider. he did not do so. the procedures of anders v. california (1967) 386 u.s. 738 and people v. wende (1979) 25 cal.3d 436 do not apply to an appeal from a denial of a petition to restore sanity pursuant to section 1026.2. (people v. dobson (2008) 161 cal.app.4th 1422, 1438.) we therefore dismiss the appeal. disposition the appeal is dismissed. not to be published. rothschild, j. we concur: mallano, p. j. chaney, j.
