(b)),3 kidnapping to commit carjacking ( 209.5) (count 2), and kidnapping to commit robbery ( 209, subd. (b)(1)) (count 3), each of which were committed for the benefit of a criminal street gang ( 186.22)).4 at resentencing proceedings held on march 25, 2011, the trial court sentenced cordova to 15 years to life in prison with a consecutive term of 10 years. although the total sentence will likely remain the same, we remand the matter to allow the trial court to impose the sentences as to counts 2 and 3 under the proper statutes, to correct the abstract of judgment and to forward a corrected copy of the abstract to the department of corrections. in all other respects, we affirm the judgment. 1 all further statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise indicated. 2 count 4 was ordered dismissed as it is a lesser included offense of count 2, kidnapping to commit carjacking. (see people v. cordova (july 29, 2008, b198305) [nonpub. opn.] (cordova i).) 3 provision of law, any person who, in the commission of a felony specified in subdivision (a), personally uses a firearm, shall be punished by an additional and consecutive term of imprisonment in the state prison for 10 years. the firearm need not be operable or loaded 4 section 186.22, subdivision (d), provides for time in county jail or prison when 3 factual and procedural background 1. facts.5 the sufficiency of the evidence is not in dispute. on april 13, 2005, cordova and two accomplices kidnapped bryan johnson to carjack and rob him. on april 14, 2005, cordova, who personally used a firearm during the offense, carjacked karen arakelian with the aid of three accomplices. cordova committed each of the crimes for the benefit of a criminal street gang. 2. procedural history. a. trial. cordova was tried by a jury which found her guilty of two counts of carjacking ( 215) (counts 1 & 4), with a finding as to count 1 that she personally used a firearm during the offense ( 12022.53, subd. (b)), kidnapping to commit carjacking ( 209.5) (count 2) and kidnapping to commit robbery ( 209, subd. (b)(1)) (count 3). in addition, the jury determined that each of the crimes had been committed for the benefit of a criminal street gang. ( 186.22.) the trial court sentenced cordova to a term of 30 years to life in prison. cordova appealed. b. cordova i. in an opinion filed on july 29, 2008 (cordova i), the appellate court considered a noted that the jury had found cordova guilty of kidnapping to commit carjacking (count 2) and carjacking (count 4). as the people conceded, carjacking is a lesser included offense of kidnapping to commit carjacking. under these circumstances, ed in count 4 should have been reversed and the appellate court remanded the matter to the trial court with directions to dismiss the count. 5 for a more complete statement of facts, see cordova i, supra, b198305. 4 the appellate court also noted that, for the carjacking alleged in count 1, the trial court had sentenced cordova to 30 years to life in prison. the sentence consisted of the five-year mid-during the offense ( 12022.53, subd. (b)) plus 15 years to life for the finding that she committed the crime for the benefit of a criminal street gang ( 186.22, subd. (b)(4)(b)).6 cordova claimed, and the people and appellate court agreed, that the trial court erred by imposing the five-year mid-nate alternate penalty for the underlying felony itself, when the jury has determined that the defendant has satisfied the conditions robert l. v. superior court (2003) 30 cal.4th 894, 900, fn. 6., italics in original.) it follows that, because section 186.22, subdivision (b)(4)(b) provides an alternate penalty, the trial court erred when it also imposed the five-year mid-term for the offense. with regard to counts 2 and 3, the jury found true the allegations the crimes were committed for the benefit of a criminal street gang pursuant to section 186.22, possibility of parole for the findings she kidnapped the victim during the commission of a carjacking as alleged in count 2 ( 209.5) and kidnapped the victim to commit robbery as alleged in count 3 ( 209, subd. (b)(1)). each sentence was run consecutively to the other and to the term imposed for count 1. however, on a later date, and without citation to 6 any person who is convicted of a felony enumerated in this paragraph committed for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with any criminal street gang, with the specific intent to promote, further, or assist in any criminal conduct by gang members, shall, upon conviction of that felony, be sentenced to an indeterminate term of life imprisonment with a minimum term of the indeterminate sentence calculated as the greater of : [] (a) the term determined by the court pursuant to section 1170 for the underlying conviction . . . . [] (b) imprisonment in the state prison for 15 years, if the felony is a home invasion robbery, in violation of subparagraph (a) of paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) of section 213; carjacking, as defined in section 215; a felony violation of section 5 statutory authority, the trial court stayed the life sentences. the appellate court vacated the sentences imposed for counts 2 and 3 and remanded the matter for resentencing as to those counts. finally, the appellate court noted that it was necessary to strike a $20 dna appeal rendered inapplicable the government code section which otherwise would have mandated such a charge. cordova i charge, [was] vacated, and the matter [was] remanded to the trial court with directions to dismiss count 4, and resentence appellant on the remaining counts consistent with [the dova appealed. c. cordova ii. people v. cordova (nov. 23, 2010, b217448) (cordova ii ), the trial court committed several errors when it resentenced cordova. the cordova ii court first determined that the trial court erroneously believed it lacked the discretion to impose concurrent sentences on counts 1 through 3. the appellate court recognized that in people v. rodriguez (2005) 130 statutory provision to the contrary, section 669 provides that a trial court shall impose either concurrent or rodriguez, the cordova ii court ncing consistent with that sentences, we had no occasion to reach the issue of whether a sentence on any count should have been imposed concurrently or consecutively, and cordova i contains no language directing the trial court to impose consecutive (or concurrent) sentences on any 6 any component thereof, should be or, in particular, as to cordova ii, supra, at p. 5.) cordova ii also addressed the abstract of judgment. the court initially indicated that, although it had directed the trial court to dismiss count 4, it had made no mention of section 654.7 count 4, carjacking, was to be dismissed because that offense amounted to a lesser included offense of count 2, kidnapping to commit carjacking. accordingly, the abstract of judgment was to be modified to delete any reference to section 654. in addition, as to count 1, the abstract of judgment indicated that the trial court imposed a section 186.22, subdivision (b)(4) enhancement of 10 years in prison (crime committed for the benefit of a gang) when the enhancement was actually imposed pursuant to section 12022.53, subdivision (b) (personal use of a firearm). as the abstract cordova ii court cordova ii, supra, b217448, at p. 6.) finally, the cordova ii sentence of 15 years to life as to each of counts 1 through 3 pursuant to . . . section cordova ii, supra, b217448, at p. 6.) d. proceedings held on march 25, 2011. opinion in cordova ii 7 section 654, subdivision (a), provides in relevant part thathat is punishable in different ways by different provisions of law shall be punished under the provision that provides for the longest potential term of imprisonment, but in no case shall the act or omission be punished under more 7 this court to resentence in accord with their counsel for cordova asserted that the sentences for counts 1, 2 and 3 should run concurrently, in part because cordova had wished to take an offer made by the the time this case went to trial, miss cordova had a 17-year offer . . . that she wanted to take, begged, pleaded numerous times, including at the caccept that deal. [] unfortunately for miss cordova, there was a co-defendant, and it was a package offer, and she was not permitted to take that deal and, as a result, was convicted of the charges . . . . [] so[,] consistent with her willingness to resolve the case early on but not being allowed to, i would ask the court to impose the [lowest] sentence that the court can, and i believe that that would be accomplished by running the prosecuconsecutive for that section . . . . [p]lus the gang allegations, [indicate] that there was a m the trial court indicated that it had presided over the trial and that the jury had when he was retried, the jury was again unable to reach a verdict. the trial court indicated it believed that, without the primary defendant, trial court pointed out th after weighing the various factors and indicating that it had carefully read the violation of . . . section 215 [(carjacking)], the sentence will be 15 years to life, pursuant to [section] 186.22[, subdivision] (b)(4)(b) [(gang allegation for carjacking)], and 8 pursuant to . . . section 12022.53[, subdivision] (b) [(use of a firearm)], ten years to run consecutively[,] [for a] [t]otal sentence [as to] count 1 [of] 15 years to life plus ten years. [] on count 2, . . . section 209.5 [(kidnapping to commit carjacking)], 15 years to life pursuant to [section] 186.22[, subdivision] (b)(4)(b). total sentence count 2, 15 years to life, to run concurrently to count 1. [] count 3, . . . section 209[, subdivision] (b), 15 years to life, pursuant to [section] 186.22[, subdivision] (b)(4)(b). total sentence [for] count 3, 15 years to life, and that would run concurrently to counts 1 and 2. [] count 4, . . . section 215 is dismissed as a lesser offense [of] count 2. total sentence, 15 the trial court ordered cordova to pay a $200 restitution fine ( 1202.4, subd. (b)), a suspended $200 parole revocation restitution fine ( 1202.45), and a $90 court security fee ( 1465.8, subd. (a)(1)). the court granted cordova presentence custody credit for 2,268 days. cordova filed a timely notice of appeal on may 6, 2011. contentions after examination of the record, on september 9, 2011, appointed counsel filed an opening brief which raised no issues and requested this court to conduct an independent review of the record. by notice filed september 9, 2011, and again on december 6, 2011, the clerk of this court advised cordova to submit within 30 days any contentions, grounds of appeal or arguments she wished this court to consider. in response, on december 6, 2011, cordova personally filed a document in which she simply asked for ha[s] one sister [who] takes care of [her] two crepresented by counsel. after independently reviewing the record and the sentencing statutes applied in this matter, on march 13, 2012, this court requested that the parties address the following 9 committed the offenses for the benefit of a criminal street gang within the meaning of . . . section 186.22 . . . , the trial court erred by imposing sentence as to those counts pursuant to . . 29, 2012. the people filed a reply on may 24, 2012. discussion subdivision (b)(5) of sectioparagraph (4), any person who violates this subdivision in the commission of a felony punishable by imprisonment in the state prison for life shall not be paroled until a minimum of 15 calendar years have been sernment in the state prison for life with the accordingly, as to counts 2 and 3, cordova should have been sentenced pursuant to section 186.22, subdivision (b)(5) rather than subdivision (b)(4)(b), which applies to carjacking. because the trial court sentenced cordova to a total term of 15 years to life, with a consecutive term of 10 years, a sentence proper under the facts of this case, the fact that it imposed sentences for two of the counts under the wrong statute makes little, if any, practical difference. however, although the resulting sentence will likely be the same, we remand for resentencing in part because subdivision (b)(5) of section 186.22 provides for punishment of icalendar years may be modified to properly reflect the sentence imposed. as we previously noted, the abstract of judg 10 disposition the judgment is affirmed, except that the sentences imposed with regard to counts 2 and 3 are vacated and the matter is remanded to the trial court to resentence appellant as to those counts consistent with this opinion. the trial court is then directed to forward to the department of corrections a corrected abstract of judgment properly reflecting the statutes under which the sentences as to counts 2 and 3 were imposed. not to be published in the official reports kitching, j. we concur: croskey, acting p.j. aldrich, j.
