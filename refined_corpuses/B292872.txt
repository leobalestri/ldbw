(a); count 2), and misdemelicense (veh. code,  12500, subd. (a); count 3). as to count 1, it was alleged that defendant had two prior vehicle-related felony convictions (pen. code,  666.5) and one prior prison term (pen. code,  667.5, subd. (b)). moreover, it was alleged that defendant was ineligible for probation because he had twice previously been convicted of a felony. (pen. code,  1203, subd. (e)(4).) the jury found defendant guilty on all counts. defendant admitted the prior conviction allegations. the trial court sentenced defendant to a total term of five years in county jail and imposed various assessments and a restitution fine. defendant raises two issues in this timely appeal. first, he argues that the trial court failed to instruct on the necessary elements of a felony violation of section 10851(a). second, he argues that the court violated due process by imposing assessments and restitution without first finding his ability to pay. ons allowed the jury to convict defendant of felony driving or taking a vehicle without consent in violation of section 10851(a) under a theft theory without proof that the vehicle was valued over $950. this was prejudicial error. accordingly, we reverse the conviction on count the people may retry count 1 as a felony or reduce it to a 3 challenge to the imposition of assessments and restitution not ripe for review. we affirm in all other respects. background a. relevant facts in april 2018, andres lopez (lopez) lent his 1998 honda cr-v to his cousin to drive to work. in the early morning hours to where he had parked the honda several hours earlier before starting a night shift in gardena. the car had been stolen. the theft was promptly reported to the police. at approximately 7:15 p.m. that evening, los angeles police department officer brandon roach and his partner were patrolling an area in south los angeles stolen and recovered stolen vehiclesthe honda being driven by defendant, ran a computer search of the license plate number, and learned that the car had been reported stolen earlier that day. defendant was pulled over and taken into custody without incident. officer roach searched the honda and observed that its was obviouscolumn was covered by a towel or cloth, possibly to avoid detection. a wrench, screwdrivers, pliers, and several shaved a slim jim device[,] which is ly a thin piece of metal generally with a hook on the end . . 4 b. relevant proceedings april 20, 2018, . . . the crime of driving or taking a vehicle without consent, in violation of . . . [section] 10851(a), a felony, was committed by [defendant] who did drive a vehicle, . . . without the consent of the owner, . . . and with the intent to deprive the o the trial court instructed the jury that a felony violation of section 10851(a) required proof of the following elements: a person took or drove a vehicle belonging to another person; [] 2. the other person had not consented to the taking or driving of his vehicle; and [] 3. when the person took or drove the vehicle, he had the specific intent to deprive the owner either permanently or temporarily of his title to or possession of the lics added.) during closing arguments, the prosecutor stated that the the driving aspect, that [defendant] was driving in a vehicle without the consent of the my only burden is to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that [defendant] was driving. did he dismantle the steering column or not? it had different kinds of indicia of theft in his car. he had the wrench which had keys attached, numerous different shaved keys. he had a shaved key in his pocket. he also had two se the jury returned a verdict finding defendant guilty of violating section 10851(a) by driving or taking a vehicle without consent. 5 discussion i. vehicle without consent must be reversed due to instructional error. defendant argues that the trial court failed to properly instruct the jury on count 1 and that the error was prejudicial because it allowed him to be convicted under an invalid legal theory. a. standard of review we review claims of instructional error de novo. (people v. mitchell (2019) 7 cal.5th 561, 579.) b. vehicle code section 10851, subdivision (a) temporarily or permanently deprive the owner of title or possession, can be violated by a range of conduct, only some of which constitutes theftpeople v. lara (2019) 6 cal.5th 1128, 1135 (lara).) a theft-based violation involves an unlawful taking, which people v. garza (2005) 35 cal.4th 866, 871.) this is distinguished from a with the intent to temporarily or permanently deprive the owner of title or posgive rise to a conviction under . . . section 10851 distinct from any people v. page (2017) 3 cal.5th 1175, 11881189.) 6 unlawfully driving or taking a vehicle in violation of section 10851(a) is an -misdemeanor[]lara, supra, 6 cal.5th at p. 1131)may be punished as either a felony or a misdemeanor. people v. gutierrez (2018) 20 cal.app.5th 847, 853 (gutierrez).) hile a theft-based violation . . . may be punished as a felony only if the vehicle is shown to have been worth over $950, a violation committed by posttheft driving may be charged lara, supra, at p. 1136; see also pen. code,  490.2, subd. (a).) c. analysis suffered from two errors. first, the court did not instruct the jury that, to convict defendant of a felony taking (i.e., theft), the people were required to prove that the value of the honda exceeded $950. (see gutierrez, supra, 20 cal.app.5th at p. 855; people v. jackson (2018) 26 cal.app.5th 371, 373 (jackson).) second, the court did not instruct the jury that, to convict defendant of felony posttheft driving, the people had to prove that there was a substantial break between the taking and the driving. (see lara, supra, 6 cal.5th at p. 1138.) thus, the . . failed to adequately distinguish among, and separately define the elements for, each (gutierrez, supra, 20 cal.app.5th at p. 856.) this failure permitted the jury to convict defendant on a theory of vehicle theft without finding that the requisite value of the vehicle had been proven. (see id. at p. 857; jackson, supra, 26 cal.app.5th at p. 378.) 7 the people do not dispute that instructional error occurred. rather, they contend that any error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.1 we disagree. one of which was legally correct and one legally incorrect, reversal is required unless there is a basis in the record to find (people v. chiu (2014) 59 cal.4th 155, 167.) under this standard, beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury based its verdict on the ibid.) that defendant committed posttheft driving. we cannot reach that conclusion here. during closing arguments, the prosecutor stated that the the driving aspectrecounted the indicia of theft 1 the people also argue that defendant forfeited his claim of error by failing to object to the instructions below. failing to object to an instruction or to request a modification generally forfeits a claim of instructional error on appeal. (see people v. lee (2011) 51 cal.4th 620, 638.) but this general rule does not preclude our review when the instruction affects the substantial rights of the defendant. (pen. code,  1259; gutierrez, supra, 20 cal.app.5th at p. 856, fn. 8.) here, the claimed errors involve the elements of a felony violation of section 10851(a). because s of a criminal offense people v. van winkle (1999) 75 cal.app.4th 133, 139), we decline to find forfeiture. (gutierrez, supra, at p. 856, fn. 8.) 8 (jackson, supra, 26 cal.app.5th at p. 380), constituted evidence that could have supported a conviction on a theft theory if a vehicle value of over $950 had also been proven. (see ibid.; people v. clifton (1985) 171 cal.app.3d 195, 199200.) the people liken this case to lara, where our supreme refer expressly to posttheft driving was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. (lara, supra, 6 cal.5th at p. 1138.) lara is distinguishable in several respects. first, unlike here where the jury also received a taking instruction, the jury in lara instructed only on an unlawful driving theory of the . . (id. at p. 1137, italics added; see also id. at p. 1132.) second, the defendant in lara ded driving the vehicle six or seven days after it was stolen from its owner, a time gap that id. at p. 1138.) here, defendant was stopped by police while driving the honda on the same day that it was reported stolen. third, in lara, there was neither defendant seven days after the theft. (ibid.) in contrast, defendant was in possession of the honda on the same day it was stolen and several tools that could have been used to effectuate the theftincluding shaved keys and a slim jim devicewere found either in for these reasons, we cannot conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that each member of the jury convicted defendant based on a posttheft driving theory, which did not require proof of the theft theory. we therefore must 9 elect whether to retry [defendant] on a felony [section 10851(a)] (jackson, supra, 26 cal.app.5th at p. 381; accord, gutierrez, supra, 20 cal.app.5th at p. 857.) assessments and restitution is not ripe for review. defendant argues that the trial court erred in imposing a $40 per count court operations assessment (pen. code,  1465.8), a $30 per count court facilities assessment (gov. code,  70373), a $10 crime prevention fine (pen. code,  1202.5), and a $300 restitution fine (pen. code,  1202.4) without first determining his ability to pay, in violation of his right to due process. however, because we are reversing the conviction on count 1, further proceedings, this argument is no longer ripe for our review. (see people v. garcia (2018) 30 cal.app.5th 316, 328 congealed to permit an intelligent and useful decision to be 10 disposition the conviction on count 1 is reversed. we affirm the its entirety and remand the matter to the trial court, where the people may retry count 1 as a felony or reduce it to a misdemeanor. not to be published in the official reports. _____________________, j. ashmann-gerst we concur: ________________________, p. j. lui ________________________, j. chavez
