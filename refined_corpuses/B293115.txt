(people v. arbuckle (1978) 22 cal.3d 749.) the trial court found the plea was freely and voluntarily made, and there was a factual basis for it. in accordance with the plea agreement, the trial court sentenced miranda to a term of five years eight months in prison and ordered her to pay victim restitution.3 the remaining 11 counts were dismissed. the court awarded miranda 32 days of custody credit and 32 days of conduct credit, for a total of 64 days. miranda filed a timely notice of appeal. as far as the record reflects, she did not obtain a certificate of probable cause. 3 the trial court originally imposed a restitution fine, a suspended parole revocation restitution fine, a court operations assessment, and a criminal conviction assessment. according to opening brief, subsequent to the original sentencing these fines and fees have been vacated pursuant to people v. dueas (2018) 30 cal.app.5th 1157. 4 discussion after review of the record, s court-appointed counsel filed an opening brief that raised no issues, and requested this court to conduct an independent review of the record pursuant to people v. wende (1979) 25 cal.3d 436. appellant was advised that she had 30 days to submit by brief or letter any contentions or argument she wished this court to consider. miranda has filed a supplemental brief. pursuant to section 1237.5 and california rules of court, rule 8.304(b), a criminal defendant who appeals following a plea of no contest or guilty, without a certificate of probable cause, may only challenge the denial of a motion to suppress evidence or raise grounds arising after the entry of the plea that do not affect people v. johnson (2009) 47 cal.4th 668, 676677; people v. french (2008) 43 cal.4th 36, 43.) with respect to sentencing or post-plea issues that do not in substance challenge the validity of the plea itself, we have examined the record and are satisfied no arguable issues exist and mirandaattorney has fully complied with the responsibilities of counsel. (people v. kelly (2006) 40 cal.4th 106, 126; people v. wende, supra, 25 cal.3d at pp. 441442.) in her supplemental brief, miranda complains that she asked her trial counsel to request from the trial court that she be given the opportunity to attend a drug rehabilitation program to address her methamphetamine addiction. such a program would also have assisted her in retaining custody of her children, but defense counsel failed to make such a request. she also argues that her sentence amounts to cruel and unusual punishment. convictions, and are not cognizable at this juncture absent a 5 certificate of probable cause. (cal. rules of court, rule 8.304(b);  1237.5.) a certificate of probable cause is required when a defendant claims that she received ineffective assistance of counsel prior to the plea (people v. stubbs (1998) 61 cal.app.4th 243, 244245), or that an agreed-upon sentence constitutes cruel and unusual punishment (people v. panizzon (1996) 13 cal.4th 68, 74, 78). but prior to entering her plea, miranda was advised of her rights and the consequences of the plea, including her rights to trial, to confront witnesses, and against self-incrimination. miranda indicated she understood, and waived, these rights, both orally and in writing. the record thus knowing, intelligent, and voluntary. (see people v. howard (1992) 1 cal.4th 1132, 1175; people v. mosby (2004) 33 cal.4th 353, 356 [proper advisement and waivers of constitutional rights in the record establish that a deadmission is voluntary].) that miranda pled because she was concerned about the possibility of a longer sentence does not indicate coercion or involuntariness. 6 disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports edmon, p. j. we concur: lavin, j. egerton, j.
