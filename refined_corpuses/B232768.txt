(jackson v. virginia (1979) 443 u.s. 307, 309; people v. elliot (2005) 37 cal.4th 453, 466; people v. bolin (1998) 18 cal.4th 297, 331; taylor v. stainer (9th cir. 1994) 31 f.3d 907, 908-909.) our supreme court has divided the criminal threat crime into five result in which may bface and under the circumstances in which it [was] made, . . . so unequivocal, unconditional, immediate, and specific as to convey to the person threatened, a gravity of people v. toledo (2001) 26 cal.4th 221, 227-228; accord, in re george t. (2004) 33 cal.4th 620, 630.) defendant argues there was insufficient evidence as to the second and fourth elements. defendant asserts the officers could not have taken his mere angry outburst seriously. defendant further asserts the deputies and detectives did not suffer sustained fear because the struggle to subdue him and secure the weapon lasted, at most, two minutes. and the surrounding circumstances. (people v. hamlin (2009) 170 cal.app.4th 1412, 1433; people v. butler (2000) 85 cal.app.4th 745, 753-754; people v. mendoza (1997) 59 cal.app.4th 1333, 1340-1341.) defendant, while armed, engaged in a violent struggle, resisting the authorities, and reaching for his gun, repeatedly and specifically he was in possession of a loaded weapon and that detective barragan had felt the gun on 6 (see, e.g., people v. toledo, supra, people v. fierro (2010) 180 people v. hamlin, supra, 170 cal.app.4th at pp. 1433-1434 s substantial intent that it be taken as a threat. there was substantial evidence the threat actually caused the officers to be in sustained fear for their safety. speople v. allen (1995) 33 cal.app.4th 1149, 1156.) however, division three of the court of opposites, we find that it means a period of time that extends beyond what is momentary, people v. allen, supra, 33 cal.app.4th at p. 1156; accord, people v. wilson (2010) 186 cal.app.4th 789, 808; people v. fierro, supra, 180 cal.app.4th at p. 1349; people v. solis (2001) 90 cal.app.4th 1002, 1024.) detectives barragan, delia and barry, as well as deputies springer and howell, each suffered intense fear during the 90 to 120 seconds of violent struggle. the requisite fear was sustained while defendant, who was armed and reaching for his weapon, repeatedly threatened to kill them. it was a highly charged situation. this was substantial evidence the officers were in sustained fear for their safety. (people v. fierro, supra, 180 cal.app.4th at p. 1349.) 7 b. during deliberations, the jury sought clarification of caljic nos. 2.02 (circumstantial evidence of specific intent)2 and 9.94 (criminal threats).3 the trial court asked the jury to be more specific. the jury subsequently ---- instruction 2.02 applies. is this the correc if the jury may be confusing a few of the legal concepts related to the crime of criminal 2 intent or mental state with which an act is done may be shown by the circumstances surrounding the commission of the act. however, you may not find the defendant guilty of the crime[s] charged in counts 1, 2, 3, 4 [criminal threats], and 7 [controlled substance possession], unless the proved circumstances are not only (1) consistent with the theory that the defendant had the required specific intent or mental state but (2) cannot be reconciled with any other rational conclusion. [] also, if the evidence as to any specific intent or mental state permits two reasonable interpretations, one of which points to the existence of the specific intent or mental state and the other to its absence, you must adopt that interpretation which points to its absence. if, on the other hand, one interpretation of the evidence as to the specific intent or mental state appears to you to be reasonable and the other interpretation to be unreasonable, you must accept the 3 and 5 of having violated section 422 of the penal code, a crime. [] every person who willfully threatens to commit a crime which will result in death or great bodily injury to another person, with the specific intent that the statement . . . is to be taken as a threat, even if there is no intent of actually carrying it out, which threat, on its face and under the circumstances in which it is made, is so unequivocal, unconditional, immediate, and specific as to convey to the person threatened, a gravity of purpose and an immediate prospect of execution of the threat, and thereby causes that person reasonably to be in sustained fear for his or her own safety, is guilty of a violation of penal code section 422, a crime. [] . . . in order to prove this crime, each of the following elements must be proved: [] . . . [] 2. the person who made the threat did so with the specific intent 8 threats. [] if you look at caljic 9.94, you will see a breakdown of the 5 elements that the people are required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt before you can find the defendant guilty of making a criminal threat. [] element 1 requires that the defendant willfully threatened to commit a crime which, if committed, would result in death or great bodily injury to another person. [] as you were instructed in caljic 1.20, the word willingness to commit the act in question. so, for example, if you are considering the statement, as opposed to an accidental utterance. there is no specific intent required for one to act willfully. [] element 2 requires that the defendant made the threat with the specific intent that the statement be taken as a threat. [] in deciding whether the defendant possessed the specific intent required in element 2, you may consider all of the circumstantial evidence regarding the conditions under which the statement was made to determine whether or not he possessed the specific intent that the statement be taken as a threat. when considering circumstantial evidence regarding this specific intent, the jury you were not instructed on the defense of duress, because it does not mentioning duress 9 lfully defendant asserts, the jurors were questioning whether the excessive force caused him to be under duress in the everyday sense of the word. defendant contends the response to ument was not raised in the trial court. as a result, it cannot be raised on appeal. (people v. dykes (2009) 46 cal.4th 731, 802; see generally, e.g., people v. fuiava (2012) 53 cal.4th 622, 691; people v. riggs (2008) 44 cal.4th 248, 324.) even if defendant had not forfeited the argument, we would not find any abuse of be any disagreement between them as to the testimony, or if they desire to be informed on any point of law arising in the case, they must require the officer to conduct them into ob. the original instructions are themselves full and complete, the court has discretion . . . to determine what additional explanations are sufficient to satisfy the people v. dykes, supra, 46 cal.4th at p. 802; accord, people v. beardslee (1991) 53 cal.3d 68, 97; people v. yarbrough (2008) 169 cal.app.4th 303, 316-317.) here the trial court appropriately directed the instructions. the trial court in its discretion could reasonably conclude any further and evereasonably probable the result would have been more favorable to defendant absent the error. (people v. ainsworth (1988) 45 cal.3d 984, 1020; people v. eid (2010) 187 cal.app.4th 859, 882; people v. solis, supra, 90 cal.app.4th at p. 1015 [watson test 10 applies]; see people v. beardslee, supra, defendant uttered the threat while engaged in a violent struggle. the jury was not required to find defendant intended to actually carry out his threat. (in re george t., supra, 33 cal.4th at p. 630; people v. toledo, supra, 26 cal.4th at pp. 227-228.) therefore, even if the jury concluded defendant only sought to stop the violent struggle, it would likely still find he intended his words be taken as a threat. defendant has not shown further clarification of the instructions would have led the jury to conclude he did not specifically intend that his words be taken as a threat. we would reach the conclusion the alleged error was harmless if we applied the chapman v. california (1967) 386 u.s. 18, 22 standard of review. (people v. flood (1998) 18 cal.4th 470, 502-503.) defendant argues the trial court abused its discretion when it declined to strike one of the two prior convictions alleged under sections 667, subdivisions (b) through (i) and 1170.12. defendant reasons his two prior convictions were adjudicated in a single matter, case no. va006602. further, he committed those crimes in 1990, nearly 20 years prior to the present offenses, when he was only 16 years old. our review is for an abuse of discretion. (people v. carmony (2004) 33 cal.4th 367, 373-376; people v. smith (2012) 203 cal.app.4th 1051, 1062-1063.) no abuse of discretion occurred. a trial court has discretion under section 1385, subdivision (a) to strike a prior felony conviction allegation in furtherance of justice. (people v. carmony, supra, 33 cal.4th at p. 373; people v. superior court (romero)(1996) 13 cal.4th 497, 529-530.) consider whether, in light of the nature and circumstances of his present felonies and prior serious and/or violent felony convictions, and the particulars of his background, 11 whole or in part, and hence should be treated as though he had not previously been people v. williams (1998) 17 cal.4th 148, 161; accord, people v. carmony, supra, 33 cal.4th at p. 377.) on appeal, arbitrary. (people v. carmony, supra, 33 cal.4th at pp. 376-377; people v. superior court (alvarez) (1997) 14 cal.4th 968, 977-978.) defendant had a long criminal history dating from 1988 to 2009 when he was arrested for the offenses at issue here. as a juvenile, in may 1988, defendant had a sustained petition for possession, manufacture or sale of a dangerous weapon. (pen. code,  12020, subd. (a).) he was ordered to camp community placement. also as a juvenile, in july 1989, a petition alleging marijuana possession (health & saf. code,  11357, subd. (b)) was sustained and defendant was again ordered to camp community placement. in september 1992, defendant was convicted in case no. va006602 of two counts of firearm assault. (pen. code,  245, subd. (a)(2).) he was sentenced to nine years in state prison. at the time of his arrest, on september 13, 1990, defendant was 16 years old. in march 1996, defendant was convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm. (pen. code,  12021, subd. (a)(1).) he was sentenced to six years in prison. in december 2002 and again in october 2004, defendant was arrested on parole violations and ordered to finish his term. in july 2007, defendant was convicted of misdemeanor probation. a violation hearing was scheduled in the trial court for march 10, 2010. and in april 2009, defendant was convicted of driving with a suspended license (veh. code, the matter was set for a violation hearing in the trial court on march 10, 2010. on june 24, 2009, however, defendant was arrested on the present charges. -year period. he was only 14 when he was first arrested on a dangerous weapon charge. he had previously been found to have committed two serious felonies. the serious and recidivist nature of his crimes demonstrate he is a danger to the public. defendant has failed to 12 show that the trial court abused its discretion when it deemed him not outside the spirit of sections 667, subdivisions (b) through (i) and 1170.12. d. the abstract of judgment the abstract of judgment reflects that the sentences on counts 6 and 9 through 12 were stayed under section 654, subdivision (a). the parties agree that the abstract of judgment must be amended to also reflect that the sentence on each of those counts was 25 years-to-life. additionally, the trial court orally imposed a $50 criminal laboratory use of tmandatory penalties and surcharge be added to the criminal laboratory analysis fee. (people v. voit (2011) 200 cal.app.4th 1353, 1372-1373; people v. sharret (2011) 191 cal.app.4th 859, 864.) the parties agree that the abstract of judgment must be amended to reflect both the $50 fee and $130 in penalty assessments, specifically: a $50 state penalty ( 1464, subd. (a)(1)); a $35 county penalty (gov. code,  76000, subd. (a)(1)); a $10 state surcharge (pen. code,  1465.7, subd. (a)); a $15 state court construction penalty (gov. code,  70372, subd. (a)(1)); a $5 deoxyribonucleic acid penalty (gov. code,  76104.6, subd. (a)(1)); a $5 state-only deoxyribonucleic acid penalty (gov. code,  76104.7, subd. (a)); and a $10 emergency medical services penalty (gov. code,  76000.5, subd. (a)(1)). iv. disposition the judgment is affirmed. upon remittitur issuance, the abstract of judgment must be amended to reflect that the sentence on each of counts 6 and 9 through 12 was 25 years to life. further, the abstract of judgment must be amended as discussed in part iii (d) of this opinion to reflect imposition of the penalties and surcharge. the superior court clerk must then deliver a copy of the corrected abstract of judgment to the department of corrections and rehabilitation. 13 not to be published in the official reports turner, p.j. we concur: mosk, j. kriegler, j.
