(a)(1)); two counts of resisting an executive officer (pen. code,  69); and driving with suspended or revoked driving privileges (veh. code,  14601.1, subd. (a)). it was alleged that he had been released on bail or on his own recognizance when he committed three of the offenses; that he had suffered four prior convictions and served prison terms for those offenses within the meaning of penal code section 667.5, subdivision (b); and that he had previously been convicted three times of violating section 11378 and once of violating section 11379 for the purposes of section 11370.2 and penal code section 1203.07, subdivision (a)(11). 1 unless otherwise indicated, all further references are to the health and safety code. 3 izar unsuccessfully moved to unseal, quash, and traverse the search warrant. subsequently, izar entered a negotiated plea in which he pleaded nolo contendere to one count of possessing a controlled substance for sale and admitted three prior convictions for the purposes of section 11370.2. the remaining charges and allegations were dismissed pursuant to the plea agreement. izar was sentenced to the upper term of three years for the substantive offense, plus nine additional years pursuant to section 11370.2 for the prior convictions, for a total sentence of 12 years. failure to file a notice of appeal. izar appeals. discussion i. section 11370.2 enhancements izar contends, and the people agree, that the three three-year sentence enhancements imposed pursuant to section 11370.2 should be stricken because of an amendment to that statute. senate bill no. 180 (stats. 2017, ch. 677), which became effective on january 1, 2018, amended section 11370.2, subdivision (a) to limit the scope of that enhancement to apply only to prior felony convictions for a violation of section 11380. convictions for violations of section 11378 and 11379. absent evidence to the contrary, it is presumed the legislature intended an amended statute reducing the punishment for a criminal offense to apply retroactively to defendants whose judgments are not yet final on the statupeople v. brown (2012) 54 cal.4th 314, 323; in re estrada (1965) 63 cal.2d 740, 745.) because there is no indication that the legislature intended the amendments to section 11370.2 to operate 4 under the statute must be stricken. ii. independent review of search warrant affidavit all or any part of a search warrant affidavit may be sealed if necessary to protect the identity of a confidential informant. (evid. code,  1041; hobbs, supra, 7 cal.4th at p. 971.) defendant seeks to quash or traverse a warrant where a portion of the supporting affidavit has been sealed, the relevant materials are to be made available for in camera review by the (people v. galland (2008) 45 cal.4th 354, 364.) court should determine first whether there are sufficient grounds for maintaining the cons identity. if so, the court should then determine whether the sealing of the cessary to avoid revealing [citation.] once the affidavit is found to have been properly sealed, the court should proceed to presented in the search warrant affidavit and the oral testimony, that contraband or evidence of a crime would be found in the place searched pursuant to tmoved to quash the wars general allegations of material misrepresentations or omissions are supported by the public and sealed portions of the search warrant affidavit, including any testimony offered at the in camera (ibid.; hobbs, at pp. 972-975.) we have reviewed the entire record, including the search warrant, the sealed and unsealed portions of the affidavit, and 5 the transcript of the in-camera hearing conducted by the trial court. based on our independent review of those materials, we conclude it is not reasonably probable izar would have prevailed on any aspect of his motion to unseal, quash or traverse the warrant. the trial court acted well within its discretion in determining valid grounds existed for maintaining the s confidentiality, and that sealing a portion of the affidavit was necessary ts identity. we have examined the entire affidavit for possible misleading statements or omissions and have found nothing that leads us to suspect any material misrepresentations or omissions were made. under the totality of the circumstances, there was a fair probability that execution of the warrant would lead to contraband or evidence of a crime at the location to be searched. accordingly, the trial court properly denied motion to unseal, quash, and traverse the warrant. disposition the judgment is modified to strike the three three-year enhancement terms imposed pursuant to health and safety code section 11370.2. the judgment is affirmed as modified. the superior court is ordered to prepare an amended abstract of judgment reflecting the modified judgment and to forward a copy to the department of corrections and rehabilitation. zelon, acting p. j. we concur: segal, j. feuer, j.
