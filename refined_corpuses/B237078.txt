filed 11/19/12 p. v. gonzales ca2/8 not to be published in the official reports california rules of court, rule 8.1115(a), prohibits courts and parties from citing or relying on opinions not certified for publication or ordered published, except as specified by rule 8.1115(b). this opinion has not been certified for publication or ordered published for purposes of rule 8.1115. in the court of appeal of the state of california second appellate district division eight the people, plaintiff and respondent, v. juan gonzales, defendant and appellant. b237078 (los angeles county super. ct. no. ka093029) appeal from the judgment of the superior court of los angeles county. mike camacho, judge. affirmed. allison h. ting, under appointment by the court of appeal, for defendant and appellant. kamala d. harris, attorney general, dane r. gillette, chief assistant attorney general, lance e. winters, senior assistant attorney general, shawn mcgahey webb and esther p. kim, deputy attorneys general, for plaintiff and respondent. * * * * * * * * * * 2 defendant juan gonzales was charged by information with two felony counts of driving under the influence (veh. code,  23152, subd. (a), count 1; 23152, subd. (b), count 2), with prior driving under the influence convictions (veh. code,  23152, subd. (b), 23550, 23550.5), as well as prior strike and prison term allegations (pen. code,  1170.12, subds. (a)-(d), 667, subds. (b)-(i), 667.5, subd. (b)). defendant pled no contest to counts one and two, and admitted his strike adjudication and prison terms. he moved to dismiss the strike under romero,1 on the basis that it arose from a juvenile adjudication the prior strike allegation, the trial court sentenced defendant to five years in prison, consisting of the midterm sentence of two years on count 2, doubled under the three strikes law, plus a one-year enhancement for his prison prior (one of his prison priors was dismissed). the trial court also imposed and stayed a two-year term on count 1. on appeal, defendant contends it was unconstitutional to use his juvenile adjudication as a strike, and that the trial court abused its discretion when it denied his motion to dismiss and therefore affirm. discussion 1. constitutional claims defendant contends his juvenile adjudication, although it satisfies the statutory requisites of a strike (pen. code,  667, subd. (d)(3), 1170.12, subd. (b)(3)), could not constitutionally be considered a strike because in juvenile adjudications, the court and not a jury is the factfinder. defendant relies on a number of federal cases, including u.s. v. tighe (9th cir. 2001) 266 f.3d 1187, for the proposition that the holding in apprendi v. new jersey (2000) 530 u.s. 466 (apprendi) requires a prior strike conviction to be obtained through proceedings that included the right to a jury trial and proof beyond a reasonable doubt. (see idthat increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be 1 people v. superior court (romero) (1996) 13 cal.4th 497 (romero). 3 tighe, supra, 266 f.3d at p. 1194.) however, in people v. nguyen (2009) 46 cal.4th 1007, our supreme court apprendi does not prohibit the use of juvenile adjudications to enhance a criminal penalty, even though they are not tried to a jury. our supreme court concluded that under apprendi . . be determined by a jury in the current case. [] . . . the statutorily relevant sentencing . conduct that qualifies, under the three strikes law, as a basis for enhancing his current sentence. . . . [t]he literal rule of apprendi . . . required only that a jury in the current nguyen, supra, 46 cal.4th at p. 1015, italics omitted.) therefore, defendant had the right to a jury trial in this case to decide whether his record included the juvenile adjudication of criminal conduct that qualifies as a strike. but, like the defendant in nguyen, defendant expressly waived his right to a jury trial in this case. (id. at p. 1011.) defendant acknowledges that nguyen bound by nguyen(auto equity sales, inc. v. superior court (1962) 57 cal.2d 450, 455.) 2. romero motion defendant also complains that the trial court abused its discretion when it denied his motion to dismiss his juvenile strike adjudication. he contends that the strike crime, which happened 19 years before sentencing in this case, was too remote, and that he does not fall within the spirit of the tand find no abuse of discretion. trial courts have discretion under penal code section 1385 to dismiss three strikes allunder the abuse of discretion standard of review. (romero, supra, 13 cal.4th at p. 530; people v. carrasco (2008) 163 cal.app.4th 978, 992-993.) the burden is on the party 4 attacking the sentence to show the sentencing decision was an abuse of discretion. in the absence of such a showing, the trial court is presumed to have acted appropriately, and a sentence will not be set aside on review. (people v. carmony (2004) 33 cal.4th 367, 376-377.) an abuse of discretion occurs only when the trial court was not aware of its discretion to dismiss, where the court considered impermissible factors, or where the defendant clearly falls outside the spirit of the three strikes law. (people v. scott (2009) 179 cal.app.4th 920, 926.) the analysis is whether, in light of the nature and background, character, and prospects, he may be deemed outside the spirit of the three strikes law and should therefore be treated as if he had not previously been convicted of the qualifying felony. (carrasco, at p. 993.) weapon (pen. code,  245using a pole. following his juvenile adjudication, defendant went on to live a life of crime, with a february 1994 conviction for carrying a concealed weapon (former pen. code,  12025, as amended by stats. 1992, ch. 1340,  6), and convictions for driving under the influence in june 2002, january 2003, march 2004, and september 2007. (veh. code,  23152.) he was also convicted in april 2006 of driving on a suspended license. (veh. code,  1460influence carried a prison term of 16 months. he received probation and jail terms for his making a left-hand turn into oncoming traffic. his blood alcohol content was one and a half times the legal limit.2 (veh. code,  23152, subd. (b).) in his romero motion, defendant argued he was a minor when he committed his strike offense, he cooperated with officers during his arrest for his current offenses, and 2 defendant had a blood alcohol content of 0.128 percent in his initial screening, with a later test showing a blood alcohol content of 0.11 percent. 5 outside of prison, especially his relationship with his son, as a higher priority in his life . . . subsequent to that prior strike up to and includsentence for his 2007 conviction, but had made no effort to address his drinking problem court stated that it understood its discretion under romero, but found that defendant was the trial court clearly understood the scope of its discretion and decided not to dismiss the juvenile strike allegation because defendant had not lived a crime-free life after his 1992 offense but instead, time after time, endangered others by driving under the his repeated convictions. the trial court did not err in finding defendant is the kind of criminal the three strikes law was intended to punish, notwithstanding his stated remorse and desire to improve his life.
