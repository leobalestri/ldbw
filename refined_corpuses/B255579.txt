(pen. code,  1305.4.) establish good cause, the surety must demonstrate both due diligence and a reasonable likelihood of recapture. (people v. accredited surety casualty (2014) 230 cal.app.4th 548, 560.) the declaration of don anderson submitted with the motion to extend the exoneration period contained information related to g information from individuals familiar with elfaki and followed up on several sightings of him in southern california. 4 s not in the appellate record, and we have no way of determining what showing continental made to support its motion. 4 wrongful interference . . . continental argued that the national crime information center (ncic) prevented it from surrendering the fugitive into custody and thus required exoneration. on november 27, 2013, the trial court continued the hearing on the motion to vacate forfeiture and for exoneration of bail bond to december 17. on that day, the trial court received a notice from counsel for continental ance he court ordered the motion off calendar. on january 3, 2014, continental filed another motion to vacate forfeiture and for exoneration of bail bond.5 the matter, which was set for hearing on january 24, was continued to february 14. on february 14, maria grimeldo testified for the people,6 and no. 1, a certified document from the ncic, was marked for identification but not received into evidence. the trial court denied the motion to exonerate the bond on grounds of misidentification and police interference7 and e date noted on page 12 of no. 1.8 continental thereafter made an oral motion pursuant to penal code section 980, subdivision (b),9 and further proceedings were continued to march 6. 5 this motion is not in the appellate record. 6 testimony are a mystery. 7 enying the motion for exoneration of bail are rationale. 8 record on appeal, we have no way to determine the date to which the court referred. 9 the clerk shall require the appropriate agency to enter each bench warrant issued on a private surety-bonded felony case into the national warrant system (national crime information center (ncic)). if the appropriate agency fails to enter the bench warrant into the national warrant system 5 on march 6, 2014, after reading and considering the de10 tion to vacate the forfeiture based on penal code section 980,11 the only remaining ground for the motion based on . on march 12, the clerk of the superior court executed an application for entry of judgment and summary judgment against continental on the forfeited bond. the same day, the court entered summary judgment in favor of the people and against continental in the amount of $200,000, plus $370 in court costs for a total of $200,370.12 on march (ncic), and the court finds that this failure prevented the surety or bond agent from surrendering the fugitive into custody, prevented the fugitive from being arrested or taken having jurisdiction over the bail shall, upon petition, set aside the forfeiture of the bond an 10 in support of its october 31, 2013 motion to vacate forfeiture and for exoneration of bail bond, continental submitted the declaration of michael esparza, among others. because the declaration hearing is not in the record on appeal or identified in any other way, we have no way of knowing whether it was the same or a different declaration. 11 although the minutes do not state the couthis portion of the t 12 the trial court acted in excess of its jurisdiction, but with fundamental jurisdiction, in extending the exoneration period for more than 180 days. (people v. bankers ins. co. (2010) 182 cal.app.4th 1377, 1380, 1382-1386.) while continental does not challenge the timeliness of the summary judgment in its opening brief, the people, in footnote 4 of granting a further extension of the appearance [or exoneration] period under [penal code] section 1305.4, continental would be estopped from claiming that the subsequent summary judgment was untimely entered. (people v. bankers ins. co., supra, 182 cal.app.4th at pp. 1382-(capitalization omitted.) the people are correct. in people v. bankers ins. co., supra, 182 cal.app.4th 1377, the trial court extended the exoneration period three times for a total of more than 180 days. as a result, the trial court entered summary judgment later than it was required to do so by statute. while the reviewing court concluded that the trial court exceeded its jurisdiction in extending the exoneration period more than 180 days and that the trial court granted 6 25, continental filed a timely notice of appeal from the march 6 order denying its motion to vacate and set aside the bond forfeiture. continental did not appeal from the summary judgment. discussion a. standard of review denying motion to vacate forfeiture and exonerate bond for an abuse of discretion.
