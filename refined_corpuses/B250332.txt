filed 10/27/14 p. v. compton ca2/2 not to be published in the official reports california rules of court, rule 8.1115(a), prohibits courts and parties from citing or relying on opinions not certified for publication or ordered published, except as specified by rule 8.1115(b). this opinion has not been certified for publication or ordered published for purposes of rule 8.1115. in the court of appeal of the state of california second appellate district division two the people, plaintiff and respondent, v. douglas compton, defendant and appellant. b250332 (los angeles county super. ct. no. ba372410) appeal from a judgment of the superior court of los angeles county. robert j. perry, judge. affirmed. peter gold, under appointment by the court of appeal, for defendant and appellant. kamala d. harris, attorney general, lance e. winters, assistant attorney general, james william bilderback ii and brendan sullivan, deputy attorneys general, for plaintiff and respondent. 2 defendant douglas compton was convicted of a double homicide and, as a third strike offender, sentenced to 95 years to life plus 17 years in prison. he raises three challenges to his convictions. none provides a basis for reversal, and we affirm. facts and procedural history two men (who were brothers) were gunned down on a sidewalk in los angeles, the people charged defendant with the first degree murder (pen. code,  187, subd. (a))1 of each brother, with being a felon in possession of a firearm ( 12021), and with various firearm enhancements. a jury convicted defendant of the second degree murder of one brother; the manslaughter of the other; and the use of a firearm. discussion i. motion for personnel records (pitchess2 motion) months after the shootings, two detectives (detectives leonardo mckenzie and tommy thompson) interviewed potential witness james green. two months later, a third detective (detective daniel gersna) interviewed potential witness eric nelson. each interview was recorded; during those interviews, green and nelson each identified defendant as country and as involved in the shootings. however, when green and nelson were later called as witnesses at drecanted his prior statements. specifically, each testified that (1) he was not the person speaking on the recording; and (2) he was the person on the recording, but the detectives had threatened him to implicate defendant in the moments before the recording devices were turned on. defendant thereafter filed a motion asking the trial court to conduct an in camera incidents of witness coercion. (this is referred to as a pitchess motion, after the 1974 decision first 1 all further statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise indicated. 2 pitchess v. superior court (1974) 11 cal.3d 531. 3 proffer any reason why the detectives would try to frame defendant. the trial court denied the motion without conducting an in camera hearing after finding deshearing testimony. the motion is irrelevant. we may only ask whether the trial court abused its discretion by outside the bounds of reason. (sisson v. superior court (2013) 216 cal.app.4th 24, 34 (sisson).) the personnel records of peace officers, including citizens complaints made against them, are privileged. ( 832.7, 832.5, 832.8.) this privilege yields to a criminal brant v. superior court (2003) 108 cal.app.4th 100, 106.) in recognition of this right, a court will conduct an in camera review of an oinformation that could support a defense, but only if the defendant establishes , subds. (a), (b)(3).) id.,  1043, subd. specific factual scenario of officer misconduct [in his case] that is plausible(uybungco v. superior court (2008) 163 cal.app.4th 1043, 1048-1049 (uybungco)); and on [he seeks] and a proposed defense to a sisson, supra, 216 cal.app.4th at p. 36). (garcia v. superior court (2007) 42 cal.4th 63, 70, 72), but it is not meaningless. there is a logical link in this case between the information defendant sought in his pitchess motion and his proffered defense. (accord, people v. memro (1985) 38 cal.3d 658, 681-684 [defendant alleging officers coerced a confession; defense may be entitled to in camera misconduct], overruled on other grounds in people v. gaines (2009) 46 cal.4th 172.) the question here is accordingly whether the specific factual scenario defendant offered 4 up was plausible . . . in light of the pertinent documents in this case. (uybungco, supra, 163 cal.app.4th at pp. 1048-1049.) to be plausible, a scenario need not be persuasive, reasonably probable, or credible. (people v. thompson (2006) 141 cal.app.4th 1312, 1316-1319 (thompson); people v. sanderson (2010) 181 cal.app.4th 1334, 1340-1341.) but courts can reject a scenario as implausible if it is (1) incomplete (thompson, supra, 141 cal.app.4th at pp. 1316-1317 [defendant did not explain why he was in a drug-infested area; incomplete]; city of san jose v. superior court (1998) 67 cal.app.4th 1135, 1147 [defendant alleging mishandling of evidence did not explain which evidence was mishandled, or how; incomplete]); (2) internally inconsistent (people v. galan (2009) 178 cal.app.4th 6, 8-9 (galan) [allegations in support of discovery inconsistent with own prior, unchallenged statements and other unchallenged evidence]); or (3) at odds with common sense (people v. lewis and oliver (2006) 39 cal.4th 970, 991-992 (lewis and oliver) [defendant alleging police conspiracy to plant drugs on him and make up a story that he was involved in a drug transaction; not plausible]; thompson, supra, 141 cal.app.4th at pp. 1318-1319 [same]). the trial court concluded that dwas internally inconsistent with one of the pertinent documents before itnamely, the preliminary hearing transcripts. (sisson, supra, 216 cal.app.4th at p. 31 & fn.3 [court irreconcilable with dwere on the recordings making coerced statements. (accord, galan, supra, 178 cal.app.4th at pp. 8-9.) to be sure, dtestimony, where they (inconsistently) state they were on the recordings. but the trial alternatively, defendant alleged that the three detectives independently conducted two interviews of different people at different times, but used exactly the same coercive technique (namely, making threats before turning on a recording device) to frame 5 defendant without any proffered reason for doing so. a court does not abuse its discplausible. (lewis and oliver, supra, 39 cal.4th at pp. 991-992; thompson, supra, 141 cal.app.4th at pp. 1317-1318.) although the trial court did not rely on this additional rationale, we may. (people v. chism (2014) 58 cal.4th 1266, 1295 & fw][its] reasoning) ii. monikers in rap sheets defendant also sought to introduce his criminal history report (or rap sheet) because it contained the monikers defendant had admitted to using; country was not among them. the court excluded the rap sheet. is admissible to prove that he served a particular prior prison sentence. (people v. martinez (2000) 22 cal.4th 106, 111-112 (martinez); people v. dunlap (1993) 18 cal.app.4th 1468, 1471-1472 (dunlap).) in this situation, the rap sheet qualifies as an on out-of-court statements. (evid. code,  1200, 1280.) the official records exception applies to w, that are (1) made , (2) at or near the time of the act, condition, or event, and (3) prepared in a manner that renders the record trustworthy (and trustworthiness will be presumed). (evid. code,  1280 [exception], 664 [presumption that official duty is performed]; dunlap, supra, 18 cal.app.4th at p. 1477.) defendant argues that the monikers that persons report to police, and which police must then include in rap sheets ( 13125), should be treated the same as other facts on a rap sheet (such as the service of a prison sentence). we disagree. by its plain terms, the s a record of an act, condition, or event . . . when offered . . . to prove the act, condition, a monikerunlike an arrest, conviction, or service of a prison sentencecondition, e, the exception would allow at most a defendant to ition, (namely, that the defendant provided certain monikers), not that he actually used those monikers. unlike the verifiable information at 6 issue in martinez and dunlap, a -report of his nicknames is an unverified statement that no public employee could (or is under any duty to) verify. it constitutes an additional layer of hearsay that, absent a pertinent exception, is inadmissible. (e.g., people v. edwards a defendant in a criminal case may not introduce hearsay evidence for the purpose of testifying while avoiding cross-examination..) the trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the rap sheets for d proffered purpose. (people v. goldsmith (2014) 59 cal.4th 258, 266.) we reject drelated due process argument for the same reasons. iii. self-representation on the day set for the bench trial regarding dthe hearing on his new trial motion, and for sentencing, defendant announced he wanted to the bench trial and on the new trial motion. the court denied the request as untimely and, in conjunction with dsed sentence. a criminal defendant has a federal constitutional right to represent himself at trial once he knowingly and intelligently waives the right to counsel. (faretta v. california (1975) 422 u.s. 806, 834-835; people v. doolin (2009) 45 cal.4th 390, 453 (doolin).) defendant contends that the trial court violated this right. what defendant meant by his clear. to the extent defendant sought to represent himself only as to the new trial motion but not the prior convictions trial or sentencing (as he contends on appeal), his request is equivocal and was properly denied on that basis. (see lewis and oliver, supra, 39 cal.4th at p. ings by switching between requests for counsel and for self-doolin, supra, 45 cal.4th at p. 453 [equivocal requests may be denied].) 7 to the extent defendant sought to represent himself for all further proceedings (as the trial court understood), his request was untimely. a trial on prior convictions and a new trial motion are considered part of the overall trial. (doolin, supra, 45 cal.4th at p. 454; people v. rivers (1993) 20 cal.app.4th 1040, 1048 (rivers); cf. people v. miller (2007) 153 cal.app.4th 1015, 1023-1024 [request made after prior conviction trial and new trial motion, but well in advance of sentencing; timely as to sentencing].) a request for self-representation made after a jury verdict but before these other stages is accordingly not trial beginsuntimely. (doolin, supra, 45 cal.4th at p. 453, italics added; see rivers, supra, 20 cal.app.4th at p. 1048 [applying this rule to bench trials on prior convictions].) a court has discretion to deny an untimely request. (doolin, supra, 45 cal.app.4th at p. 453.) in exercising this discretion, a court may consider a variety of the to subsand the disruption and delay self-representation might entail. (people v. windham (1977) 19 cal.3d 121, 128.) here, the court noted the lateness of the request as well as dein a separate proceeding. although defendant did not request a continuance in this case, the court could fairly infer such a request would follow a grant of self-representation status and thereby disrupt the three pending proceedings set for that daywas within its discretion. further, any error was harmlessalready filed new trial motion was based on the perceived inconsistency of t which is not a basis for reversal. (people v. carbajal (2013) 56 cal.4th 521, 532.) moreover, defendant admitted his prior convictions. defendant offers no argument as to how he would have handled either of these proceedings, or sentencing, differently on his own. (see rivers, supra, 20 cal.app.4th at pp. 1050-1052 [court may look to likely effect of postdenial proceedings in assessing harmlessness].) 8 disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. hoffstadt, j. we concur: boren, p.j. chavez, j.
