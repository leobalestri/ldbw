(defendant) filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus seeking to vacate his sentence of life without the possibility of parole because, in his view, the evidence presented to the jury was insufficient to meet the evidentiary minimum required by penal code section 190.2,1 subdivision (d), as construed by people v. banks (2015) 61 cal.4th 788 (banks) and people v. clark (2016) 63 cal.4th 522 (clark). we summarily denied his petition, and our supreme court granted review and directed us to vacate our denial and issue an order to show cause why defendant was not entitled to relief. we have received the filings and conclude that defendantis without merit; accordingly, we deny it. facts and procedural background i. facts on june 9, 1999, three men walked into classic wholesale jewelers, a store in the jewelry district of downtown los angeles; pulled the trigger, killing the owner; all of the men then fled without taking any jewelry. moments before the robbery began, five or six men had pulled up in two cars just across the street from classic wholesale jewelers. defendant was one of those men. the evidence is conflicting as to whether defendant was one of the three men who entered the jewelry store: one bystander, who had seen defendant previously, repeatedly testified at trial that 1 all further statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise indicated. 3 defendant had gone inside, but had previously testified at the preliminary hearing that defendant had remained outside near one of the cars. tdid not identify defendant as one of three robbers, but acknowledged that she was behind the counter and could not see what was happening for part of the time. minutes after the robbery ended, defendant was pulled over driving one of the two cars; the man identified as the shooter was a passenger. this was not the first time defendant and the others had participated in armed robberies. just seven weeks earlier, on april 20, 1999, defendant and two others walked into the guadalajara jewelry shop, and one of the robbers pointed a gun at two people inside while the other two robbers stuffed their shirts with jewelry. that same day, two bystanders saw defendant and two others enter a different jewelry store; a few minutes later, the bystanders saw defendant run by with a gun in his hand and jewelry stuffed under his shirt. nine days later, on april 29, 1999, defendant and four others congregated near sarah jewelers in the same area. three of those men (but not defendant) went inside, and one of them (different from the shooter at classic wholesale jewelers in june 1999) held a gun to e the other two took jewelry. ii. procedural history as pertinent to this petition, the people charged defendant with murder in the commission of the june 1999 attempted robbery and burglary ( 187 & 190.2, subd. (a)(17)). the jury was instructed that it could impose a sentence of life without the possibility of parole under section 190.2 only if it found that 4 indiffe a jury so found, and we affirmed his conviction and sentence after rejecting a challenge to the section 190.2 finding. on february 15, 2017, defendant filed this petition for a writ of habeas corpus, his second such petition, asking this court to vacate the section 190.2 finding for insufficient evidence in light of our requirements in banks and clark. we summarily denied the petition. on may 10, 2017, our supreme court granted review and directed us to vacate our denial and issue an order to show cause why defendant was not entitled to relief. discussion section 190.2 finding is not supported by sufficient evidence. the people argue that defendant is procedurally barred from raising this issue in this habeas proceeding. we first address the threshold procedural question. i. procedural bar the people argue that we may not reach the merits of sufficiency-of-the-evidence challenge because (1) it was raised and rejected on appeal, and is thus barred by in re waltreus (1965) 62 cal.2d 218, 225 (waltreus), and (2) such challenges are specifically not permitted on habeas under in re lindley (1947) 29 cal.2d 709, 723 (lindley). both of these arguments were recently considered, and rejected, in in re miller (2017) 14 cal.app.5th 960, 977-980. we agree with miller. the so-called waltreus bar does not applyand does not preclude consideration of an issue on habeas notwithstanding its prior consideration during a direct appeal 5 in a case such as this one, where a court has subsequently [a] crime [or enhancement] the previously addressed issue. (people v. mutch (1971) 4 cal.3d 389, 395-399.) that is the situation here. and the so-called lindley bar is designed to preclude relitigation on habeas of in re reno (2012) 55 cal.4th 428, 505.) evaluating the sufficiency of the evidence under a newly refined statutory outside of lindleys reach. ii. merits a person who is convicted of first degree murder on the theory that he aided and abetted a robbery that resulted in a death (rather than being the actual killer) may only be sentenced to life without the possibility of parole if he (1) acted with the intent to kill ( 190.2, subd. (c)); or (2) (a) was n the underlying robbery, and (b) acted )). the elements of section 190.2, subdivision (d) are drawn fromand designed to incorporatethe holdings of two united states supreme court casestison v. arizona (1987) 481 u.s. 137 (tison) and enmund v. florida (1982) 458 u.s. 782 (enmund).

(banks, supra, 61 cal.4th at p. 805; enmund, supra, 458 u.s. at pp. 784-787; tison, supra, 481 u.s. at p. 147.) he points to the evidence from witnesses putting him outside of classic wholesale jewelers on the date of the shooting, appears more likely from the testimony that [defendant] stayed by the car. and, in addition, [defendant] is not identified by but, as noted above, the bystander repeatedly testified at trial that defendant entered the store, and because , the theories argued in closing do not bind the jury. (people v. perez (1992) 2 cal.4th 1117, 1125-1126; cf. people v. smith (2005) 37 cal.4th 733, 740, fn. 2 [in a case not involving substantial evidence review or purporting to define a standard for such review, solely for purposes of deciding whether a defendant may be convicted of two counts of attempted murder when firing a single shot, were fired, because that only one bullet entered the at bottom, defendant is asking us to reweigh the 10 conflicting evidence and come to a different conclusion than the jury; this, we cannot do. ing that defendant acted with reckless indifference to human life is also supported by substantial evidence. here, there was ample evidence from which a jury could reasonably infer that he was subjectively aware that his acts were likely to result in the taking of an innocent life. (banks, supra, 61 cal.4th at pp. 801-802.) although a awareness of a grave risk of death (id. at p. 809, fn. 8), [a] use of a firearm, even if [he] does not kill the victim . . . , [is] significant to the analysis of reckless indifference to human life (clark, supra, 63 cal.4th at p. 618). here, one, and potentially both, of the jewelry store robberies on april 20. he was part of moreover, as explained above, the jury could reasonably find that defendant was inside classic wholesale jewelers on june 9, so he had close proximity to the charged murder as well as the events leading up to it. although the robbery lasted only a matter of minutes, and defendant had no advance notice that anyone would pull the trigger, defendantunlike the mastermind in clark who told his cohorts only to use unloaded weaponsdid not take steps to minimize the likelihood that someone might fire the weapon or to otherwise minimize the risk of violence. defendant asserts that there was no plan to shoot the owner of classic wholesale jewelers, and that death by shooting that day was spontaneous and unplannedas evidenced by the fact that the robbers fled without taking any 11 jewelry. further, defendant notes, there was no evidence that cohorts had ever fired the guns they had previously to be sure, defendant is correct that there was no plan to kill the jewelry store owner and hence insufficient evidence of an intent to kill, but such an intent is irrelevant to the inquiry under section 190.2, subdivision (d). and while the absence of prior shootings precludes a finding that the shooting on june 9 was a certainty, a jury need only find that likely to rbanks, supra, 61 cal.4th at pp. 801-802, italics addedwith prior robberies where he witnessed others holding a gun to himself, given that he was inside classic wholesale jewelers on june 9, when the gun was loaded, and given the reasonable inference that the robbery team was using a loaded gun for all of its robberies, the jury had substantial evidence upon which to conclude that he was subjectively aware that taking of [an] 12 disposition the petition for writ of habeas corpus is denied. not to be published in the official reports. ______________________, j. hoffstadt we concur: _________________________, acting p. j. ashmann-gerst _________________________, j. chavez
