filed 1/31/19 p. v. smith ca2/1 not to be published in the official reports california rules of court, rule 8.1115(a), prohibits courts and parties from citing or relying on opinions not certified for publication or ordered published, except as specified by rule 8.1115(b). this opinion has not been certified for publication or ordered published for purposes of rule 8.1115. in the court of appeal of the state of california second appellate district division one the people, plaintiff and respondent, v. shicorey lee smith, defendant and appellant. b281860 (los angeles county super. ct. no. ba437361) appeal from a judgment of the superior court of los angeles county, david v. herriford, judge. conditionally reversed and remanded with directions. donna ford, under appointment by the court of appeal, for defendant and appellant. xavier becerra, attorney general, gerald a. engler, chief assistant attorney general, lance e. winters, assistant attorney general, jonathan m. krauss and lindsay boyd, deputy attorneys general, for plaintiff and respondent. 2 defendant shicorey l. smith appeals from the judgment after a jury convicted him of second degree robbery and carrying a loaded firearm. smith requests that we independently review the tranpitchess1 hearing. smith also requests that we remand so the trial court may exercise its discretion under amended penal code2 section 12022.53 to strike his 10-year firearm enhancement. the attorney general (respondent) does not oppose either request. we conclude the trial court erred in not disclosing one of the documents it reviewed during the pitchess hearing. we therefore conditionally reverse the judgment and remand so defense counsel may review the document and have an opportunity to demonstrate prejudice. we also direct the trial court to exercise its discretion under section 12022.53. procedural background the facts of the underlying offenses are not at issue in this appeal so we limit our summary to the relevant procedural history. an information charged smith with one count of second degree robbery ( 212.5, subd. (c)) and one count of carrying a loaded firearm ( 25850, subd. (a)). the information alleged that smith had personally used a firearm in committing the robbery ( 12022.53, subd. (b)). smith filed a pitchess motion seeking relevant records from the personnel file of detective gerald harden of the los angeles police department. 1 pitchess v. superior court (1974) 11 cal.3d 531 (pitchess). 2 undesignated statutory citations are to the penal code. 3 that harden had threatened to call the department of children smith did not cooperate with the investigation and admit to committing the robbery. smith claimed that his subsequent statements admitting to the robbery were coerced and false. equested confessions. the trial court denied the limiting request. the trial court then conducted an in camera hearing and concluded a jury convicted smith of all counts and found that smith had personally used a firearm in committing the robbery. the trial court sentenced smith to 12 years 8 months, including 10 years for the firearm enhancement under section 12022.53, subdivision (b), and imposed fines and fees and awarded credits. smith timely appealed. discussion a. the trial court erred in concluding there were no pitchess motion when requested to do so by a defendant, we independently review the transcript of the trial courts in camera pitchess hearing to determine whether the trial court disclosed all relevant complaints. (people v. mooc (2001) 26 cal.4th 1216, 1229.) smith has made such a request, and respondent does not object. we review a tripitchess motion for abuse of discretion. (people v. hughes (2002) 27 cal.4th 287, 330.) 4 having reviewed the pitchess hearing transcript, we conclude there was a responsive document the trial court failed to disclose. the trial court described a complaint, numbered 14002194, that harden had threatened to harm or harass the two complainants if they did not cooperate with an investigation. when an officer investigated the complaint, one complainant refused to provide any further information, and the officer could not reach the other complainant. the trial court ruled this complaint was not responsive to insufficient to constitute coercion given that the complainant had not provided any details. the trial court further concluded that on allegations that harden had threatened him in order to force him to cooperate with a criminal investigation. the complaint reviewed by the trial court alleged similar facts. although the complaint could not be substantiated given a lack of further people v. zamora (1980) 28 cal.3d 88, 93, fn. 1.) nor does it matter that the complaint may have been inadmissible, because the trial court was obliged to disclose people v. gaines (2009) 46 cal.4th 172, 182 (gaines).) pitchess error does not require reversal absent a showing of prejudice. (gaines, supra, 46 cal.4th at p. 182.) the trial court 5 shall direct the los angeles police department to disclose the complaint numbered 14002194 to defense counsel, who shall then be given the opportunity to demonstrate prejudice. the trial a reasonable probability of a different outcome had the evidence been disclosed.ibid.) otherwise, the judgment shall be reinstated. (see people v. wycoff (2008) 164 cal.app.4th 410, 416.) b. on remand, the trial court should exercise its firearm enhancement at the time the trial court sentenced smith, the 10-year firearm enhancement under section 12022.53, subdivision (b) was mandatory and could not be stricken. (people v. billingsley (2018) 22 cal.app.5th 1076, 1079 (billingsley).) effective january 1, 2018, the legislature amended the penal code to give the trial court discretion to strike the enhancement. (billingsley, at pp. 1079-1080.) respondent concedes the amendment applies id. at p. 1080.) smith requests that we remand so the trial court may exercise its discretion whether to strike the firearm enhancement. respondent does not oppose this request. accordingly, we grant it. 6 disposition the judgment is conditionally reversed and the cause remanded. the trial court shall direct the los angeles police department to disclose the complaint numbered 14002194 to defense counsel. the trial court shall then conduct further proceedings consistent with this opinion. if the trial court finds that smith has not established prejudice by the denial of discovery, the judgment shall be reinstated as of that date. the trial court is further directed to exercise its discretion firearm enhancement. if the trial court strikes the enhancement, the trial court shall reduce the sentence accordingly, amend the abstract of judgment, and forward the amended abstract of judgment to the department of corrections and rehabilitation. not to be published. bendix, j. we concur: rothschild, p. j. chaney, j.
