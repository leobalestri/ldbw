filed 5/16/17 p. v. tucker ca2/2 not to be published in the official reports california rules of court, rule 8.1115(a), prohibits courts and parties from citing or relying on opinions not certified for publication or ordered published, except as specified by rule 8.1115(b). this opinion has not been certified for publication or ordered published for purposes of rule 8.1115. in the court of appeal of the state of california second appellate district division two the people, plaintiff and respondent, v. milton tucker, jr., defendant and appellant. b271616 (los angeles county super. ct. no. na027035) appeal from an order of the superior court of los angeles county. david v. herriford, judge. affirmed. barbara a. smith, under appointment by the court of appeal, for defendant and appellant. kathleen a. kenealy, acting attorney general, gerald a. engler, chief assistant attorney general, lance e. winters, assistant attorney general, susan sullivan pithey, noah p. hill and michael j. wise, deputy attorneys general, for plaintiff and respondent. _______________________ 2 in 1996, defendant and appellant milton tucker, jr., pled no contest to taking a vehicle without the consent of the owner (veh. code,  10851, subd. (a)). in return for his plea, the trial court dismissed additional charges of possessing cocaine (health & saf. code,  11350, subd. (a)) and willfully evading a police officer (veh. code,  2800.2). based on the additional finding tions for robbery (pen. code,  211, 667, 1170.12; veh. code,  10851), he was law to an indeterminate term of 25 years to life in state prison. on november 30, 2012, defendant filed a petition for recall of his third strike sentence. the trial court issued an order to show cause why the petition should not be granted. the prosecution filed an opposition, and later a revised opposition, arguing that defendant was ineligible and unsuitable for crime involving possession of a firearm, spousal battery, and resisting a peace officer, as well as absconding from parole. defendant filed a reply and a supplemental reply, arguing that he did not pose any risk of danger to public safety. following several years of litigation, the trial court held a hearing and cpetition on the grounds that defendant posed an unreasonable risk to public safety pursuant to people v. esparza (2015) 242 cal.app.4th 726, 745746 (esparza), and was thus ineligible for recall and resentencing. (pen. code,  667, subd. (e)(2)(c)(iii), 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(c)(iii), 1170.126, subd. (e)(2).) 3 court erred in denying his petition for recall and resentencing (pen. code,  1170.126, prop. 36) because it declined to consider (prop. 47). on february 18, 2015, our supreme court granted review in people v. valencia (2014) 232 cal.app.4th 514 (valencia), in the proposition 36 context is pending before that court in both valencia, supra, s223825, and people v. chaney (2014) 231 cal.app.4th 1391 (chaney), review granted february 18, 2015, s223676. in view of the posture of this issue, we shall not belabor the point but simply conclude, as did the court in esparza, supra, 242 cal.app.4th 726,1 that the voters in enacting proposition 47 did not intend for its definition of danger to extend to petitions under proposition 36, and thus such definition is inapplicable here. 1 no petition for review was filed or review granted in esparza, which came from the sixth appellate district. in a subsequent sixth appellate district case, the majority noted that esparza was the only extant decision on this issue and rejected its conclusion. (people v. cordova (2016) 248 cal.app.4th 543, 552, fn. 8, review granted aug. 31, 2016, s236179 (cordova).) in granting review in cordova, the court deferred further action pending resolution of a related issue in chaney, supra, s223676, and valencia, supra, s223825. we decline to consider the cordova majority opinion persuasive on this point. (cal. rules of court, rules 8.1105, 8.1115.) 4 disposition the order is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. _____________________, acting p. j. ashmann-gerst we concur: _______________________, j. chavez _____________________, j. hoffstadt
