(undesignated statutory 4 references are to the penal code.) the court found all of the allegations true, but struck the prior prison term enhancements. it sentenced defendant to a second strike term of six years for the robbery, plus five years for the section 667, subdivision (a)(1) enhancement. the court stayed the sentence on the other two counts pursuant to section 654. discussion 1. sufficiency of evidence of robbery robbery is defined as the taking of personal property of some value, however the intent to permanently deprive the person of the property. ( 211; people v. marshall (1997) 15 cal.4th 1, 34.) defendant contends there was insufficient evidence of force or fear to support his robbery conviction. to resolve this issue, we review the whole record in the light most favorable to the judgment to decide whether substantial evidence supports the conviction, so that a reasonable jury could find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. (people v. tully (2012) 54 cal.4th 952, 1006.) ce that is reasonable, credible and of solid valuesuch that a reasonable trier of fact could find the defendant guilty beyond ibid.) we presume the existence of every fact supporting the judgment that the jury could reasonably deduce from the evidence and make all reasonable inferences that support the judgment. (people v. barnes (1986) 42 cal.3d 284, 303; people v. catlin (2001) 26 cal.4th 81, 139.) when reviewing a claim the trial court erred by denying a motion for acquittal under section 1118.1, we apply the same standard as when evaluating the sufficiency of evidence to support a conviction, except that we consider only the evidence in the record at the time the motion was made. (people v. augborne (2002) 104 cal.app.4th 362, 371; people v. smith (1998) 64 cal.app.4th 1458, 1464.) people v. garcia 5 (1996) 45 cal.app.4th 1242, 1246, disapproved on another ground in people v. mosby (2004) 33 cal.4th 353, 365, fns. 2, 3.) but the degree of force is immaterial; all that is (garcia, at p. 1246; people v. jones (1992) 2 cal.app.4th 867, 870.) property from another person, who resists the effort to do so, the crime is robbery, not people v. burns (2009) 172 cal.app.4th 1251, 1257.) whether the evidence demonstrates a use of force or fear is a factual question. (people v. mungia (1991) 234 cal.app.3d 1703, 1707.) in determining whether force was used, the trier of fact may consider and compare the physical characteristics of the victim and the defendant. (id. at p. 1709.) defendant used force to take the ring. notably, the jury was able to observe the relative she and defendant did during their struggle over the ring. we further note that defendant implicitly acknowledged his greater strength when cross-examined by the prosecutor, defendant repeatedly argues that he used surprise, not force, to obtain the ring. defendant may have hoped to obtain the ring merely by surprise, but when derian physically resisted his attempt to grab the ring, he used force to overcome her resistance, breaking two of her fingernails in the process. accordingly, motion. 2. failure to instruct, sua sponte, that defendant could not be convicted of both robbery and grand theft defendant contends that the trial court erred by failing to instruct, sua sponte, that defendant could not be convicted of both the greater offense of robbery and the lesser 6 included offense of grand theft, and that in order to convict him of grand theft, it must ould have properly ury the amount of force required for a defendant may not be convicted of both a greater offense and a necessarily included offense based upon the same set of facts. (people v. sanchez (2001) 24 cal.4th 983, 987.) of a lesser included offense is an implied acquittal of the offense charged when the jury returns a verdict of guilty of only the lesser included offense. [citation.] when the jury expressly finds defendant guilty of both the greater and lesser offense, however, there is no implied acquittal of the greater offense. if the evidence supports the verdict as to a greater offense, the conviction of that offense is controlling, people v. moran (1970) 1 cal.3d 755, 763 (moran).) theft is a lesser offense that is necessarily included within robbery. (people v. bradford (1997) 14 cal.4th 1005, 1055.) to avoid double jeopardy issues, a jury may be instructed that it must acquit on a greater offense before it can return a verdict on a lesser offense (people v. kurtzman (1988) 46 cal.3d 322, 329 (kurtzman)), and the california supreme court has encouraged trial courts to so instruct at the outset of deliberations (people v. fields (1996) 1instructing the jury pursuant to kurtzman (fieldsinclusive offense, while indicating they have reached a verdict on a lesser included ibid.), such an instruction need not be given sua sponte. here, no such deadlock occurred. accordingly, the trial court was not required to give such an instruction. 7 in addition, a kurtzman -homicide kurtzman instruction in the calcrim standard instructions is calcrim no. 3519, which sif all of you find that the defendant is not guilty of a greater charged crime, you may find (him/her) guilty of a lesser crime if you are convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty of that lesser crime. a defendant may not be convicted of both a greater and lesser crime for the same conduct. [] [now i will explain to you which charges are affected by this instruction:] [] [<insert crime>, as charged in count __, is a lesser crime to <insert crime> [as charged in count __.]] [] . . . [] it is up to you to decide the order in which you consider each greater and lesser crime and the relevant evidence, but i can accept a verdict of guilty of the lesser crime only if you have found the defendant not gnothing in calcrim no. 3519 identifies, compares, or contrasts any elements of the greater and lesser crimes. defendant cites calcrim no. 3516; people v. allen (1999) 21 cal.4th 846, 851; and people v. jaramillo (1976) 16 cal.3d 752, 757, in support of his claim, but these cases and calcrim no. 3516 pertain to convictions of inconsistent alternative charges that do not constitute greater and lesser included offenses, such as a theft offense and receiving stolen property. the bench notes to calcrim no. 3516 (2013 ed.) at page 986 state, if the case involves separately charged greater and lesser offenses, the court should give calcrim no. 3519. ical constituted an admission of guilt of grand theft and second degree burglary. in argument, ther defendant used force to take the ring. in response, defendant argued, based upon his own testimony, he did not use force or fear. thus, it could not possibly have been made more clear to the jury that the sole issue in dispute was whether defendant used force. 8 to the extent defendant argues that the trial court should have elaborated upon the term has no technical meaning peculiar to the law. (people v. anderson (1966) 64 cal.2d 633, 639640.) it was, nonetheless, error for the trial court to enter judgment upon both the greater (robbery) and lesser included (grand theft) convictions. this error is easily solved by reversing the conviction for the lesser included offense. (people v. sanders (2012) 55 cal.4th 731, 736.) 3. failure to instruct, sua sponte, pursuant to dewberry when the evidence is sufficient to support a conviction of both the offense charged and a lesser included offense, the trial court must instruct the jurors that if they have a reasonable doubt as to which offense has been committed, they must convict only of the lesser offense. (people v. dewberry (1959) 51 cal.2d 548, 555 (dewberry).) such an instruction must be given sua sponte. (people v. crone (1997) 54 cal.app.4th 71, 76.) this requirement applies even if both the greater and lesser offense are charged. (id. at p. 78.) failure to so instruct is subject to harmless error analysis under people v. watson (1956) 46 cal.2d 818, 836. (crone, at p. 78.) we asked the parties to submit letter briefs addressing the issue of whether the trial court erred by failing to instruct, sua sponte, pursuant to dewberry, supra, 51 cal.2d at page 555, with respect to the robbery and grand theft charges, and, if the court so erred, whether the error was prejudicial. defendant argued in his letter brief that the trial court prejudicially erred by failing to so instruct, while the attorney general argued in her letter brief that any error was harmless. we necessarily conclude that the trial court erred by failing to instruct, sua sponte, pursuant to dewberry, supra, 51 cal.2d at page 555, with respect to the robbery and grand theft charges. nonetheless, we conclude the error was harmless. the jury was 9 easonable doubt, the people must prove that: [] 1. the defendant took property that was not his own; [] fear to take the property or to prevent the person from resisting; [] and [] 5. when the defendant used force or fear to take the property, he intended to deprive the owner of u are able to reach a unanimous decision on only one or only some of the charges, fill in those verdict forms only, and notify the bailiff. return any instructions. (people v. williams (2010) 49 cal.4th 405, 469.) we further presume that jurors are intelligent and capable of understanding and correlating all jury instructions given. (people v. kegler (1987) 197 cal.app.3d 72, 80.) accordingly, we conclude the jury understood that each charge was to be separately considered, it could return not guilty verdicts on some charges and guilty verdicts on other charges, and it could not return a guilty verdict on any given charge unless all jurors unanimously agreed that the prosecution had proved each element of the charge beyond a reasonable doubt. thus, the had proved every element of robbery, including the use of force or fear, beyond a reasonable doubt. there is no reasonable probability that, had the trial court given a dewberry instruction, defendant would have obtained a more favorable result with respect to the robbery charge. 10 disposition versed and may not be retried. the judgment is otherwise affirmed. the trial court is directed to prepare an amended abstract of judgment and forward a copy to the department of corrections and rehabilitation. not to be published. mallano, p. j. we concur: rothschild, j. johnson, j.
