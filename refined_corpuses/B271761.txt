filed 4/28/17 p. v. portillo ca2/3 not to be published in the official reports california rules of court, rule 8.1115(a), prohibits courts and parties from citing or relying on opinions not certified for publication or ordered published, except as specified by rule 8.1115(b). this opinion has not been certified for publication or ordered published for purposes of rule 8.1115. in the court of appeal of the state of california second appellate district division three the people, plaintiff and respondent, v. oswald portillo, defendant and appellant. b271761 (los angeles county super. ct. no. ba299877) appeal from an order of the superior court of los angeles county, william c. ryan, judge. affirmed. maggie shrout, under appointment by the court of appeal, for defendant and appellant. no appearance for plaintiff and respondent. _____________________ 2 on july 13, 2007, following a jury trial, oswald portillo was found guilty of first degree murder with gun use and gang enhancements (pen. code,  187, 12022.53, subd. (d), 186.22, subd. (b)),1 and on may 2, 2008, he was sentenced to prison for a term of 50 years to life. as part of his sentence, portillo was ordered to pay a $2,500 restitution fine. affirmed by this court in 2009.2 on february in the superior court, complaining that the trial court (ryan, j.) had unfairly imposed the $2,500 restitution fine without a hearing, and that defense counsel had been ineffective for not objecting to the fine or requesting a restitution hearing. the superior court (sandoval, j.) denied this petition on march 14, 2016, finding that a restitution hearing must be requested but that portillo had failed either to request such a hearing at sentencing or raise the issue on appeal. the counsel claim should have been raised at the time of his appeal, but addressed the merits anyway, concluding there was no resulting prejudice to portillo because the trial court had imposed only a $2,500 finewhereas the statutory guidelines at that time (see former  1202.4, subd. (b)(2).) portillo filed a timely appeal. 1 all further statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise specified. 2 3 we appointed counsel to represent portillo on appeal. after reviewing the record, counsel filed an opening brief requesting this court to independently review the record pursuant to the holding of people v. wende (1979) 25 cal.3d 436, 441. we directed counsel to send the record on appeal and a copy of the opening brief to portillo, and notified defendant he had 30 days within which personally to submit any contentions or issues that he wished us to consider. portillo did not file a supplemental brief. we are satisfied that appellate counsel has fully complied with her responsibilities and that no arguable appellate issue exists. (smith v. robbins (2000) 528 u.s. 259, 278 [120 s.ct. 746]; people v. kelly (2006) 40 cal.4th 106, 110.) it is clear from has confused section 1202.4, subd. (f), with section 1202.4, subd. (b). the arguments he makes, the cases he cites, and the portions of the restitution statute he references have to do with subdivision (f), which concerns victim restitution, a penalty which does indeed give a defendant the right to dispute, at a hearing, the amount of restitution ordered. ( 1202.4, subd. (f)(1).) however, as judge sandoval pointed out in denying portpetition, the $2,500 he ha (b)subdivision (f)and section 1202.4, subdivision (d) specifically be 3 the superior court also fairly noted that a hearing 3 this language appears in the current version of the statute, as well as in the version applicable when portillo committed his crime. 4 could have resulted in a $10,000 restitution fine rather than the $2,500 fine imposed by the sentencing court, and therefore portillo had failed to demonstrate the prejudice prong of an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. disposition the order is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports edmon, p. j. we concur: aldrich, j. lavin, j.
