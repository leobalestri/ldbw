(see people v. nelson (dec. 15, 2017, b282695).) while the appeal in case no. b282695 was pending, the trial court received two petitions for dismissal. defendants first petition was received on october 20, 2017, and the second on october 23, 2017. both petitions were on judicial council forms entitled petition for dismissal (pen. code,  17(b), 17(d)(2), 1203.4, 1203.4a, 1203.41, 1203.49). attached to the first petition was declaration in which he stated that the case should be dismissed for the 3 following reasons: the trial court violated unspecified court rules; the record of conviction is incomplete; defendant did not enter a plea in the case; defendant received ineffective assistance of counsel; and the record contains no evidence of a willful plea agreement. in his declaration attached to the second petition, defendant alleged the following reasons for his request for dismissal: (1) there is no longer an original record or original copy; (2) the original copy of the record was destroyed pursuant to government code 69955, subdivision (e);2 (3) and under federal penal and constitutional law, a contract or plea agreement is no longer binding if the contract or plea agreement has been destroyed or is invalid. on october 30, 2017, the trial court received a third petition, entitled, petition for expedited recall of sentence, which sought recall of defendants sentence and resentencing on the ground that the record and plea agreement and or alleged record and alleged plea agreement in the case of ga054045 is and has been destroyed. the petition further alleged that defendant should not be bound by the original judgment of conviction because the destruction of the original record and plea agreement rendered the alleged plea agreement invalid. on october 31, 2017, the court read and considered defendants petitions before denying the relief sought pursuant to sections 17, subdivisions (b) and (d)(2), 1203.4, 1203.4a, 1203.41, and 1203.49, on the ground that defendant was ineligible, as he had been convicted of robbery and sentenced to 2 government code 69955, subdivision (e) provides that reporters notes may be destroyed upon the order of the court after 10 years. regarding the effect of lost or destroyed reporters notes, see generally, people v. bills (1995) 38 cal.app.4th 953, 959. 4 state prison after violating his probation.3 the trial court denied the petition for expedited recall of sentence on the ground that it lacked jurisdiction to do so.4 the court also noted that the conviction in this case was admitted as a strike in case no. ga091321, at a time when the missing information was presumably available. defendant filed timely notices of appeal from the trial courts orders. we have examined the entire record and are satisfied that defendants appellate counsel has fully complied with her responsibilities and that no arguable issue exists. we conclude that defendant has, by virtue of counsels compliance with the wende procedure and our review of the record, received adequate and effective appellate review of the judgment entered against him in this case.
