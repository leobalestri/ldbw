(pen. code,  490.2, 1170.18.) garcia sought to reduce to a misdemeanor his felony conviction for obstructing or resisting an executive officer in violation of penal code section 69 (section 69). garcia did not seek the reduction to misdemeanors of any of the three other felony convictions he suffered, one of which was for the unlawful taking or driving of a vehicle in violation of vehicle code section 10851 (section 10851). nevertheless, in its order, the trial court referred to all four felony convictions, not just the section 69 conviction thapetition, and stated that none of the convictions was eligible for reduction to a misdemeanor under proposition 47. on appeal, garcia has abandoned the proposition 47 relief that he sought below and that the trial court denied: the reduction of his section 69 conviction. instead, garcia seeks proposition 47 relief that he did not seek below but that the trial court denied anyway: the reduction of his section 10851 conviction. we affirm the denial of proposition 47 relief on garcsection 69 conviction because garcia abandoned that claim on section 10851 conviction because that claim to the trial court. garcia thus may file a new proposition 47 petition seeking the reduction of his section 10851 conviction to a misdemeanor. we do not address whether 3 section 10851 convictions are eligible for reduction under proposition 47 because garcia raised that question for the first time on appeal.1 disposition denial of for the reduction of his section 69 felony conviction to a misdemeanor is affirmed. the reduction to a misdemeanor under proposition 47 of section 10851 felony conviction is reversed. small, j.* we concur: zelon, acting p. j. segal, j. 1 that question is currently pending before the california supreme court in a series of cases.
