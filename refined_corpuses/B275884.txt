( 211; people v. mccurdy (2014) 59 cal.4th 1063, 1104; people v. anderson (2011) 51 cal.4th 989, 994.) the trial court did not abuse its discretion by permitting amendment of the information to add a second count for the people v. bolden (1996) 44 cal.app.4th 707, 716.) the original information charged a or court may, at any stage of the proceedings, permit an amendment of an information to add another offense shown by the evidence at the preliminary hearing.

(see, e.g., people v. clark, supra, at p. 931.) the court gave an appropriate limiting instruction stating that the prior conviction could be considered only in evaluating credibility, and further advised that the fact a witness has been convicted of a felony does not necessarily destroy or impair his credibility. likewise, the trial court did not err by denying the defense evidence was probative and not unduly prejudicial. (see evid. code,  351, 210; people v. williams (2008) 43 cal.4th 584, 633-634; people v. williams (2013) 58 cal.4th 197, 270-271.) the trial court properly instructed on, inter alia, the elements of the offense, the lesser included offense of petty theft, and the reasonable doubt standard. instruction with calcrim no. 376 (possession of recently stolen property as evidence of a crime), over a defense objection, was not error. calcrim no. of guilt solely from conscious possession of recently stolen property but properly permits the jury to draw such an inference where people v. lopez (2011) 198 cal.app.4th 698, 712.) 8 disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports aldrich, j. we concur: edmon, p. j. goswami, j. judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
