(people v. livingston, supra, 53 cal.4th at p. 1170; see albillar, supra, 51 cal.4th at p. 60 re included the requirement that the crime to be enhanced be committed for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with a criminal increased punishment under the [gang enhancement statute] ].) 8 simpson concedes and his gang membership provided substantial evidence he committed the november 18 and november 20, 2012 offenses in association with other members of the project crips.

(cf. people v. sanchez (2016) 63 cal.4th 665, 675 [gang expert may relate information acquired through his or her training and experience but may not testify to case-specific out-of-court statements to support the opinion].) 9 promote, further, or assist criminal conduct by gang members.(albillar, supra, 51 cal.4th at p. 67; accord, people v. garcia (2017) 9 cal.app.5th 364, 379-380; people v. gonzales (2015) 232 cal.app.4th 1449, 1464-1465.) establishes that the defendant intended to and did commit the charged felony with known members of a gang, the jury may fairly infer that the defendant had the specific intent to promote, further, or assist criminal conduct by th(albillar, at p. 68; accord, people v. livingston, supra, 53 cal.4th at p. 1171.) there is ample evidence in this record that simpson was a member of the project crips and committed the crimes on november 18 and november 20, 2012 jointly with other gang members. that evidence alone is sufficient to support the verdict. 3. multiple sentencing errors compel remand for resentencing relying substantially on the recommendations made in the trial court committed numerous sentencing errors resulting in an unauthorized sentence. (see people v. cunningham (2001) 25 cal.4th 926, 1044-1045 [appellate court has obligation to correct unauthorized sentence whenever the error comes to its attention, whether or not the error was raised on appeal]; people v. dotson (1997) 16 cal.4th 547, 554, fn. 6; see generally people v. scott (1994) 9 not lawfully be imposed under any circumstance in the particular c 6 6 simpson was sentenced to life without the possibility of parole for special circumstance felony murder (count 1). the court stayed the firearm enhancement the jury found true on that 10 a. the court erred in staying the section 12022.53, subdivision (b), enhancement in connection with the special circumstance felony murder (count 1) the trial court sentenced simpson to an indeterminate term of life without the possibility of parole (lwop) for the special circumstance, first degree felony murder (count 1) and stayed the enhancement for personal use of a firearm ( 12022.53, subd. (b)) associated with that count, purportedly under section 654, that simpson had not been the shooter. the people argued a stay was necessary because they had dismissed the allegation under section 12022.53, subdivision (e)(1), that would have provided for vicarious liability for a principalrm. the reasoning and are flawed. count and imposed the 15-year minimum parole eligibility alternate penalty for the gang enhancement under section 186.22, subdivision (b)(5). for the robbery charged in count 2, the court imposed a consecutive principal determinate term of five years (the upper term), plus 10 years for the personal use of a firearm and, inexplicably, the alternate penalty under subdivision (b)(5) of section 186.22 for the gang enhancement on that count. in addition, the court imposed consecutive subordinate terms of eight months for the lewd conduct offense (count 3); four 16-month terms for first degree residential robbery (counts 4, 5, 6, and 7) plus four 40-month terms for the firearm enhancement related to each of those counts; two eight-month terms for the felon-in-possession of a firearm and ammunition (counts 9 and 10); and two one-year terms for second degree robbery (counts 11 and 12) along with two 40-month terms for personal use of a firearm in connection with those robbery counts. the court stayed imposition of sentence on the burglary (count 8) pursuant to section 654. 11 simpson was tried as a perpetrator of the robbery of valadez or, alternatively, as an aider or abettor of that robbery. vamurder. although simpson did not shoot valadez, the jury found simpson had personally used a firearm while committing felony murdera finding supported by evidence he hit garcia on the head with his firearm thus facilitating the robbery of the market. (see  1203.06, subd. firearm in a menacing manner, to intentionally fire it, [or] to intentionally strike or hit a human being with it . . . ]; calcrim no. 3146 [incorporating definition of personal use from section 1203.06 for purposes of section 12022.53, subdivision (b)]; people v. johnson (1995) 38 cal.app.4th 1315, 1319.) accordingly, the section 12022.53, subdivision (b), firearm use enhancement should have been imposed.7 b. the court failed to impose gang enhancements on the murder (count 1) and robberies (counts 2, 11 and 12) the court also erred in failing to impose the 10-year gang enhancement for the felony murder and second degree robberies (counts 1, 2, 11 and 12) under section 186.22, subdivision (b)(1)(c), or to strike the additional punishment for the enhancement after making the findings specified in 7 found true by thfinding simpson personally used a firearm was supported by substantial evidence (as it plainly was here) or not. if the finding is not supported, the trial court should not impose the enhancement at all, not impose and stay its execution, as occurred here. 12 section 186.22, subdivision (g).8 as to count 1, the court found the alternate penalty in section 186.22, subdivision (b)(5), which imposes a minimum parole eligibility of 15 years on the commission of a felony punishable by a life sentence, applied to simpson-year enhancement in section 186.22, subdivision (b)(1)(c). this was error. (people v. lopez (2005) 34 cal.4th 1002, 1010 [the alternate penalty in section 186.22, subdivision (b)(5), applies to all life sentences except lwop]; people v. montes (2003) 31 cal.4th 350, 357.) the court also mistakenly believed the alternative penalty in section 186.22, subdivision (b)(sentence for the second degree robbery charged in count 2. however, simpson was sentenced to an upper, determinate term of five years on that count, not an indeterminate life termthe prerequisite for use of the alternate sentence provision in subdivision (b)(5). accordingly, simpson should have been sentenced to an additional 10 years on both counts 1 and 2 pursuant to section 186.22, subdivision (b)(1)(c). the trial court also failed to impose the gang enhancements the jury found true as to the second degree robberies charged in counts 11 and 12. neither the people nor the court proffered a reason for omitting those enhancements, and we find no support 8 the court did not make any explicit findings the interests of justice would not be served by imposing the gang enhancement as to any of the counts. (see  186.22, subd. (g) er law, the court may strike the additional punishment for the enhancements provided in this section . . . if the court specifies on the record and enters into the minutes the circumstances indicating that the interests of justice would be best served by t 13 for that decision in the record. to be sure, had the jury not found that simpson personally used a firearm in committing the offenses charged in those counts, it would have been error to impose both a vicarious gun enhancement and the gang enhancement. (see  12022.53, subd. (e)(2) [an enhancement for participation in a criminal street gang shall not be imposed . . . in addition to an enhancement imposed pursuant to this subdivision, unless the person personally used or personally but the jury found simpson had personally used a gun in committing the robberies in counts 11 and 12, and both enhancements should have been imposed. c. remand for resentencing is necessary in many instances we will modify a sentence to impose firearm or gang enhancements that were improperly stayed or omitted. however, when, as here, a sentence is composed of multiple elements as to which the trial court had some discretion (see, e.g.,  669 [vesting court with discretion to choose between concurrent and consecutive sentences]; 1170, subd. (b) [affording discretion to trial court to select among three statutorily authorized terms of imprisonment]), the more appropriate remedy is to remand to permit the trial court to reconsider all the components of the sentence. (see people v. salvador (2017) 11 cal.app.5th 584, 586-587 sentencing enhancement on multiple counts favored remand for resentencing rather than modification]; people v. bradley (1998) 64 cal.app.4th 386, 400-402 [remand for resentencing is 14 approdiscretion].)9 disposition the judgment of conviction is affirmed; the sentence is vacated, and the matter remanded for the limited purpose of allowing the trial court to resentence simpson in accordance with the principles expressed in this opinion. perluss, p. j. we concur: zelon, j. segal, j. 9 simpson also contends the trial court erred in imposing a parole revocation fine in light of his lwop sentence. because this issue, though moot in light of our remand, is likely to be raised at resentencing, we note imposition of the parole also includes determinate terms or indeterminate life terms with the possibility of parole. (people v. brasure (2008) 42 cal.4th 1037, 1075 [parole revocation fine proper when defendant, in addition to being sentenced to death, was also sentenced to an unstayed separate determinate prison term]; cf. people v. mcwhorter (2009) 47 cal.4th 318, 380 [parole revocation fine improper when defendant sentenced to death and no determinate term].)
