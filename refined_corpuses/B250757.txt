(b)-(i), 1170.12, subds. (a)-(d)) and had served one separate prison term for a felony (pen. code,  667.5, subd. (b)). garcia pleaded not guilty to the charges and denied the special allegations. the trial court granted garciaconviction allegations. a jury convicted garcia on all counts. prior to sentencing, garcia waived his right to a jury trial and admitted the prior conviction allegations. the trial court heard and denied his motion to dismiss his prior strike conviction pursuant to people v. superior court (romero) (1996) 13 cal.4th 497. the court sentenced garcia to an aggregate state prison term of seven years and four months, consisting of six years (the middle term of three years, doubled pursuant to the three strikes law) for driving or taking a vehicle with a prior felony theft conviction involving a vehicle, and one year and four months (one-third of the middle term of two years, doubled) for evading a pursuing police officer. the court stayed imposition of 3 sentence on the remaining counts pursuant to penal code section 654 and struck the one-year prior prison term enhancement in the interests of justice (id.,  1385). the court awarded garcia presentence custody credit consisting of 342 days (171 actual days and 171 days of conduct credit). the court ordered garcia to pay a $40 court security fee and a $30 criminal conviction assessment on each count, a $50 lab fee, a $280 restitution fine, and victim restitution to joseph cisneros in an amount to be determined. the court imposed and suspended a parole revocation restitution fine pursuant to penal code section 1202.45. discussion we appointed counsel to represent garcia on appeal. after an examination of the record, counsel filed an opening brief raising no issues. on february 4, 2014 we advised garcia that he had 30 days to submit any contentions or issues he wished us to consider. we have not received a response. we have examined the record and are satisfied that garciaon appeal has fully complied with the responsibilities of counsel and that there are no arguable issues. (see smith v. robbins (2000) 528 u.s. 259, 277-284 [120 s.ct. 746, 145 l.ed.2d 756]; people v. kelly (2006) 40 cal.4th 106, 118-119; people v. wende (1979) 25 cal.3d 436, 441.) although the trial court orally struck the one-year prior prison term enhancement (pen. code,  667.5, subd. (b)), the abstract of judgment erroneously shows the trial court stayed the enhancement. therefore, we order the trial court to correct the abstract of judgment by deleting the reference to this enhancement. (see people v. jones (2012) 54 cal.4th 1, 89; people v. myles (2012) 53 cal.4th 1181, 1222, fn. 14.)1 1 according to abstract of judgment reflecting the imposition of the upper term rather than the middle term as the base term for driving or taking a vehicle with a prior felony theft conviction involving a vehicle. 4 disposition the judgment is affirmed. the superior court is directed to prepare and forward to the department of corrections and rehabilitation a corrected abstract of judgment that deletes the one-year prior prison term enhancement. segal. j.* we concur: woods, acting p. j. zelon, j. * judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
