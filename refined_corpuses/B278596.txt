(a)),1 two counts of resisting an executive officer 1 statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise specified. 3 ( 69), and three counts of battery by gassing ( 243.9, subd. (a)), crimes he committed while incarcerated in county jail. (people v. smith (feb. 24, 2012, b223181) [nonpub. opn.] at p. 2 (smith i) affirmed in people v. smith (2013) 57 cal.4th 232 (smith ii).) were his, but argued that three of them were not strikes within the scope of four were strikes. [smith] moved [under section 1385 and people v. superior court (romero) 13 cal.4th 497 (romero)] to dismiss the strike findings. the court denied the motion and sentenced defendant to six consecutive third-strike terms of 25 years to life, smith i, supra, at pp. 5-6.) we affirmed the judgment, but abuse of discretion, we ded the case for resentencing.2 (smith i, supra, at p. 21.) upon our review of the record, we conclude[d] that the trial court abused its discretion by failing to consider several very y of incarceration in county jail and mental illness, and the relatively minor nature of the commitment offenses. in addition, the 2 in its minute order indicating its proposed sentence for smith, the trial court stated that in smith i ruled that the trial court did abuse its discretion. (smith i, suprawe find that 4 variety of ways in which it could exercise its discretion to impose (ibid.to romerodiscussed in our opinion. (ibid.) resolve a conflict among the courts (smith ii, supra, 57 cal.4th at p. 239.) the supreme court issued its opinion on july 18, 2013 and its remittitur to the court of appeal on august 26, 2013. we remitted the case to the trial court on august 30, 2013. on september 6, 2013, department 125 forwarded our remittitur to department 129 for further action. the next action we can discern from the record is that the case was called in department 130 (because department 129 was dark) on september 3, 2014 and continued to september 18, 2014 in department 129. resentencing was eventually continued until more than three years after we issued our remittitur: september 18, 2014: continued to september 24, 2014; september 24, 2014: continued to october 28, 2014; october 28, 2014: continued to november 5, 2014; november 5, 2014: continued to december 17, 2014; december 17, 2014: continued to january 23, 2015; january 23, 2015: set for status conference on march 4, 2015 and resentencing on march 18, 2015; march 4, 2015: march 18 resentencing advanced and vacated, matter continued to april 8, 2015; april 8, 2015: continued to may 19, 2015; 5 may 19, 2015: continued to june 9, 2015; june 9, 2015: continued to june 19, 2015; june 19, 2015: continued to july 21, 2015; july 21, 2015: continued to september 10, 2015; september 10, 2015: continued to october 15, 2015; october 15, 2015: continued to november 24, 2015; november 24, 2015: continued to january 20, 2016; january 20, 2016: continued to february 25, 2016; february 25, 2016: continued to april 20, 2016; april 20, 2016: continued to may 24, 2016; may 24, 2016: continued to june 29, 2016. on june 29, 2016, the trial court heard testimony from gwendolyn vontoure, a nurse who treated smith on april 11, 2006, when he was in administrative segregation. smith had exposed himself to vontoure and threatened to kill her upon his release. after vontoure testified, the romero motion and informed the parties of its proposed sentence. on october 12, 2016, the trial court reduced counts 2 through 6 (two counts of resisting an executive officer and three counts of battery by gassing) to misdemeanors and sentenced smith to an indeterminate sentence of 25 years to life on count 1 (custodial possession of a weapon) and to six months each concurrent on counts 2 through 6. discussion a. smith was entitled to be present for resentencing smith was not present for any of the hearings the trial court held after we issued our remittitur. smith contends and the people concede that smith was entitled to be present at his 6 resentencing and that he did not waive that right. the people s error was harmless. repeatedly, beginning on september 24, 2014to be here and [section 977] seems to say that on sentencing and resentencing that the defendant must be here, should be authority that says i must have him here i will comply, but i hem on a remittitur present in court for his sentencing. again on november 24, 2015. the people raised the issue (in the context of potential proposition 36 proceedings), explaining to the trial cwritten or the defendant had to be present for resentencing. the trial court 7 increasin at the june 29, 2016 hearing where the trial court took romero motion, the trial court noted multiple times that smith was not present. the trial court made the same observation when it imposed sentence on dewone smith. he is not present before the court, currently serving a prison sentence but here on sentencing hearing and formalization of an order concerning a motion filed by defense statement of the law reflects a foundational misunderstanding of the disposition of smith i. to be clear, we vacated sentence. our supreme court has clarified that remand for [t]hat a sentencing remand necessarily entails a full resentencing people v. buckhalter (2001) 26 cal.4th 20, 35 (buckhaltercourt has the power, when a trial court has made a mistake in inevitably require all of the procedural steps involved in people v. rodriguez (1998) 17 cal.4th 253, 258.) (buckhalter, supra, 26 cal.4th at p. 23.) we vacated the sentence. (smith i, supra, b223181 at pp. 21-22.) when we did [smith] to the same position as if he had never buckhalter, supra, 26 cal.4th at p. 34; van velzer v. superior court (1984) 152 cal.app.3d 742, 744.) it 8 was, therefore not accurate that the trial court was going to reduce a pre-existing sentence; there was no sentence to reduce. except under certain circumstances not relevant all cases in which a felony is charged, the accused shall be personally present at the arraignment, at the time of plea, during the preliminary hearing, during those portions of the trial when evidence is taken before the trier of fact, and at the time of the imposition of sentence. statutory requirement that a criminally accused be personally present in court applies to all proceedings where his presence people v. thompson (2016) 1 cal.5th 1043, 1099.) we agree with both smith and the people that the trial court erred when it refused to allow smith to be present for resentencing. s error was harmless. according to the people, the error is a state law error, and not an people argue th it is reasonably probable that a result more favorable to the appealing party would have been reached in the absence of error.(citing people v. davis (2005) 36 cal.4th 510, 532-533.) smith points out, however, that in davis, the supreme court stated ultimately expressly applied the test for prejudicial error that the united states supreme court set out in chapman v. california 9 can be held harmless, the court must be able to declare a belief we agree with smith. the trial coupresence at his resentencing implicates both his statutory and constitutional due process rights. given that the people elicited substantial testimony related to whether he should be given an indeterminate sentence, the failure may have implicated his confrontation clause rights under both the federal and state constitutions doubt. (people v. simms (2018) 23 cal.app.5th 987, 998 (simms).) the people have not even attempted to show that the trial smith, on the other hand, pointed out a variety of ways that he was riginal sentencing hearing, smith had actively participated with his counsel and produced evidence regarding his background and mental illness, which we ordered the trial court to consider on remand. and given the arguments the people invoked in the trial court the time of the offenses, smith could likely have shed a great deal of light on whether and how he was being treated or whether he was merely being observed for a competency determination after he had been ordered remanded to state prison.3 3 based on the record before us in smith i, we were deeply concerned with smithafter a trial court order that he be remanded to state prison 10 mental health treatment the state prison system could have provided him was a significant factor in our decision to vacate (smith i, supra, b223181 at p. 4.) in the trial court, the people argued repeatedly and exhaustively both in writing and defendant is ordered to be transported to state prison the people based the argument on several things, including (captioned , in which the trial court admittedly transported to state p presumably, the people believe that certain words on the the trial court particularly disturbing in light of the fact that the nscript specifiestwicethat the trial court is sentencing smith to a state prison sentence. we reviewed our files to determine whether the people had filed either a petition for rehearing (cal. rules of court, rule 8.268(b)) or a motion to recall the remittitur (cal. rules of court, rule 8.272(c)) in smith i, both means by which the people could have sought to have our error corrected if our opinion was erroneous. the people filed neither a petition for rehearing nor a motion to recall the remittitur. (and the was based on documents showing that smith was being held for a competency determination in another matter and disproportionately speculation about the logistics of what happens after a defendant is referred for a competency determination. we are very 11 may, or may not, have chosen to believe what [smith] might have said, if he said anything, but we cannot conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that his presence at the hearing would not have simms, supra, 23 cal.app.5th at p. 998.) address remaining merits arguments. b. transfer to a different judge smith requests pursuant to code of civil procedure section 170.1, subdivision (c) that on remand, his case be assigned to a different judge for resentencing. we agree that the case should be transferred to a different trial judge and will order the transfer. code of civil procedure section 170.1, subdivision (c) states: shall consider whether in the interests of justice it should direct that further proceedings be heard before a trial judge other than the judge whose judgment or order was reviewed by the appellate under code of civil procedure section 170.1, subdivision (c), should be exercised sparingly, and only if the interests of justice hernandez v. superior court (2003) 112 cal.app.4th 285, 303.) (people v. lablanc (2015) 238 cal.app.4t concrequest that we correct our opinion or to produce evidence regarding the way in which it contends we were incorrect may have invited further error by the trial court. 12 judicial error does not establish bias and normally is not a proper ibid.) after our remittitur, this case languished in the trial court for more than three years before smith was resentenced. that is true even though the only felony for which smith was ultimately resentenced was punishable by two, three, or four years had the trial court exercised its discretion in any number of ways. ( 4502, subd. (a).) smith repeatedly and fervently objected to the to counsel what i may expect from them in supporting their of this. just for the record this has got to be the last continuance. [] . . . [] because mr. smith is threatening me with habeas on a whole now at the point where the system is still failing [smith]. we 13 have had continuance after continuance and some of them are justified because of personal issues with the court, but the system the court inthe trial court responded that it understood. the three-year delay between remittitur and resentencing here was unconscionable. the record does not disclose the cause of the vast majority of the more-than-20 continuances. but unless the trial court had already determined when it first started continuing resentencing in this case that it was going to sentence smith to more than the length of the continuances (taken together with whatever custody and other credits smith was entitled to), then the delay had the very real possibility of to be resentenced before a different trial judge. 14 disposition the sentence is vacated and the matter is remanded to the trial court for resentencing. defendant is entitled to be present at that hearing. on remand, the trial court is ordered to assign the case to a judge other than judge jose i. sandoval for resentencing consistent with this opinion and our opinion in no. b223181. not to be published. chaney, acting p. j. we concur: bendix, j. currey, j. judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
