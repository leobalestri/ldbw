(a)(2)). the complaint also alleged that hawkins had previously served a separate prison term for a felony, and he had not remained free of prison custody for a period of five years ( 667.5, subd. (b)). on september 25, 2013, hawkins entered into a negotiated plea agreement, under which he pleaded no contest to count 1 of the complaint for first degree burglary and admitted the one-year prior alleged pursuant to section 667.5, subdivision (b). the court sentenced hawkins to a five-year prison sentence, imposing the four-year middle term for 1 unless otherwise stated, further statutory references are to the penal code. 3 first degree burglary and one year for the prior prison term enhancement. as part of the allegation as to count 1, and the remaining counts and allegations. b. the restitution hearing a restitution hearing was held on november 13, 2013. the hearing was that hawkins should pay bolanos $986.54 for the ipad2 based on the original purchase price, $401.03 for the gun, and $1,500 cash, for a total of $2,887.57. as to the ipad2, hawkins asserted that bolanos was only entitled to recover the cost of replacing the stolen ipad2 with a new one. hawkinss counsel offered to stipulate that hawkins would because the ipad2 was no longer available. however, hawkins never provided any evidence to the court as to the actual cost of a new ipad, only asserting that it would be less than the initial $986 cost of ipad2. s counsel suggested that he could get the cost information from apple, stating in response, the trial judge indicated she intended to order hawkins to pay bolanos what he paid for the ipad2s counsel then requested a hearing. the people proceeded to call bolanos to testify about his loss. on direct examination, the prosecutor showed bolanos a six-page document that included receipts for the ipad2 and the gun. after reviewing the document, bolanos testified he had purchased the gun for $401, and that the missing $1,500 in cash was part of a $2,310 check bolanos had received in february 2013. the value of the gun and missing cash are not before us. as to the ipad2, bolanos testified that he purchased it in approximately november 2011 for $986, including taxes. at the time it was stolen, the ipad2 was functioning properly and had no dents or marks on it. bolanos had placed a cover on the ipad, but the price of the cover was not included in the $986. after it was stolen, bolanos did not look for a replacement ipad or at prices for a new ipad. when asked whether he could buy a ide 4 hawkins failed to provide any evidence to the court as to the current purchase price of a replacement ipad, instead seeking to elicit this information from bolanos s testimony that he had no knowledge of current ipad prices. c. during the course of s testimony, defense counsel asserted numerous objections, each of which was overruled by the court. s direct troduction of the six-page document with receipts citing due process grounds on the basis that he had not previously seen the s attorney to review the document while bolanos testified. hawkis counsel also objected to the receipts ,2 which the court overruled. s counsel s testimony about the purchase price of the ipad2 as vague and a violation of due process on the basis that bolanos first testified that the receipt showed a cost of $468, then $968, and then he corrected himself to say 3 the trial court overruled the objections.4 on cross-examination, tgoing to the value of the ipad2 at the time it was stolen after bolanos testified that he did not look at prices for a replacement ipad. s counsel to make an offer of proof as to the s testimony on the cost of a new ipad. the court also made several comments expressing frustration with s counsel. for example, after cutting off cross-s knowledge of the value of his ipad at the time it was stolen, when counsel continued to 2 the receipt had been downloaded from the ipad2 before it was stolen. 3 4 court shifting the burden of proof to hawkins to counter the evidence of loss, and it cut off questioning as to ducation on relevance grounds. 5 argue his position, the trial court stated: after further inquiry about the value of the gun and the amount of money that had been stolen-examination. the court stated: [$]2,not allow any argument by counsel. discussion a. judicial misconduct 1. hawkins waived his right to object to asserted judicial misconduct hawkins contends the trial court committed judicial misconduct in the manner in which it conducted the restitution hearing. while hawkins does not dispute that he failed to object on this basis below, he claims his failure to object is excused because any objection would have been futile. where counsel does not complain or object that evidentiary rulings reflect judicial bias, the party forfeits the claim on appeal. (people v. pearson (2013) 56 cal.4th 393, 447; people v. snow (2003) 30 cal.4th 43, 77-78.) one exception to this general rule is where objecting would be futile. (see people v. sturm (2006) 37 cal.4th 1218, 1237 [finding it would have been futile for defendant to raise with the judge his derogatory comments and objections where it could cause the judge to be more negative toward defendant in front of the jury].) s counsel failed to raise any objections with the court as to asserted judicial misconduct. while it is true that raising a concern with the trial judge that she was being biased against hawkins or his counsel would likely not have changed raised this by filing a motion to disqualify the judge under code of civil procedure sections 170.1 and 170.3, which he failed to do. (see people v. scott (1997) 15 cal.4th 6 1188, 1207 [finding waiver of objection to lack of impartiality where attorney failed to seek disqualification under code of civil procedure section 170.3].) 2. the trial court did not commit judicial misconduct while hawkins forfeited his claim of judicial misconduct, we nevertheless find that the court did not commit any acts of judicial misconduct. a court commits misconduct if it creates the impression that it is denigrating the defense, making discourteous and disparaging remarks to defense counsel, or otherwise allying itself with the prosecution. (people v. blacksher (2011) 52 cal.4th 769, 824; people v. snow, supra, 30 cal.4th at p. 78.) however, even where a trial court makes comments that are better left unsaid,defendant a fair trial or hearing. (snow, supra, at pp. 78, 82 of a fair trial].) hawkins contends the trial judge was biased against the defense given her as shown by her overruling defense ng his cross-examination of bolanos. even when erroneousdo not establish a people v. guerra (2006) 37 cal.4th 1067, 1112, disapproved on another ground in people v. rundle (2008) 43 cal.4th 76, 151; see also people v. pearson, supra, 56 cal.4th at p. 447.) in this case, s against hawkins on objections do not rise to the level of bias. neither -examination of bolanos constitute misconduct, s counsel was seeking to inquire as to the cost to purchase a new ipad after bolanos testified he had no knowledge of the price of a new ipad. (see evid. code,  the testimony of a witness concerning a particular matter is likewise, while the court at time expressed impatience with defense counsel, the court did not display any overt bias toward hawkins or his counsel that would constitute misconduct. (people v. snow, supra, 30 cal.4th at p. 79.) 7 b. restitution award hawkins contends that the restitution order should be reversed because the trial court erred in awarding bolanos the original purchase price of the ipad 2. 1. governing law on restitution have a right to recover restitution directly from persons convicted of the crimes for losses they suffer. (cal. const., art. i,  28, subd. (b)(13)(b); people v. giordano (2007) 42 cal.4th 644, 652.) it wrongdoer in every case, regardless of the sentence or disposition imposed, in which a (cal. const., art. i,  28, subd. (b)(13)(b).) section 1202.4, subdivision (f), similarly provides, in every case in which a victim has suffered the court shall require that the defendant make restitution to the victim or victims in an amount established by court order, based on the amount of loss claimed by the victim or victims or any other showing to the court. compelling and extra (ibid.) unequivocal intention that victim restitution be made, statutory provisions implementing the constitutional directive have been broadly and libera [citation.]people v. stanley (2012) 54 cal.4th 734, 737 was three times what victim paid for the truck 18 months earlier, finding it was appropriate to return truck to former condition]; see also luis m. v. superior court (2014) 59 cal.4th 300, 305.) once the victim makes a prima facie showing of economic defendant to demonstrate that the amount of loss is a different amount from that claimed by the victim. (people v. chappelone (2010) 183 cal.app.4th 1159, 1172; people v. prosser (2007) 157 cal.app.4th 682, 690-691.) 8 section 1202.4 provides for reimbursement for the value of stolen or damaged property. ( 1202.4, subd. (f)(3)(a).) as to the restitution amount, section 1202.4 provides that [t]he value of stolen or damaged property shall be the replacement cost of like propertyibid., italics added.) it is this language that hawkins relies upon in arguing that the replacement cost for the stolen ipad2 is less than what bolanos paid two years ago, citing people v. thygesen (1999) 69 cal.app.4th 988. in thygesen, the court held that the trial court should have ordered payment for a replacement used cement mixer where the stolen cement mixer was estimated to be 10 years old, stating: if [the victim] were a car rental agency that lost a 1995 ford taurus, it would be entitled to the replacement value of a similar 1995 ford taurus, not a 1999 people v. thygesen, supra, 69 cal.app.4th at p. 995.) s argument is that the used ipad2 cost more two years ago than what it would cost to replace it now with a new ipad, so the current price is the best estimate of replacement cost. in response, the people cite cases where courts have used the purchase price of the stolen item as an approximation of replacement cost in the absence of other evidence. (see, e.g., people v. foster (1993) 14 cal.app.4th 939, 943, 946 [upholding valuation of stolen persian rug at $8,000 purchase price]; in re brian s. (1982) 130 cal.app.3d 523, 532 value for stolen items].) as we explain below, the trial court properly used this measure of replacement cost based on the evidence before it. 2. standard of review we review restitution order for abuse of discretion. (people v. giordano, supra, 42 cal.4th at p. 663.) broad discretion to choose a method for calculating the amount of restitution, it must employ 9 ecid. at pp. 663-664; see also people v. chappelone, supra, 183 cal.app.4th at p. 1173.) 3. the trial court did not abuse its discretion by using the initial purchase price of the ipad2 in this case, the people made a prima facie s economic loss for the ipad2 based on his testimony and the receipt reflecting a purchase price of $986. bolanos testified that his ipad was functioning properly and had no dents or other damage. thus, as in foster and brian s., the purchase price of the ipad2 provided a fair approximation of the cost to buy a new ipad to replace the stolen ipad2. (see people v. foster, supra, 14 cal.app.4th at p. 946; in re brian s., supra, 130 cal.app.3d at p. 532.) once bolanos made a prima facie showing of his economic loss, the burden shifted to hawkins to disprove the amount of the loss. (see people v. chappelone, supra, 183 cal.app.4th at p. 1172.) hawkins relies on the language of section 1202.4, subdivision (f), which requires ,value for the ipad2 in this case should be based on the lower price of a new ipad, and not on the amount bolanos paid for his ipad2. this argument would be persuasive if hawkins submitted any evidence to the court showing that the cost to replace the stolen ipad2 with a new comparable ipad was less than the $986 initially paid by bolanos. but hawkins failed to present any evidence, instead offering only tthe price of a replacement ipad.5 5 hawkins also relies on people v. chappelone, supra, 183 cal.app.4th at pages 1175-1176, for its holding that a victim should not obtain a windfall from restitution. in chappelone, the court reversed a restitution award to target based on the last retail price of the stolen items, where the stolen items had been damaged or discounted for sale. however, absent evidence of a lower purchase price for a new ipad, hawkins cannot support his claim that bolanos would gain a windfall from recovery of his initial purchase price for the ipad2. 10 hawkins argues that the trial court prevented him from continuing to cross-examine bolanos as to the replacement cost of the ipad2. but bolanos had already testified that he did not look into prices for a replacement, and that he had no idea whether a new ipad would cost less than what he had paid. thus, bolanos could only speculate as to whether a new ipad would cost less than his stolen ipad2. (see aguilar v. atlantic richfield co. petroleum companies conspired to raise gasoline prices by restricting supply, holding, ]; carlsen v. koivumaki (2014) 227 cal.app.4th 879, 889, 892 [holding speculation as to what caused victim to fall off cliff was not evidence sufficient to create triable issue of material fact, affirming grant of summary adjudication of assault and battery claim].) s counsel in his reply court wanted to comply with the law regarding determining replacement cost, it would have been a very simple and quick thing to do by logging on to the apple website to it was not the job of the trial court to research the price of a new ipad, nor would it have been proper. rather, the court acted within its discretion in ordering restitution based on the evidence before it, in this case, the purchase price of the ipad 2. 11 disposition the order is affirmed. feuer, j.* we concur: perluss, p. j. zelon, j. * judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
