(a)) and one count of attempted premeditated murder ( 187 & 664, subd. (a)), and alleged several firearm enhancements and special circumstances with respect to the murders. a jury convicted defendant of the first degree murder of the 73-year-old man and of the friend defendant tracked down; of the second degree murder of the friend defendant shot 37 times; and of the attempted premeditated murder of the pedestrian. the jury found two special circumstances justifying a sentence of life without the possibility of parolenamely, that defendant committed multiple murders and that the murder of the 73-year-old man occurred during a robbery. the jury also found that all 4 four offenses involved defendant( 12022.5, subd. (a)), and, as to the attempted murder, defendant personally inflicted great bodily injury ( 12022.7, subd. (a)) and discharged a firearm from a motor vehicle ( 12022.55). the trial court sentenced defendant to prison for 17 years plus four consecutive life sentences. the court calculated that sentence by: (1) sentencing defendant to life without the possibility of parole for the three murders, each with an additional four years for the personal use of a firearm; (2) sentencing defendant to life (with the possibility of parole) for the attempted premeditated murder, with an additional five years for the drive by shooting; and (3) running each of those sentences consecutively. modified his sentenced to substitute the life without the possibility of parole sentence for the friend defendant shot 37 times with a sentence of 15 years to life, plus the four-year firearm enhancement. sentence was 32 years to life (the 15-year sentence for the second by a life sentence and then two sentences of life without the possibility of parole. (people v. askew (jan. 26, 1999, b107911) [nonpub. opn.].) b. motions for resentencing, and resentencing in 2015, defendant filed (1) a petition for recall and resentencing pursuant to section 1170, subdivision (d)(2), and (2) a petition for a writ of habeas corpus seeking a resentencing pursuant to miller and montgomery. the court issued an 18-page tentative ruling detailing the procedural history of the case and 5 for resentencing. the court evaluated the evidence presented by defendant in his filings, considered the factors set forth in miller, and ultimately reimposed the same sentence as the original trial court because, in its view, irreparable corruption resulting in permanent incorrigibility, the trial court then held an evidentiary hearing. defendant presented the testimony of an expert witness on adolescent development. the court entertained extensive argument from the parties before taking the matter under submission. a few days later, defendant reaffirmed its tentative ruling instances where the defendant is irredeemably corrupt, and poses a continuing threat to the the a writ of habeas corpus, and reimposed the same sentence as the trial court (as corrected by the court of appeal). c. appeal defendant filed a timely notice of appeal. discussion both the united states and california constitutions prohibit the imposition of sentences so excessive that they and or the california constitution). (u.s. const., 8th amend., italics added; cal. const., art. i,  17, italics added; see people v. palafox (2014) 231 cal.app.4th 68, 82 [difference in conjunction does not translate to a different meaning when it comes to excessive sentences].) under these provisions, a sentence of life without 6 the possibility parole is unconstitutionally excessive if (1) imposed against a juvenile (that is, a person under the age of 18) for a crime other than a homicide (people v. contreras (2018) 4 cal.5th 349, 359); or (2) imposed against a juvenile for a homicide, unless a court determinesafter considering five factors enumerated by the united states supreme court2that unfortu(miller, supra, 567 u.s. at pp. 479-480, quoting roper v. simmons (2005) 543 u.s. 551, 573; montgomery, supra, 136 s.ct. at p. 734). possibility of parole on two of his first degree murder convictions, defendant argues that: (1) millers requirement that life without the against imposing such a sentence unless and until the people produce evidence that 2 those factors are: its hallmark featuresamong them, immaturity, impetuosity, homicide offense, including the extent of [the juvenile defendanticted of a lesser offense if not for incompetencies associated with youthfor example, his inability to deal with police officers or prosecutors . . . of people v. gutierrez (2014) 58 cal.4th 1354, 1388-1389, quoting miller, supra, 567 u.s. at pp. 477-478.) 7 rebuts that presumption (and here, defendant argues, the people did not); and (2) the finding offender whose crime reflects irreparable corrupfound by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt (rather than by a court) because it operates as a factual finding necessary to increase the statutory maximum of the offense (see apprendi v. new jersey (2000) 530 u.s. 466). the people assert that we amendment to section 3051 now permits defendants sentenced to life without the possibility of parole to seek parole after 25 years, which means he is no longer sentenced to life without the possibility of parole and thus moots out his constitutional challenge. we will address the threshold issue of mootness first. i. mootness as of january 1, 2018, section 3051 proclaims that a be eligible for release on parole . . . during his or her 25th year of incarceration at a youth offender parole hearing, unless previously released or [otherwise] entitled to an earlier parole consideration . . . .t has held that shearing to juveniles sentenced to sentences short of a life sentence [s] [the juvenile] with people v. franklin (2016) 63 cal.4th 261, 268-269 (franklin).) this logic applies with equal force to juveniles, like defendant, who were sentenced to life without the possibility of parole. (people v. lozano (2017) 16 cal.app.5th 1286, 1290-1292 [so holding], review granted feb. 21, 2018, s246013.) 8 defendant raises four arguments in response. first, he argues that his request for resentencing is based in california law, not federal law, and that sof a parole hearing after 25 years only moots out his claims based on federal law. we reject this argument because, as defendant in this area. second, defendant contends that a parole hearing 25 years from now cannot cure the injury he suffers by having an unconstitutionally excessive sentence imposed in the first place. however, the remedy that defendant seeks in his habeas petitionnamely, parole consideration after 25 yearsis precisely the remedy afforded by section 3051. section 3051 also requires the parole board to consider the very same factors from miller that defendant urges us to evaluate on appeal. (franklin, supra, 63 cal.4th at p. 268.) because section 3051 appears to give defendant all of the relief he seeks, his constitutional challenge is moot. defendant tries to distinguish himself from the defendant in franklin, reasoning that franklins sentence was lawful at the time it was imposed (because it was imposed before miller placed limitations on the length of juvenile sentences) while his sentence was unlawful at the time it was imposed (because the trial court resentenced him after miller and misapplied its factors). but whether his sentence was lawful or unlawful at the time it was imposed has no bearing on whether section 3051 affords him all the relief he seeks and therefore renders his constitutional challenge moot. third, defendant asserts that section 3051 does not moot out his constitutional challenges because, until his youth offender parole hearing occurs during his 25th year of incarceration, he is 9 still considered a prisoner under a sentence of life without the possibility of parole and, as such, is (1) currently entitled to fewer custody credits, and (2) subject to a higher security classification that limits his access to rehabilitative programs. although the collateral consequences of a court ruling can, in some circumstances, prevent an issue from becoming moot (people v. lindsey (1971) 20 cal.app.3d 742, 744 [prisoner who has . . . people v. deleon (2017) 3 cal.5th 640, 646, fn. 2). but defendant has not demonstrated that the collateral consequences he cites are sufficiently concrete at this point in time to overcome the mootness of his central claim. lastly, defendant argues that it is better for judges to apply the miller factors than for a parole board to do so imposition of sentence and the exercise of sentencing discretion are fundamentally and inherently judicial people v. clancey (2013) 56 cal.4th 562, 580.) were we to accept this argument, we would effectively be overruling our supreme franklin, that the youth offender parole hearings guaranteed by section 3051 moot out a defendaconstitutionally based request for resentencing by a court (franklin, supra, 63 cal.4th at pp. 268-269). this is not something we are allowed to do. (auto equity sales, inc. v. superior court (1962) 57 cal.2d 450, 455-456.) for these reasons, defenhowever, we will nevertheless address their merits. 10 ii. merits a. presumption against life without the possibility of parole resentencing rests on a two-step argument: (1) miller and montgomery erect a presumption against imposing a sentence of life without the possibility of parole on a juvenile convicted of a homicide offense; and (2) the people did not rebut that presumption because it introduced no evidence during the resentencing hearing. we need not grapple with whether the because the second step is not valid.3 when the law erects a rebuttable presumption, what matters is whether the evidence presented rebuts the presumption; who introduced that evidence is of no concern. (see cowell v. snyder presumption may be rebutted by evidence offered by either woosley v. state of california (1992) 3 cal.4th 758, 786 presumption rebuttable by one party and not the other, we believe it would have said sopeople introduced no evidence. and even if we assume that the rebuttable presumption against the imposition of life without the possibility of parole was error, that error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. as detailed in which included shooting an elderly man 3 the first issue was pending before our supreme court in people v. mendoza, review granted january 25, 2017, s238032, but was subsequently dismissed as moot in light of the amendment of section 3051 discussed above ( 3051, subd. (b)(4)). 11 to take his money, shooting a friend 37 times, and then tracking down and putting five bullets in the gut of the witness to that shootingwas all f peer pressure, was not prompted by a particularly bad upbringing, was not prompted by any mental or other illness, and until recently elicited no expression of remorse from defendant. viewing this evidence through the lens of a rebuttable presumption woand renders him a offender whose crime reflects irreparable b. jury findings beyond a reasonable doubt resentencing is the argument that a jurynot the courtshould have been the entity responsible for applying the miller factors and deciding whether the people had proven, beyond a offender[s] miller, supra, 567 u.s. at pp. 479-480). this argument was rejected in people v. blackwell (2016) 3 cal.app.5th 166, 192-194, and we agree with s analysis and conclusion. iii. abstract of judgment the abstract of judgment incorrectly reflects that defendant was sentenced to life without the possibility of parole on counts 1, 2, and 4. it should be corrected to reflect that defendant was sentenced to life with the possibility of parole on count 1. additionally, the abstract contains three factual errors. it states: (1) that defendant committed the first degree murder of robert hamilton (count 2) in 1998the crime was committed in 1993; (2) that defendant committed the second degree murder of 12 michael harris (count 3) in 1998the crime was committed in 1994; and (3) that defendant committed the first degree murder of eddie chillies (count 4) in 1998the crime was committed in 1994. the abstract should be corrected to reflect the true years the crimes were committed. disposition the appeal is dismissed. the trial court is directed to prepare an amended abstract of judgment to reflect that defendant was sentenced to life with the possibility of parole on count 1, that count 2 was committed in 1993, and that counts 3 and 4 were committed in 1994. the amended abstract of judgment is to be forwarded to the department of corrections and rehabilitation. not to be published in the official reports. ______________________, j. hoffstadt we concur: _________________________, p. j. lui _________________________, j. ashmann-gerst
