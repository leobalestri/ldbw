(in re pope (2010) 50 cal.4th 777, 779.) penal code section 2933.1,1 however, limits such credit to 15 percent of the prison term for any person convicted of a qualifying violent felony, which under section [a]ny felony in which the defendant inflicts great bodily injury . . . which has been charged and proved as provided for in section 12022.7. pursuant to a plea agreement, philip micah davis admitted he inflicted great bodily injury on a child under the age of five years during the commission of a felony, within the meaning of section 12022.7, subdivision (d). in this petition for writ of habeas corpus, he contends the department of corrections and rehabilitation nevertheless wrongly limited his worktime credit under section 2933.1, resulting in an improper extension of his release date. davis argues his admission to the section 12022.7 allegation cannot serve as the basis for limiting his worktime credit because, among other reasons, section 12022.7, subdivision (d), does not apply where, as here, infliction of great bodily injury is an element of the underlying offense. we agree, and grant petition. 1 undesignated statutory references are to the penal code. 3 factual and procedural background a. in february 2014, while leading police on a 10-minute car chase during which he drove the wrong way on the 405 freeway, davis collided with a vehicle carrying an infant girl and her parents, seriously injuring them all. davis was arrested and charged with three counts of assault with a deadly weapon ( 245, subd. (a)(1)), one count of attempting to elude a peace officer resulting in serious bodily injury (veh. code,  2800.3, subd. (a)), one count of attempting to elude a peace officer by driving with willful disregard for the safety of persons or property (id.,  2800.2, subd. (a)), and one count of driving the wrong way on a divided highway (id.,  21651, subd. (b)). on all counts, the people alleged davis personally inflicted great bodily injury on a child under the age of five years, within the meaning of section 12022.7, subdivision (d). pursuant to a plea agreement, davis pleaded no contest to the felony charge of attempting to elude an officer resulting in serious bodily injury, and he admitted the allegation that in committing the offense he personally inflicted great bodily injury on a child under the age of five years within the meaning of section 12022.7, subdivision (d). also pursuant to the plea agreement, the trial court sentenced davis to the low term of three years for attempting to elude an officer resulting in serious admission, and dismissed all other charges. the court set a surrender date in 60 days, to allow davis to complete a course of medical treatment. 4 b. davis davis began serving his prison term in may 2015. evidently because the abstract of judgment did not reflect that his conviction was for a violent felony or that he received a sentence enhancement under section 12022.7, the department initially classified davis as eligible to receive full worktime credit and calculated his earliest possible release date as june 21, 2016. on june 16, 2016, however, a department case records department had it was determined [he] should have only been receiving [15%] that same day, davis received written notice his release date was no longer june 21, 2016, but december 7, 2017. the notice pc davis filed administrative appeals with the department, arguing it improperly recalculated his worktime credit under section 2933.1 because he was not convicted of a qualifying violent felony. concerning his admission of the great bodily injury allegation under section 12022.7, subdivision (d), davis maintained the trial court result of [his] timely surrender, the enhancement was fully-stricken from the record, as evidenced administrative appeals. citing the sentencing hearing transcript and the te 5 plea agreement as reflected on his plea form, the department the department, the section 2933.1 limitation on worktime credit applied. c. superior court having exhausted his administrative remedies, davis challenged the recalculation of his worktime credit and resulting extension of his release date by filing a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the superior court. davis again argued there was no basis for limiting his worktime credit under section 2933.1 had imposed under section 12022.7, as reflected by its absence on the abstract of judgment. he also argued his admission to the allegation under section 12022.7, subdivision (d), could not serve as the basis for the worktime credit restriction because subdivision (g) of section 12022.7 provided that subdivision (d) does not apply where, as here, infliction of great bodily injury is an element of the underlying offense. the court determined the department properly relied on the sentencing hearing transcript, rather than the abstract of judgment, to court also ruled that, although the sentencing court erred in imposing the enhancement under section 12022.7, subdivision (d), because inflicting great bodily injury was an element of the underlying offense, davis could not challenge the error because 6 he admitted the section 12022.7 allegation as part of his plea agreement. discussion a. on september 13, 2017 the department filed a letter requesting we dismiss this petition as moot because september 7, 2017, due to a proposition 57 change in custody davis filed a letter opposing that request. at oral argument, counsel for the department conceded that, if we were to grant s petition, time [davis] was incarcerated beyond june 21st, 2016 could potentially be credited against [the] parole term he is currently serving. therefore, and the s request to dismiss is denied. (see people v. gregerson (2011) 202 cal.app.4th 306, 321 ] case becomes moot when a court ruling can have no practical effect or cannot provide thin re bush (2008) 161 cal.app.4th 133, 141 case law recognizes that time served in excess of the determinate term must be credited against the s parole period in re carter (1988) 199 cal.app.3d 271, 273 [release on parole did not render habeas petition moot becaany [worktime] credits to which [the prisoner] was entitled may reduce his parole period b. the worktime credit restriction did not apply section 2933.1 belongs to a group of statutes that authorize, limit, or prohibit the earning of presentence and postsentence credit for persons who are convicted of crimes and 7 sentenced to prison.in re pope, supra, 50 cal.4th at p. 781.) persons who have been convicted of certain qualifying violent felonies . . . are subject to a restriction upon the postsentence worktime credit they may earn against their sentence.

(in re mallard (2017) 7 cal.app.5th 1220, 1226.) section 2933.1, subdivision (a), which contains the 15 convicted of a felony offense listed in subdivision (c) of section (see in re mallard, supra, 7 cal.app.5th at p. 1225 under section 2933.1, if a person is convicted of a violent felony listed in section 667.5, subdivision (c) and is sentenced to state s presentence conduct credits and postsentence worktime credits are both limited to 15 percent, fn. omitted].) section 667.5, subdivision (c), lists a number of specific offenses, such as murder, mayhem, robbery, ny felony punishable by death or imprisonment in the state prison for life667.5, subdivision (c), - that, in relevant part, includes inflicts great bodily injury on any person other than an accomplice which has been charged and proved as provided for in ; see people v. hawkins (2003) 108 cal.app.4th 527, 530.) section 12022.7, subdivision (d), the allegation davis admitted here, who personally inflicts great bodily injury on a child under the age of five years in the commission of a felony or attempted felony shall be punished by an additional and consecutive term of 8 subdivision (g) of section 12022.7, however, provides that pursuant to his plea agreement, davis admitted inflicting great bodily injury within the meaning of section 12022.7, subdivision (d), in connection with the felony offense to which he pleaded no contest. we agree with the department that the sentencing hearing transcript, which controls, does not support s contention that the sentencing court struck that admission. (see people v. vega (2015) 236 cal.app.4th 484, 506 of judgment and the minute order or the abstract of judgment, t.) we also agree with the department that, even assuming section 12022.7, subdivision (g), deprived the sentencing court of authority to admission of the section 12022.7 allegation, davis cannot now challenge his sentence on that basis because he admitted the allegation pursuant to his plea agreement. (see people v. otterstein (1987) 189 cal.app.3d 1548, 1549-1551 [where, pursuant to a plea agreement, the defendant admits a section 12022.7 allegation and the trial court imposes a three-year enhancement, the defendant cannot argue on appeal the enhancement does not apply because great bodily injury is an element of his offense]; see also people v. buttram (2003) 30 in re stier (2007) 152 ; cf. people v. hester (2000) 22 cal.4th 290, 295 hile failure to 9 object is not an implicit waiver of section 654 rights, acceptance of the plea bargain here was.) s plea agreement, however, did not specify that his or that the 15 percent worktime credit restriction applied. thus, the credit restriction applies only if dfelony offense listed in subdivision (c) of section 66( 2933.1, subd. (a).) and he was not. attempting to elude an officer resulting in serious bodily injury is not one of the offenses listed in section 667.5, subdivision (c). the only other possibility for restricting davcredits under section 2933.1, subdivision (a), is conviction met the definition provided in the catch-all provision in section 667.5, subdivision (c)(8): a felony in which the defendant inflicts great bodily injury on any person other than an accomplice which has been charged and proved as provided for in but his conviction did not meet that definition: the great bodily injury allegation against davis because, according to subdivision (g) of that section, subdivision (d) does not apply where, as here, infliction of great bodily injury is an element of the offensepeople v. beltran (2000) 82 cal.app.4th 693, causing serious bodily injury under vehicle code section 2800.3]; see also people v. johnson (2016) 244 cal.app.4th 384, 391 [outside the context of jury instructions, as used in section 12022.7, are essentially equivalent; hawkins, supra, 108 cal.app.4th at p. odily injur 10 of section 243, subdivision (d)].) people v. hawkins, supra, 108 cal.app.4th 527 is on point. in that case, after a jury convicted the defendant of battery with serious bodily injury ( 243, subd. (d)) and the people struck a section 12022.7 great bodily injury allegation that was not submitted to the jury, the trial court concluded the defendant was convicted of a violent felony as defined by section 667.5, subdivision (c)(8), and applied the worktime credit restriction. (hawkins, at pp. 529-530.) the court of appeal, however, ruled the worktime credit restriction did not apply. (id. at pp. 531-532.) the court ion thatsection 12022.7 enhancement allegation was charged in the information[ section was proved when the jury found [the defendant] guilty of inflicting serious bodily injury under section s crime was a violent felony under section 667.5, subdivision (c)(8). (hawkins, at p. 530.) the court noted that section 12022.7 did not apply to the offense of battery with serious bodily injury because great bodily injury is an element of the offense2 (hawkins, at p. 531, quoting  12022.7, 2 the court in hawkins applied the version of section 12022.7 in effect at the time the defendant committed his crime, subdivision (a) of a person who personally inflicts great bodily injury on any person other than an accomplice in the commission or attempted commission of a felony shall, in addition and consecutive to the punishment prescribed for the felony or attempted felony of which he or she has been convicted, be punished by an additional term of three years, unless infliction of great bodily injury is an element of the offense of which he or she is convicted.hawkins, at pp. 530- 11 former subd. (a), now subds. (a), (g).) therefore, the court concluded charged and proved as provided for in section 12022.7, and section 667.5, subdivision (c)(8), did not apply. (hawkins, at pp. 530-531.) similarly, infliction of great bodily injury was an element of his underlying offense and therefore section 12022.7 did not apply. ( 667.5, subd. (c)(8).) for this reason, offense did not qualify as a violent felony under section 667.5, subdivision (c)(8), and the worktime credit restriction in section 2933.1 did not apply. disposition the petition for writ of habeas corpus is granted. we order that the date davis was entitled to be released from prison was june 21, 2016. segal, j. we concur: perluss, p. j. menetrez, j.* 531.) subdivision (e) of that version provided the enhancement applied regardless of whether infliction of great bodily injury was an element of the offense if the offense involved domestic violence. (hawkins, at p. 531.) the circumstances of the offense in hawkins did not involve domestic violence.
