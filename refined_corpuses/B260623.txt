(a)). as a result of this conviction, g.b. is required by section 290 to register as a sex offender throughout his lifetime. appellant contends that both the mandatory sex offender registration requirement and his statutory ineligibility for a certificate of rehabilitation deny him equal protection of the law. rehabilitation, we find no equal protection violation, and thus we affirm. factual and procedural background in 1991, a complaint was filed against appellant alleging three counts of lewd acts on a child under 14 years of age, a felony, in violation of section 288, subdivision (a). the infor appellant pled guilty to count 1 and was sentenced to one year in jail and five years probation. the jail sentence was suspended. the other counts were dismissed. in 2014, appellant filed a petition for a certificate of rehabilitation under section 4852.01, requesting relief from the obligation to register as a sex offender. the trial court denied the petition on the ground that [violation] is ineligible for the requested relief. appellant timely appealed. contentions appellant contends he has been denied equal protection of the law because his section 288 conviction subjects him to mandatory registration as a sex offender under section 290. appellant also argues that section 4852.01, subdivision (d), which bars 1 all further statutory references are to the penal code. 3 section 288 offenders from obtaining certificates of rehabilitation, violates his right to equal protection because similarly situated offenders are eligible for such relief.2 discussion 1. scope of issue cognizable before this court on appeal, appellant urges that he has been treated differently than persons convicted of engaging in unlawful sexual intercourse with a person under 18 in violation of section 261.5, because those offenders (1) are subject to discretionary, rather than mandatory, registration, and (2) may receive certificates of rehabilitation on an appropriate showing. for the reasons that follow, we reach only the second issue.3 final, claims for . . . relief from mandatory lifetime sex offender registration based on equal protection . . . must be brought by way of a petition for writ of mandate in the trial people v. picklesimer (2010) 48 cal.4th 330, 335 (picklesimer), italics added.) in the present case, appellant is no longer in custody, and any appeal from his 1991 conviction is final. therefore, in order to challenge the mandatory sex offender registration requirement, appellant was required to file a petition for writ of mandate. appellant did not file a petition for writ of mandate, and thus the constitutional validity of the mandatory sex offender registration requirement was not properly before the trial court a certificate of rehabilitation.4 2 . . . [his] we agree the trial court had jurisdiction to rule on the petition. 3 because we conclude that requirement is not properly before us, we do not reach his argument as to whether johnson v. department of justice people v. hofsheier (2006) 37 cal.4th 1185 should be given retroactive application here. 4 we note that the a certificate of rehabilitation as a petition for writ of mandate. (see picklesimer, supra, 48 cal.4th at p. 335, italics added in its discretion treat . . . a postjudgment counsel asserted that appellant did raise an equal protection challenge to the registration 4 departmen(picklesimer, supra, 48 cal.4th at p. 340.) even if we exercised our discretion to treat his [i]f the petition could have been filed first in a lower court, it must explain why the reviewing court should issue the writ as an original ; therefore, we do not reach his equal protection challenge to the sex offender registration requirement.5 2. standard of review in general, the denial of a petition for a certificate of rehabilitation is reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard. (see people v. lockwood (1998) 66 cal.app.4th 222, 226.) here, however, the trial court did not exercise its discretion in weighing the evidence before it because the court found that appellant was ineligible as a matter of law. on review of a constitutional claim on appeal involving purely questions of law, our review is de novo. (see people ex rel. lockyer v. sun pacific farming co. (2000) 77 cal.app.4th 619, 632.) 3. section 288, subdivision (a), offenders are not similarly situated to section 261.5 offenders; therefore, the certificate of rehabilitation law did not deny appellant equal protection of law under former who has been released from a state prison or other state penal institution or agency in requirement in his petition for a certificate of rehabilitation. although the petition briefly touched for a certificate of rehabilitation under section 4852.01, subdivision (d), and the trial petition as one for writ of mandate seeking relief from the sex offender registration requirement. 5 however, we note that our conclusion belowthat section 288, subdivision (a), offenders are not similarly situated to section 261.5 offenderswould also defeat this equal protection challenge. 5 california . . . who has not been incarcerated in a state prison or other state penal institution or agency since his or her release . . . may file the petition [for a certificate of 6 not apply to . . . persons convicted of a vi ( 4852.01, subd.

(a).) rcourse with a person under 18 years of age. ( 261.5.) 6 statute, which we quote herein. 6 to a meritorious claim under the equal protection clause is a showing that the state has adopted a classification that affects two or more similarly situated persons are similcooley v. superior court (2002) 29 cal.4th 228, 253.) ot similarly situated to a person who violates section 261.5. (people v. buffington (1999) 74 cal.app.4th 1149, 1155.) her statutes are similarly situated and whether there is a rational basis for statutory distinctions between people v. tuck (2012) 204 cal.app.4th 724, 734 (tuck).) here, the victims of a section 288, subdivision (a) crime are younger than 14. section 261.5, on the other hand, makes it a cit does not require the victim to be under the age of 14. 288(a) conviction involves preying on young, vulnerable children, these two categories of offenders are not similarly situated. (people v. alvarado (2010) 187 cal.app.4th 72, 77 & 79 (alvarado) [section 288, subdivision (a) offenders are not similarly situated to section 261.5 ]; tuck, supra, 204 cal.app.4th at p. 737 [persons convicted of violating section 288, subdivision[] (a) . . . are not similarly situated with persons convicted of sex people v. singh (2011) 198 cal.app.4th 364, 371 (singh) [a section 288, subdivision (a) tuated to offenders convicted under section 261.5 . . . because [that] provision[] [is] not limited to section 288 also contains a specific intent requirementit punishes acts done to, or gratifying the lust, passions, or sexual section 261.5, on the other hand, 7 concerns a general intent offense of committing unlawful sexual intercourse. mental state required for a conviction under section 288 is a distinction that is meaningful in deciding whether a person convicted under that statute is similarly situated with one people v. cavallaro (2009) 178 cal.app.4th 103, 114.) accordingly, appellant is not similarly situated to offenders convicted under section 261.5 on the additional ground that section 288 contains a specific intent requirement, while section 261.5 involves a general intent offense. (see singh, supra, 198 cal.app.4th at p. 371 situated to offenders convicted under section 261.5 . . . because [the latter] provision[] . . . ; alvarado, supra, 187 cal.app.4th at p. 79 [section 288, subdivision (a) offenders are not similarly situated to section 261.5 offenders because sexual intercourse.].) in sum, persons convicted of violating section 288, subdivision (a) are not similarly situated to those convicted of violating section 261.5. thus, section 288, tly similar to merit application of some level of scrutiny to determine whether distinctions between the two people v. nguyen (1997) 54 cal.app.4th 705, 715.) because appellant, as a section 288, subdivision (a) offender, is not similarly situated to a section 261.5 offender, his equal protection challenge fails at the threshold level. 8 disposition the order denying the petition for a certificate of rehabilitation is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports edmon, p. j. we concur: lavin, j. hogue, j.* * judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
