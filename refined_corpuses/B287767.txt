(see people v. panizzon (1996) 13 cal.4th 68, 7679 (panizzon).) instead, his appeal is limited s, including sentencing issues, that do not 5 people v. cuevas (2008) 44 cal.4th 374, 379.) a certificate of probable cause is also people v. enlow (1998) 64 cal.app.4th 850, 853854, citing panizzon, supra, at p. 78.) to amend the attempted murder charges to omit a premeditation clause and allege gun use without discharge. the assault with a deadly weapon charge was dismissed. the parties also agreed to a specified sentence and the underlying calculations that the sentence was based upon. thus, as in panizzon and enlow, the stipulated term was an integral part of the plea. partnrecent amendments to section 12022.53. a certificate of probable cause is therefore necessary to challenge the sentence on appeal. (panizzon, supra, 13 cal.4th at p. 78.) s supplemental brief, we conclude it raises no arguable issues on appeal. the abstract of judgment and minute order must be modified to correctly reflect the plea and oral pronouncement. where there is a discrepancy between the oral pronouncement of judgment and the minute order or the abstract of judgment, the oral pronouncement controls. (people v. mitchell (2001) 26 cal.4th 181, 185186.) we are otherwise fully complied with his responsibilities and that no other 6 arguable issues exist. (smith v. robbins (2000) 528 u.s. 259, 278284; people v. wende (1979) 25 cal.3d 436, 441.) disposition the judgment is modified to reflect that the 10-year firearm enhancement was imposed under section 12022.53, subdivision (b), rather than section 12022.53, subdivision (d). as so modified, the judgment is affirmed. the clerk of the superior court is directed to correct the may 25, 2005 minute order and abstract of judgment to reflect that the 10-year enhancement was imposed under section 12022.53, subdivision (b), prepare an amended abstract of judgment, and forward a certified copy to the department of corrections and rehabilitation. moor, j. we concur: baker, acting p.j. jaskol, j. judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
