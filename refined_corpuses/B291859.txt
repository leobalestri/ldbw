(a)). a jury convicted higa on both counts. the trial court imposed a prison term of four years on the burglary conviction and imposed but stayed under section 654 a sentence of one year four months on the grand theft conviction. the court ordered higa to pay restitution in the stipulated amounts of $4,000 to murakami and $243 to musoke. the court also ordered higa to pay an $80 court operations assessment, a $60 criminal conviction assessment, a $300 restitution fine, a $10 crime prevention fee, a $29 penalty assessment, and a $2 criminal surcharge. higa filed a timely notice of appeal. 4 discussion a. the trial court did not err in ordering higa to pay restitution to musoke 1. relevant proceedings during the trial, the court denied amend the information to add a petty theft count for the theft of locksmith services. at sentencing the prosecutor asked the court to order higa to pay $243 in restitution to musoke. the burglary, your honor. higa voiced his agreement to the proposed restitution order, and the court ordered him to pay musoke $243. higa argues the trial court imposed an unauthorized sentence and abused its discretion by ordering him to pay restitution to musoke. higa contends musoke was within the meaning of section 1202.4 because the information identified murakami as the only victim of the burglary and because services without payment. 2. higa did not forfeit his argument the trial court erred in ordering him to pay musoke restitution a defendant may forfeit an argument the trial court erred, including in calculating the amount of restitution, if the defendant fails to object in the trial court. (people v. anderson (2010) 50 cal.4th 19, 26 & fn. 6; people v. pinon (2016) 6 5 cal.app.5th 956, 968; people v. garcia (2010) 185 cal.app.4th 1203, 1218.) an order requiring the defendant to pay restitution to someone who is not entitled to it, however, is an unauthorized sentence (people v. slattery (2008) 167 cal.app.4th 1091, 1094-1096; people v. woods (2008) 161 cal.app.4th 1045, 1050), and an unauthorized sentence the general requirement that only those claims properly raised (anderson, at p. 26; see people v. rivera (2019) 7 cal.5th 306, 348-349 [an unauthorized sentence could not lawfully be imposed under any circumstance in the particular case is reviewable on appeal regardless of whether it was objected to at trial.) thus, if musoke was not entitled to order requiring higa to pay musoke $243 was unauthorized, and higa did not forfeit his argument by failing to object. (see people v. williams (2017) 7 cal.app.5th 644, 696 [stipulating to purely legal issue whether the court imposed the restitution order in excess of its statutory authoritypeople v. percelle (2005) 126 cal.app.4th 164, 179 [imposition of unauthorized restituf [the forfeit the issue by failing to object].) therefore, we will decide th the trial court erred in ordering restitution to musoke. 6 3. the trial court did not err in ordering higa to make restitution to musoke a. criminal restitution the california constitution, as amended in 1982 by proposition 8, provides all persons who suffer losses as a result of criminal activity shall have the right to seek and secure restitution from the persons convicted of the crimes causing the the convicted wrongdoer in every case, regardless of the sentence (cal. const., art. i,  28, subd. (b)(13)(a)-(b); see people v. martinez (2017) 2 cal.5th 1093, 1100 (martinez) california constitution . . . every crime victim has a right to be compensated by the defendant for losses incurred as a result of th people v. nichols (2017) 8 cal.app.5th (martinez, at p. 1100.) ibid.) section 1202.4, subdivision (a crime who incurs an economic loss as a result of the commission of a crime shall receive restitution directly from a defendant provides that, economic loss as a resshall require that the defendant make restitution to the victim or 7 (people v. nichols, supra, 8 cal.app.5th at p. 342), there are limits to the sentenced to a period of incarceration (in prison or jail), the court may order restitution only for this result is dictated by the language of section 1202.4, which conduct [citation] and by the unfairness that would result if a defendant were held responsible for losses caused by conduct underlying charges that were dismissed or of people v. walker (2014) 231 cal.app.4th 1270, 1274; see people v. williams, supra, 7 cal.app.5th at pp. 696-used in [section 1202.4,] subdivision (f) means the criminal (martinez, supra, 2 cal.5th at p. 1098.) -of-discretion standard to the trial restitution . . . . (people v. brunette (2011) 194 cal.app.4th 268, 277; see people v. williams (2010) 184 cal.app.4th 142, 146 order is legality of the restitution award in light of the applicable statutes and brunette, at p. 277; see people v. sy resting an abuse of the 8 ]; people v. williams, supra, 184 cal.app.4th interpretation of a statute, a question of law is raised, which is b. musoke is entitled to restitution the trial court did not err in ordering higa to make restitution to musoke. cthe information name musoke as a victim did not preclude the court from ordering higa to pay restitution to musoke. (see people v. walker, supra, 231 cal.app.4th at pp. 1273-1274 [trial court properly ordered the defendant to pay were not named in the charging document].) as the court in walker explained, restitution is appropriate for specifically named in the charging document is irrelevant. section 1202.4 imposes no such duty to name, and judicially restitution turn on the happenstance of whether the prosecutor located or named that victim before the defendant pled or was convicted. such abid. at pp. 1275-1276.) thus, did not depend on which victims the people named in the information or whether the people successfully sought to amend the information to bring additional charges or name additional victims. regarding hthe direct , we look to the criminal conduct of the burglary and grand theft offenses, not whether musoke was an 9 intended victim. (see walker, supra, 231 cal.app.4th at pp. 1274-arising out of the criminal conduct for which the defendant has martinez, supra, 2 cal.5th 1093 the california id. at p. 1105.) the supreme court explained, by way of example, that if a thief steals a car and a third party reckless driver damages it, the owner is entitled to restitution from the thief under section 1202.4, subdivision (f), criminal conduct (namely, the unlawful deprivation of his or her property) . . . martinez, at p. 1105; see people v. pierce (2015) 234 cal.app.4th 1334, 1336-1337 [owner of a stolen car, utility restitution for the economic loss they suffered as a result of de 1202.4, subd. (f), where the the stolen car into a telephone pole while attempting to evade the police, causing damage to the pole and a house]; see also people v. foalima (2015) 239 cal.app.4th 1376, 1396-the defendant set to destroy evidence of the murder because the bstantial factor .) like the owner of the in martinez, musoke suffered a in and stealing the jewelry box: musoke did not receive payment for his services because hill fled 10 the scene of the crime to complete the theft. committing the burglary and theft directly caused economic loss to several victims, including musoke. the supreme court also held in martinez that a court may means by martinez, supra, 2 cal.5th at pp. 1105-1106.) the supreme court explained, again by way of exampleif a burglar breaks a window to enter a home, he or she may be ordered to pay for the broken window in victim restitution, even though the burglary statute requires the prosecution to prove only that the defendant entered the house with the intent to commit a felony. [citation.] if the burglar happens to have committed the prohibited entry by some means that causes damage to the home, a trial court certainly canand must(ibid.) here, higa ulocksmith services as the means to enter the apartment, and the trial court properly ordered hill to pay for those services. b. remand is necessary to give higa the opportunity to request a hearing concerning his ability to pay the fines, fees, and assessments the court imposed in people v. dueas (2019) 30 cal.app.5th 1157 this court held that a trial court cannot impose a court operations assessment under section 1465.8 or a court facilities assessment under government code section 70373 without first determining s ability to pay and that the court must stay execution of a restitution fine until the court determines the defendant has the ability to pay. higa challenges the trial 11 imposition of the $300 restitution fine, the $80 court operations assessment, and the $60 criminal conviction assessment. the people argue higa forfeited his challenge to these fines, fees, and assessments because he did not object to them in the trial court. higa concedes he did not object in the trial court but argues that, because dueas was an unforeseen change in the law, his failure to object is excusable. higa did not forfeit his argument. as we explained in people v. castellano (2019) 33 cal.app.5th 485 (castellano), at the time the trial court sentenced the defendant, dueas had not yet been decided; and no california court prior to dueas had held it was unconstitutional to impose fines, fees or assessments without a determination of the defendants ability to pay. moreover, none of the statutes authorizing the imposition of the fines, fees or assessments at issue authorized the courts consideration of a defendants ability to pay. . . . when, as here, the defendants challenge on direct appeal is based on a newly announced constitutional principle that could not reasonably have been anticipated at the time of trial, reviewing courts have declined to find forfeiture. (castellano, at p. 489; see people v. jones (2019) 36 cal.app.5th 1028, 1031-1034; see people v. santos (aug. 15, 2019, h045518) ___ cal.app.5th ___, ___ [2019 wl 3821793, p. 5]; see generally people v. brooks (2017) 3 cal.5th 1, 92 [[r]eviewing courts have traditionally excused parties for failing to raise an issue at trial where an objection would have been futile or wholly unsupported by substantive law then in existence]; but see people v. bipialaka (2019) 34 cal.app.5th 455, 464; people v. frandsen (2019) 33 cal.app.5th 1126, 1154.) 12 the people also argue remand is not appropriate because the record does not establish higa lacks the financial ability or future earning capacity, including his ability to earn wages in prison, to pay the fines and assessments. the people are correct higa must request a hearing and present evidence on his ability to pay the fines and assessments. dueas, a defendant must in the first instance contest in the trial court his or her ability to pay the fines, fees and assessments to be imposed and at a hearing present evidence of his or her inability to pay the amouncastellano, at p. 490.) as discussed in the context of forfeiture, however, because higa was not aware of his right to challenge the fees, fines, and assessments based on his inability to pay, he should have the opportunity on remand to request a hearing and present evidence. s additional argument that remand is not appropriate because higa has not identified any adverse consequences resulting from imposition of the fines and assessments. a evidence of potential adverse consequences beyond the fee or assessment itself, as the imposition of a fine on a defendant unable to pay it is sufficient detriment to trigger due process (castellano, at p. 490.) because we remand the matter to the trial court so that higa may request a hearing and present evidence demonstrating his inability to pay the fines, fees, and assessments imposed by the trial court. if he demonstrates he does not have the ability to pay these amounts, the trial court must strike the assessments and fees and stay the execution of the restitution fine. if higa fails to 13 demonstrate his inability to pay these amounts, the fines, fees, and assessments imposed may be enforced. c. the trial court erred in failing to specify the statutory bases for the penalty assessment and enalty assessments must be (1) specified in the courts oral pronouncement of judgment, and (2) specifically listed in the abstract of judgment. (people v. hamed (2013) 221 cal.app.4th 928, 937.[a]lthough . . . a detailed recitation of all the fees, fines and penalties on the record may be tedious, california law does not authorize shortcuts . . . . moreover, [a] detailed description of the amount of and statutory basis for the fines and penalty assessments imposed would help the parties and the court avoid errors in this area. (people v. hartley (2016) 248 cal.app.4th 620, 636.) a trial court may satisfy these requirements in several ways: amount and statutory basis for any base fine and the amounts and statutory bases for any penalty assessments on the record, as [the court in people v. high (2004) 119 cal.app.4th 1192] suggests should be done. [citation.] or, in cases where the amounts and statutory bases for the penalty assessments have been set forth in a probation report, a sentencing memorandum, or some other writing, the court could state the amount and statutory basis for the base fine and make a shorthand reference um, or writing . . . . (hamed, at pp. 939-940.) ailure to specify the amount and statutory basis for each fine, fee, and penalty assessment is a legal error[ ] at 14 sentencing regardless of whether an objection or argument was raised . . . . [citation.] on remand for resentencing, the trial court shall specify the appropriate statutory bases for any fine, fee, and penalty assessments that it imposes.hartley, supra, 248 cal.app.4th at p. 637.) higa asserts the trial court failed to specify the statutory bases for the penalty assessment and criminal surcharge. higa argues the court erred because it only specified section 1202.5, which provides the basis for the crime prevention fine, but not the remaining two feesthe penalty assessment and criminal surcharge fees. higa is correct. the trial court did not orally pronounce the statutory basis for each of the three fines. in addition, the abstract of judgment does not specifically list the statutory basis for the criminal surcharge or the penalty assessment, and the court did not refer to the probation report or other document identifying the applicable statutory bases. therefore, we also remand for the trial court to separately list, with the statutory bases, any fines, fees, and penalties imposed and to prepare an amended abstract of judgment. 15 disposition the judgment is affirmed. the case is remanded with directions to give higa the opportunity to request a hearing and to present evidence demonstrating his inability to pay the applicable fines, fees, and assessments. the trial court is also directed to separately list, with the statutory bases, any fines, fees, and penalties imposed and to prepare and forward to the department of corrections and rehabilitation an amended abstract of judgment. segal, j. we concur: perluss, p. j. zelon, j.
