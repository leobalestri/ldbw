(a); count 1). de la cruz pleaded no contest to the charge and was sentenced to three years of formal probation with the condition that he serve 270 days in county jail.2 as part of the terms and conditions of his probation, the trial court ordered and informed de la cruz as follows: any time of the day or night by any probation officer or other peace officer with or without a warrant, probable cause or reasonable suspicion. this includes your person, your residence, any vehicles and electronic devices. [] with respect to your electronic devices you are waiving all rights under 1546 through 1546.4 of the penal code.[3] [] you are agreeing to provide any police officers with passwords to preliminary hearing transcript as well as the police reports as stipulated by defense counsel. 2 convictions for drug possession, driving on a suspended license, and petty theft. he had been sentenced to three years of probation in each of these cases. 3 according to penal code section 1546, subsection (f), means a device that stores, generates, or transmits information in electronic form. under section ny person in a trial, hearing, or proceeding may move to suppress any electronic information obtained or retained in violation of the fourth amendment to the united states 4 defense counsel objected to the electronic device search condition, arguing that it had no bearing on the case. the prosecutor responded that this particular search condition the court concurred, noting that [w]e have had to deal with this and everybody has reached a point where it has been part of the plea agreements. it makes a lot of sense because people do carry information on their cell phones court told defense counsel that if he objected to the search condition, it would be difficult to proceed with the plea. counsel respondedcase with the 10851. i could understand if it was a drug case or solicitation case, the court asked whether de la cruz wanted to withdraw his plea. after conferring with his client, defense counsel said de la cruz would agree to the condition in order to take advantage of the plea. on appeal, de la cruz challenges the electronic device search condition as unreasonable under lent, supra, 15 cal.3d 481. de la cruz also contends that the condition is unconstitutionally overbroad. discussion i. at the outset, the people claims are not cognizable on appeal because he did not first obtain a certificate of probable cause from the superior court. we disagree. 5 penal code4 section 1237.5 provides in relevant part: of conviction upon a plea of guilty or nolo contendere . . . except where both of the following are met: [] (a) the defendant has filed with the trial court a written statement, executed under oath or penalty of perjury showing reasonable constitutional, jurisdictional, or other grounds going to the legality of the proceedings. [] (b) the trial court has executed and filed a certificate of probable c notwithstanding the broad language of section 1237.5, it is well settled that a defendant may, without a certificate of probable cause, appeal issues regarding proceedings held subsequent to the plea for the purpose of determining the degree of the crime and the penalty to be imposed. (people v. jones (1995) 10 cal.4th 1102, 1106.) in determining whether section 1237.5 applies to a challenge of a sentence imposed after a guilty or no contest plea, courts must look to the substance of the appeal. he crucial issue is what the defendant is challenging, not the (people v. ribero (1971) 4 cal.3d 55, 63 (ribero).) therefore, the threshold question h challenge to the sentence imposed pursuant to a plea agreement is in substance a challenge to his guilty plea, and thus subject to 4 all further statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise indicated. 6 the requirements of section 1237.5. (people v. mcnight (1985) 171 cal.app.3d 620, 624.) -of-the- test requires us to determine if the facts support a challenge to the sentence imposed rather than to validity of the guilty plea, without determining the merits of the appeal itself. (ibid.) as the california supreme court has noted, when a defendant has agreed to a particular sentence as part of a plea bathe rationale for circumscribing the right to appeal pursuant to section 1237.5 applies with equal forc(people v. panizzon (1996) 13 cal.4th 68, 79 (panizzon).) in challenge to a negotiated sentence imposed as part of a plea bargain is properly viewed as a challenge to t5 (ibid.) therefore, it [is] incumbent upon [such a] defendant to seek and obtain a probable cause certificate in order to attack the sentence on (ibid.) however, the plea agreement in this case did not include the electronic device search condition. rather, the agreement simply stated that de la cruz would receive obation. no terms or conditions were specified within the agreement. nor did the court state that it would impose an electronic device search condition before de la cruz entered his no contest plea. thus, unlike the 5 see people v. buttram (2003) 30 cal.4th 773, 789 (buttram) parties agree to a specified sentence, any challenge to that sentence attacks a term, and thus the ). 7 defendant in panizzon, supra, 13 cal.4th 68, de la cruz is not (id. at p. 89.) claim is not, in substance, an attack on the validity of the plea. (see ibid.) the parties left to judicial discretion the proper conditions to impose within the agreed-upon three-year probationary term. unless the agreement itself specifies otherwise, appellate issues relating to this reserved discretion are therefore outside the plea bargain and cannot constitute an attack upon its validity (buttram, supra, 30 cal.4th at p. 789.) simply put, conditions of probation which were not part of the plea bargain and were imposed after entry of the plea are appealable without a certificate of probable case. (people v. narron (1987) 192 cal.app.3d 724, 730.) he acceptance of probation does not preclude a challenge on appeal to the validity of a probation condition.ibid.) therefore, the claim is reviewable on e to seek and obtain a certificate of probable cause. (see buttram, supra, 30 cal.4th at p. 790.) ii. the search condition and the lent, supra, 15 cal.3d 481 test the legislature has placed in trial judges a broad discretion in the sentencing process, including the determination as to whether probation is appropriate and, if so, the conditions ther (lent, supra, 15 cal.3d at p. 486.) consequently, we review conditions of probation only for 8 abuse of discretion. (people v. olguin (2008) 45 cal.4th 375, 379 (olguin).) a condition of probation will not be held the offender was convicted, (2) relates to conduct which is not in itself criminal, and (3) requires or forbids conduct which is not reasonably related to future criminality. (lent, at p. 486.) conversely, a condition of probation which requires or forbids conduct which is not itself criminal is valid if that conduct is reasonably related to the crime of which the defendant was convicted or to future criminality. (ibid.) de la cruz contends the electronic device search condition was unreasonable under the three-prong test set forth in lent, supra, 15 cal.3d 481.6 the lent test is conjunctiveall three prongs must be satisfied before a reviewing court will invalidate a probation term. as such, even if a condition of probation has no relationship to the crime of which a defendant was convicted and involves conduct that is not itself criminal, the condition is valid as long as the condition is reasonably related to preventing 6 the california supreme court is currently reviewing whether a trial court may impose an electronic device search (see in re ricardo p.

(olguin, supra, 45 cal.4th at pp. 379380.)7 whether an electronic device search condition is reasonably related to preventing future criminality depends upon the facts and circumstances in each case. (in re j.e., supra, 1 cal.app.5th at p. 802, rev. granted; people v. burton (1981) 117 cal.app.3d 382, 391; in re martinez (1978) 86 cal.app.3d 577, 584.) the people concede the electronic device search condition has no s specific offense and that using a cell phone or other electronic device does not itself constitute unlawful conduct. thus, the question here is whether the search condition is reasonably related to 7 olguin, supra, 45 cal.4th 375 upheld a probation condition requiring the defendant to inform his probation officer of any pets in his residence. the defendant challenged the condition as invalid under lent, supra, 15 cal.3d 481, arguing that pet ownership was not reasonably related to his crime or his future criminality. (olguin, at p. 380.) the california supreme court disagreed, explaining distract, impede, and endanger probation officers in the exercise of their supervisory duties. by mandating that probation officers be kept informed of the presence of . . . pets, this notification condition facilitates the effective supervision of probationers and, as such, is reasonably (id. at p. 378.) in short, a probation condition is reasonably related to future (id. at pp. 380381; see people v. balestra (1999) 76 cal.app.4th 57, 69.) 10 preventing future criminality by de la cruz. as de la cruz notes, however, when before the trial court, [t]here was no explanation of how the search condition would reasonably prevent future criminal activity: indeed, the condition was a blanket condition the court imposed on all probationers. we recently addressed this very issue in people v. bryant (2017) 10 cal.app.5th 396, review granted june 28, 2017, s241937 (bryant), wherein we struck an electronic device search condition.8 in bryant, the defendant was convicted of possessing a concealed and loaded firearm in a vehicle. (id. at p. 398.) the trial court imposed a two-year sentence, part of which was to be served by the defendant under mandatory supervision. (ibid.) as part of his supervision, the trial court required the defendant to submit -mails, and photographs on any cellular phone or other electronic device in his (ibid.) on appeal, we struck the electronic search condition 8 pending review and filing of the california supreme s opinion, unless otherwise ordered by the supreme court, a published opinion of a court of appeal may be cited for potentially persuasive value only. (see cal. rules of court, rule 8.1115.) we also note that although the supreme court has granted review in bryant, supra, 10 cal.app.5th 396, review granted, the supreme court has deferred briefing in the case pending its decision in in re ricardo p., supra, 241 cal.app.4th 676, review granted. 11 past or future. [the defendant] was convicted of possessing a concealed weapon in a vehicle. no cellular phone or electronic device was involved in the crime and there is no evidence that [the defendant] would use such devices to engage in future criminal activity.

(see, e.g., in re j.e., supra, 1 cal.app.5th 795, rev. granted; in re p.o. (2016) 246 cal.app.4th 288.) although these cases were instructive, our consideration of them had to take into account the fact the power of the state to control the conduct of children reaches beyond the scope of its authority over adults. (ginsberg v. new york (1968) 390 u.s. 629, 638.) this is because juvguidance and supervision ts constitutional rights are more circumscribed 11 (in re victor l. (2010) 182 cal.app.4th 902, 910.) thus, a probation condition that would be reasonable and permissible for a minor under juvenile court supervision may id. at p. 381.) however, imposing such a requirement does not resolve the underlying issuewhether the officer could search the device in the first place. 11 to that end, juvenile offenders must accept a probationary sentence and its accompanying terms while an adult offender can refuse probation if he or she believes its terms are more onerous than the sentence which might be imposed in its place. (in re sheena k. (2007) 40 cal.4th 875, 889.) in bryant, supra, 10 cal.app.5th, review granted, the defendant had been sentenced to mandatory supervision, thus mirroring a juvenile case in that respect. (see id. at p. 400.) while we noted this fact in bryant, our decision in that case did not rest upon it. 14 be unconstitutional or otherwise improper for an adult probationer. (in re sheena k., supra, 40 cal.4th at p. 889.) despite these caveats, several juvenile cases have concluded that electronic device search conditions do not pass muster under lent, supra, 15 cal.3d 481. in in re erica r. (2015) 240 cal.app.4th 907 (erica r.), such a condition was imposed on a juvenile who had been placed on probation after admitting to misdemeanor drug possession. (id. at p. 910.) the erica r. court invalidated the search condition under the third prong of lent, noting, nothing in this record regarding either the current offense or s social history that connects her use of electronic devices or social media to illegal drugs. in fact, the record is s usage of electronic devices or social (erica r., at p. 913.) the court concluded current offenses or [her] personal history that demonstrates believe the current restriction will serve the rehabilitative function of precluding [the minor] from any future criminal (ibid.) can be cas history and circumstances, an electronic search condition bears a reasonable connection to the risk of future (id. at p. 914.) in in re j.b. (2015) 242 cal.app.4th 749 (j.b.), a juvenile who committed petty theft was placed on probation 15 with a search condition that required him to allow searches of and disclose the passwords to his electronic devices and social media sites. (id. at p. 752.) the trial court found that the search condition would deter the minor from committing new crimes and allow probation officers to monitor the s compliance with the terms and conditions of probation. (id. at p. 753.) on appeal, the people argued the condition was reasonably related to future criminality because it served to facilitate monitoring by probation officers of the conditions prohibiting the use of alcohol and drugs, requiring the minor to stay away from the coparticipant with whom he committed the theft, requiring the minor to attend school, and requiring him to obey his parents. (id. at p. 755.) following the reasoning in erica r., supra, 240 cal.app.4th 907, the j.b. court held that the search condition was invalid under lent, supra, 15 cal.3d 481 ny connection s use of electronic devices and his past or potential future criminal 12 (j.b., at p. 756.) 12 the j.b., supra, 242 cal.app.4th 749 court also questioned whether olguin, supra, 45 cal.4th 375 justifies a probation condition that facilitates general supervision of a s activities if the condition requires or forbids noncriminal conduct bearing no relation ts offense that is not reasonably related to potential future criminali(j.b., in our view, such a broad condition cannot be squared with the limitations imposed by lent[, supra, 15 cal.3d 481] . . . and in some cases may 16 like the minors in erica r., supra, 240 cal.app.4th 907 and j.b., supra, 242 cal.app.4th 749and the adult in bryant, supra, 10 cal.app.5th 396, review grantedthere is no showing of electronic device and criminality, past or future. de la cruz was convicted of the unlawful driving or taking of a vehicle. no cell phone or electronic device was involved in the crime and there is no evidence that de la cruz would use such devices to engage in future criminal activity. (see erica r., at p. 913.) nor was there any showing as to how the search condition would reasonably prevent any future crime or aid rehabilitation. although it is conceivable that future sephone might yield probation condition bearing a remote, attenuated, tangential, or diaphanous connection to future criminal (people v. brando (2012) 210 cal.app.4th 568, 574.) as in erica r. and j.b., without facts demonstrating a predisposition to use electronic devices (j.b., at p. 757.) the j.b. court ultimately rejected the application of olguin in the context of an electrthat [the] search condition would facilitate general oversight s activities is insufficient to justify an open-ended search condition permitting review of all information contained or as smart phone or other electronic devicej.b., at p. 758.) 17 there is no reason to believe the current restriction will serve the rehabilitative function of precluding [de la cruz] from any future criminal acts.erica r., at p. 913.) the people maintain that erica r., supra, 240 cal.app.4th 907 and j.b., supra, 242 cal.app.4th 749 are distinguishable. as the people correctly note, erica r. and j.b. both involved minors with apparently limited records, not an adult repeat offender with a history of being placed on probation like [de la cruz]. however, this particular circumstance only bolsters our holding. the juvenile offenders in erica r. and j.b. arguably received the stricter supervision condition by virtue of their youth (see in re victor l., supra, 182 cal.app.4th at p. 910), while de la cruz ostensibly received this supervision by virtue of his criminal record. impose more onerous probation terms in a juvenile case, the appellate courts still struck down the electronic device search condition at issue in both erica r. and j.b. if an electronic device search condition cannot pass muster under lent, supra, 15 cal.3d 481 when imposed in a juvenile case, it certainly should not when imposed on an adult probationer, where the justification for state supervision . . . is weaker than in the case of minors, and his constitutionally protected interest in his privacy is greater. (bryant, supra, 10 cal.app.5th at p. 406, rev. granted; see in re antonio r. (2000) 78 cal.app.4th 937, 941.) according to the people, erica r., supra, 240 cal.app.4th 907 and j.b., supra, 242 cal.app.4th 749 also 18 gave short shrift to olguin, supra, 45 cal.4th 375. although erica r. only cited olguin when noting the lent, supra, 15 cal.3d 481 test is conjunctive, (see erica r., at p. 912), the court also noted that its holding was narrow and there can be cas history and circumstances, an electronic search condition bears a reasonable connection to the risk of future criminality.13 (erica r., at p. 914.) thus, while acknowledging the underlying tenet of olguina probation condition is reasonably related to future criminality if it enables a 13 as an example, the erica r., supra, 240 cal.app.4th 907 court cited people v. ebertowski (2014) 228 cal.app.4th 1170, where a defendant was convicted of making criminal threats to a police officer. the threats included references to his status as a gang member, and at sentencing the prosecution introduced copies of social media posts made by the defendant which promoted his gang. as a condition of his probation, the trial court required the defendant to submit his electronic devices, along with electronic and social media passwords, to his probation officer for search at any time. (ebertowski, at pp. 11721173.) the court of appeal, sixth district, upheld this condition. after noting that the underlying offense was gang related, the court stated that the def also necessarily related to his future criminality. his association with his gang gave him the bravado to threaten (id. at pp. 11761177.) thus, in ebertowski, the record tied the use of social media to the facts of the underlying offense, making the connection between social media and future criminality reasonable. 19 probation officer supervise his or her charges effectivelythe erica r. court simply refused to treat it like a bright line rule. the erica r. court was correct in doing so given that lents third-prong jurisprudence has been on the particular facts and circumstances of the case before the court, rather than on establishing bright-line rules. (people v. trujillo (2017) 15 cal.app.5th 574, 584 (trujillo).) this makes sense given that the appropriateness of a particular probation condition necessarily depends on a myriad of tangible and intangible factors before the trial s particular crime, criminal background, and future prospects. (ibid.) olguin, supra, 45 cal.4th 375 finding of reasonableness for every probation condition that may potentially assist a probation officer in supervising a (people v. soto (2016) 245 cal.app.4th 1219, 1227 [striking probation condition requiring defendant get hanging county of residence].) rather, under olguin, our role in evaluating the third lent, supra, 15 cal.3d 481 factor is to determine whether there is a reasonable factual basis for the trial court to decide that the probation condition will assist the probation department to supervise the defendant. (olguin, at pp. 380381; accord, in re p.o., supra, 246 cal.app.4th at pp. 293296.) the facts do not support this conclusion in this case. although de la cruz has a criminal background, nothing in 20 the record demonstrates that cell phones or other electronic devices were involved in his past crimes. nor is there any evidence that de la cruz used electronic devices when committing his current offense or that he would use such devices to engage in future criminal activity. it may be that lent, supra, 15 cal.3d 481 and olguin, supra, 45 cal.4th 375 are satisfied if the facts show the electronics-search condition will allow the probation department to effectively supervise the defendant to further the dual goals of rehabilitating the defendant and protecting the public14 14 the facts in trujillo, supra, 15 cal.app.5th 574 demonstrate the quantum and nature of evidence needed to show an electronic device search condition is reasonably related to preventing future criminality. in trujillo, the 19-year-old defendant pleaded guilty to committing violent offenses against innocent bystanders in two separate incidents, and claimed to have done so because of alcohol intoxication. (id. trujillo ha[d] substantial risk factors relevant to reoffending, including significant untreated alcohol abuse, social isolation, family history of suicide (one of which he witnessed), family members who had been gang members, and economic stress. (ibid.) the trial court imposed the search condition aware of these facts s conclusion that trujillo would require close supervision of his daily activities to support a successful probation. show[ed] the trial court did not impose this condition as a matter of routine, but considered the specific facts relevant s case.ibid.) here, of course, we are presented with the precisely opposite scenariothe trial court expressly admitted it imposed the condition as a matter of 21 (trujillo, supra, 15 cal.app.5th at p. 585.) however, we have been presented with no facts here, other than the unelaborated observation that de la cruz has a rap sheet, accompanied by absolutely no details regarding those prior offenses. this cannot be deemed sufficient. probation search conditions may promote rehabilitation and reduce recidivism while helping to protect the community from potential harm by probationers. (olguin, at p. 380.) but the might aid a probation officer in ascertaining [his] compliance with other conditions of supervision is, without more, an insufficient rationale to justify the impairment of [his] constitutionally protected interest in privacy. (bryant, supra, 10 cal.app.5th at p. 404, rev. granted.) consequently, we hold that the search condition is invalid under lent and strike the condition. because we hold that the condition is invalid under lent, we need not address whether it is also constitutionally overbroad.15 routine and did not consider the facts relevant to de la 15 we do note that cases upholding an electronic device search condition against a lent, supra, 15 cal.3d 481 challenge have gone on to strike the condition as unconstitutionally overbroad.
