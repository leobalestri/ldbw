(a)). she was sentenced to six years in state prison. defendant contends the trial court failed to adequately advise her of her constitutional rights before accepting her admission of a prior conviction. we find that under the totality of the circumstances on of her prior conviction was knowing and intelligent. we modify the oral pronouncement of judgment as to assessments. we affirm the judgment in all other respects. ii. procedural facts the information alleged defendant had a prior serious or violent felony conviction within the meaning of penal code sections 667, subdivisions (b) through (i) and 1170.12. trial on the prior conviction allegation was bifurcated. after the jurors commenced deliberation, defendant waived her right to a jury trial on the prior conviction allegation. prior to the waiver, the trial court advised defendant of her right to a jury trial, but not her sims want to waive a jury on the priors defendant]: yes. [] the court: ms. sims, if the jury convicts you, you have a right to have this same jury determine if you suffered any prior convictions in which you went to state prison. mr. salas has indicated to the court that you are willing to waive jury, only if they find you guilty, and have the court determine if you suffered any priors. [] is that correct? [] the defendant: yeah. [] the court: do you understand that you have the right to a jury trial? [] the defendant: (nods head.) [] the court: understanding that right, do you now waive and give up your right to a jury trial on the priors only? [] the defendant: yes. [] the court: counsel join? [] mr. salas: yes. [] the court: people join? [] mr. holcomb: counsel joins. that also includes the strike prior allegation. [] the court: all priors.

[] . . . [] the court: mr. holcomb, do you have anything you want to offer this morning? [] mr. holcomb: i do. i was wondering if defense was going to stipulate or just admit the prior? [] mr. salas: just admit it and have the judgsalas: the strike prior. [] the court: okay. [] the court: ms. sims, your counsel has indicated that you are willing to admit that on february 13, 1985, in this county you were convicted of the crime of first degree burglary and that is a strike. [] do you understand that? [] the defendant: yeah. [] the court: you have a right to have me, sitting as the judge alone, look at all the evidence and make a determination whether that charge is true or not. mr. salas also has indicated that you are willing to admit it.

[] the court: iii. discussion the question before us is whether, under the totality of the circumstances, people v. hinton (2006) 37 cal.4th 839, 875, fn. 12; people v. mosby (2004) 33 cal.4th 353, 360.) we must examine the entire record to assess whether dewith an understanding of her rights. (id. at p. 361; accord, people v. hinton, supra, 37 cal.4th at p. 875, fn. 12.) we find that it was. defendant was represented at trial by counsel. when the trial court inquired whether defendant was willing to admit her prior conviction, she conferred with her attorney, lizandro salas, before doing so. when defendant admitted the prior conviction allegation was true, she had just undergone a jury trial. she did not testify at that trial. hence she had just exercised her right to remain silent. the prosecution was forced to prove the charges against her. defendant, through counsel, had confronted the adverse witnesses at trial. therefore, she would have understood her confrontation right. moreover, defendant had extensive experience with the criminal justice system. she had 14 prior convictions as an adult. under the totality of the circumstances, defendant voluntarily and intelligently admitted the prior conviction allegation was true. (people v. hinton, supra, 37 cal.4th at p. 875, fn. 12; people v. mosby, supra, 33 cal.4th at pp. 364-365.) 5 b. assessments the trial court imposed a $30 court facilities assessment (gov. code,  70373, subd. (a)(1)) and a $40 court operations assessment (pen. code,  1465.8, subd. (a)(1)). the assessments should have been imposed as to each of the two counts of which defendant was convicted. (people v. sencion (2012) 211 cal.app.4th 480, 483-484; see people v. alford (2007) 42 cal.4th 749, 758, fn. 6.) the oral pronouncement of judgment must be modified to so provide. the abstract of judgment is correct in this regard and need not be amended. iv. disposition the oral pronouncement of judgment is modified to impose $80 in court operations assessments (pen. code,  1465.8, subd. (a)(1)) and $60 in court facilities assessments (gov. code,  70373, subd. (a)(1)). the judgment is affirmed in all other respects. not to be published in the official reports turner, p.j. we concur: kriegler, j. judge of the ventura superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
