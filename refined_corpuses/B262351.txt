(a)),1 and alleged that he personally used a deadly weapon ( 12022, subd. (b)(1)). the trial court instructed the jury on the crimes of first degree murder, second degree murder, and voluntary manslaughter based on provocation. the jury found defendant guilty of second degree murder and found the deadly weapon allegation true. the court 1 all further statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise indicated. 3 sentenced defendant to prison for 16 years to life15 years to life on the murder count, plus an additional year for the deadly weapon finding. defendant timely appeals. discussion i. instructional errors defendant argues that the trial court committed two errors when instructing the jury: (1) twhen explaining the provocation required for voluntary manslaughter; and (2) the court did not on its own give an instruction for the lesser-included offense of involuntary manslaughter. we independently assess whether the trial court committed these instructional errors.

(accord, canizalez, supra 6 ]; people v. gurule (2002) 28 cal.4th 557, 660 [same].) citing people v. russell (2006) 144 cal.app.4th 1415, defendant argues that the instructions, but instead part of the has a sua sponte duty to instruct. to be sure, russell sponte duty to instruct on mistake of fact if the defendant relies on the defense or if there is substantial evidence that supports the defense and the defense is not inconsistent with id. at p. 1427.) but russell is inapt for two reasons. by its own terms, russell imposes a sua sponte duty to instruct on mistake of fact when mistake of fact is a defense to a crime. here, defendant is not asserting mistake of fact as a defenseas to preserve his ability to seek a voluntary manslaughter verdict when the victim was not the provoker. even if russell were somehow applicable, our supreme court overruled russell a few years later in people v. anderson (2011) 51 cal.4th 989, 996-997, when it held that a trial court had no sua sponte duty to instruct on the defense of accident. (see also people v. lawson (2013) 215 cal.app.4th 108, 117-1wake of anderson,. . . russell is apparently no longer good law to the extent it held that b. lesser-included crime of involuntary manslaughter as part of its duty to instruct the jury on generally applicable principles of law, a trial court may be required on its own to instruct the jury not only on the charged offenses, but also any lesser offenses that are necessarily included in each charged offense.

(people v. bobo (1990) 229 cal.app.3d 1417, 1440.) by contrast, involuntary manslaughter is a killing without legal or factual malice. it is defined as an and commission of an unlawful act ( 192, subd. (b)), a misdemeanor (ibid.), a noninherently dangerous felony (people v. burroughs (1984) 35 cal.3d 824, 835), or an inherently dangerous assaultive felony (people v. brothers (2015) 236 cal.app.4th 24, 33-34 (brothers).2 without refer to criminal negligenceunintentional conduct which is gross or reckless, amounting to a disregard of human life or an indifference to the consequences.people v. guillen (2014) 227 cal.app.4th 934, 1027 (guillen), citing people v. penny (1955) 44 cal.2d 861, 879.) 2 killings in the course of inherently dangerous felonies that are not assaultive in nature are murder under the felony-murder doctrine.

(people v. rangel (2016) 62 cal.4th 1192, 1220.) this circumstances of the people v. smith (2005) 37 cal.4th 733, 741.) thus, . . . [a] defendant indisputably has deliberately engaged in a type of aggravated assault the natural consequences of which are dangerous to human life, thus satisfying the objective component of implied malice as a matter of law, and no material issue is presented as to whether the defendant subjectively appreciated the danger to human life his or her conduct posed, there is no sua sponte duty to instruct on involuntary brothers, supra, 236 cal.app.4th at p. 35.) here, there is no question that to he stabbed his victim three times with a screwdriver and with such ne of the blows cracked a rib. there is also no material issue as to whether defendant subjectively appreciated the danger his conduct posed. defendant points to his trial testimony, in which he states that he did n however, this testimony establishes at most the 9 (gonzalez, supra, 54 cal.4th at p. 653), this testimony is unhelpful in assessing whether defendant acted without implied malice. defendant also proffers his additional trial testimony that he did not [he] in brothers, supra, 236 cal.app.4th at pp. 34-going to happestate warranting an involuntary manslaughter instruction. here, the evidence of and, more critically, the absence of any criminal negligenceis overwhelming. in his pretrial statement to police and elsewhere in his testimony, defendant admitted to knowing what he was doing and intending it: he stated [the insult hurler],fie caught up with the victim, that and that the screwdriver he told his girlfriend on these facts, there is no material issue that defendant acted with implied malice, not due to negligence; substantial evidence did not support an involuntary manslaughter instruction. (accord, cook, supra, 39 cal.4th at pp. 596-597 [defendant not entitled to involuntary brothers, at pp. 27-28, 34-35 [defendant not entitled to involuntary manslaughter instruction after she repeatedly beat her victim with a broomstick, burned him with cigarettes, and shoved a cloth gag down his throat]; guillen, supra, 227 cal.app.4th at pp. 1027-1028 [defendant not entitled to involuntary manslaughter instruction after he violently attacked victim].) in the torso with a screwdriver is not unequivocally a manifestation of . . . a conscious to the extent he is urging this proposition we must follow as a matter of law, we disagree: stabbing a person not once, not twice, but three times with a five- or six-inch bladed screwdriver can indeed manifest a conscious disregard for life. on the facts of this case, it most certainly did. 10 even if we were to ignore the weight of this precedent and conclude that the trial court erred in not instructing the jury on the crime of involuntary manslaughter, that error was both harmless beyond a reasonable doubt (chapman v. california (1967) 386 u.s. 18, 24), and not reasonably probable to have caused a more favorable result (people v. watson (1956) 46 cal.2d 818, 836) for the same reasons outlined abovenamely, the ii. prosecutorial misconduct federal constitution if it so egregious that it infects the trial with such unfairness as to make the conviction a dinvolves the use of deceptive or reprehensible methods to attempt to persuade either the court or the (people v. peoples ruling on prosecutorial misconduct for an abuse of discretion. (id. at pp. 792-793.) defendant argues that the prosecutor in this case committed misconduct by misstating the law during her closing argument. in her statement, the prosecutor accurately read the portion of calcrim no. the provocation was sufficient, consider whether a person of average disposition in the same situation and knowing the same facts would have reacted from passion rather than reasonable person have killed the individual the prosecutor later repeated this formulation of the issue. sstated the proper inquiry under the law. in people v. beltran (2013) 56 cal.4th 935, 949 (beltran), our supreme court rejected the argument that voluntary manslaughter turns on whether the an ordinary person of average disposition [to] killinstead, the court held that provocation turns on whether the provocation would prompt a person act rashly and under the influence of such intense emotion that his judgment or reasoning process [would be] obscured.id. at p. 956.) in other words, the surrounding circumstancesand 11 whether it was sufficient to cause a reasonable person to act rashly. how the killer responded to the provocation and the reasonableness of the response is not relevant to people v. najera (2006) 138 cal.app.4th 212, 223 (najera).) because the prosecutor argued that the jury should ask whether an average instead of whether they would be moved to act rashlythe prosecutor misstated the law and thereby committed prosecutorial misconduct. (people v. cortez it is improper for the prosecutor to we nevertheless conclude that this misconduct does not warrant a new trial for admonition to the jury, and this failure to object precludes us from granting him relief on appeal. (najera, supra, 138 cal.app.4th o preserve for appeal a claim of prosecutorial misconduct, the defendant must make a timely objection at trial and request an admonition to the juryalthough a defendant is excused from this requirement where an objection would be futile (ibid.), there is no reason to believe it would have been futile here. constitutionally ineffective for not objecting is without merit because defendant cannot establish either (1) deficient performance, or (2) prejudice. (strickland, supra, 466 u.s. at pp. 687, 694.) nt, we are required to strickland, supra, 466 u.s. on a claim of ineffective assistance on appeal, the record must affirmatively disclose the lack of a rational tactical purpose for the (people v. cash (2002) 28 cal.4th 703, 734; accord, strickland, at p. 689; cf. people v. pope (1979) 23 cal.3d 412, 426 [where a court cannot ascertain whether a decision was tactical, the issue should be left for review on habeas].) in this case, defense counsel that she got the law wrong and repeatedly advising the jury that it must focus on whether 12 the reasonable person in this scenario, whether that person would have reacted from passion rather than judgment than object to it, is a tactical one. (see, e.g., people v. slaughter (2002) 27 cal.4th 1187, 1209-1210.) because the jury was instructedmultiple timesthat recitation of the law trumped the attorn we presume the jury followed this instruction in the absence of evidence to the contrary (people v. homick (2012) 55 cal.4th 816, 866-867), and here there was none. courinstruction that the lawyers opening and closing statements were not to be considered (people v. sanchez (1995) 12 cal.4th 1, 70, overruled on other grounds as stated in people v. doolin (2009) 45 cal.4th 390.) in beltran, our supreme court held that a trial court focusing on whether the provocation would prompt a reasonable person to kill. (beltran, supra, 56 cal.4th at pp. 955-956.) hjury instruction on voluntary manslaughter set forth the proper standard all along. in sum, no prejudice flowed from any deficiency disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. _______________________, j. hoffstadt we concur: ________________________, acting p.j. ashmann-gerst ________________________, j. chavez
