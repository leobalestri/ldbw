(sb 620). the trial court denied the request, concluding that the counsel filed a brief under people v. wende (1979) 25 cal.3d 436 (wende), requesting that this court conduct an independent review of the record. having done so, we affirm s request. background in april 2011, appellant shot and killed an unarmed rival gang member inside a los angeles nightclub following a brief exchange between the two. one of the bullets appellant fired struck an unintended victim, seriously injuring him. following trial, a jury convicted appellant of first degree murder ( 187, subd.
