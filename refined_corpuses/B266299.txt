(b)(1)); and (2) attempted willful, deliberate, and premeditated murder ( 187, subd. (a), 664). the people alleged with respect to count 1 that the following circumstances in section 667.61 applied: the victim was a child under 14 years of age and the defendant inflicted great bodily injury ( 667.61 subds. (d)(6), (j)(1)); the victim was a child under 14 years of age and the defendant committed the substantive offense during a burglary ( 667.61 subds. (e)(2), (j)(2)); and the victim was a child under 14 years of age and the defendant used a deadly weapon ( 667.61 subds. (e)(3), (j)(2)). the people alleged with respect to count 2 that valcillo personally inflicted great bodily injury within the meaning of section 12022.7, subdivision (a), and personally used a deadly and dangerous weapon within the meaning of section 1192.7, subdivision (c)(23). at trial, the court instructed the jury with calcrim no. 301, which provides that the testimony of only one witness can prove any fact. the trial court did not give the bracketed portion of the instruction, which says, [except for the testimony of _______ e>, which requires supporting evidence [if you decide (he/she) is an accomplice],] . . . .2 (calcrim no. 301.) valcillo did not object to the omission or ask the court to read the bracketed portion of the instruction. the guilty verdict form for count 1 crime of forcible lewd act upon a child, to wit, alondra, a child under the age of 14 years . . . (emphasis omitted.) the guilty verdict form also asked the jury to find true or not true the allegations 3) committed the the verdict form did not ask the jury to find true or not true a separate allegation that alondra was under the age of 14. 2 the 5 this omission was not the result of inadvertence or oversight. counsel for valcillo stipulated that the guilty verdict form for count 1, which already required the jury to find alondra was under the age of 14 in order to convict him of forcibly committing a lewd act upon a child, did not need to ask the jury a separate question whether the allegation alonda was under the age of 14 was true. counsel, do you stipulate that the verdict forms do not need to contain a separate finding beyond a guilty verdict in count 1? they do not need to contain a separate finding specifically as to the enhancements that the victim, alondra, was under the age of 14? presented at trial, at least a couple of times, [was], especially from alondra, what her birth date was and how old she was; so the age is not an issue. right. . . . since the conviction in count 1 would necessarily be that the victim is under . . . 14, counsel both agree that we need not have a separate finding that she was under 14 since she has to be that in order . . . the jury found valcillo guilty on both counts, and found true all three of the one strike sentencing allegations on the guilty verdict form for count 1 and all of the enhancements on count 2. the court sentenced valcillo to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole on count 1, and life imprisonment on count 2, plus three years pursuant to section 12022.7, subdivision (a), and one year pursuant to section 12022, subdivision (b)(1). the judge stayed the sentence on count 2 pursuant to section 654. the court also imposed various fines and assessments, and awarded valcillo custody credits. valcillo appealed timely. 6 discussion a. valcillo forfeited his argument of instructional error, and any such error was harmless n general principles of law relevant to the issues raised by the evidence and necessarpeople v. martinez (2010) 47 cal.4th 911, 953.) we review arguments of instructional error de novo. (see people v. hamilton people v. posey (2004) 32 of review is applicable in assessing whether instructions correctly stat we determine whether any instructional error is harmless by examining the entire record. (people v. flood (1998) 18 cal.4th 470, 503; people v. campbell (2015) 233 cal.app.4th 148, 167; people v. jandres (2014) 226 cal.app.4th 340, 359.) 1. valcillo forfeited his argument of instructional error the trial judge instructed the jury with calcrim no. 301, which reads in its entirety as follows__________ which requires supporting evidence [if you decide (he/she) is an accomplice],] (the/the) testimony of only one witness can prove any fact. before you conclude that the the trial court did not instruct the jury with the bracketed portion of calcrim no. 301. however, in other instructions, the trial judge told the jury that [t]he defendant may not be convicted of any crime based on his out-of-the jury had to (calcrim no. 359; calcrim no. 200.) valcillo argues the trial court erred in failing to give the bracketed portion of calcrim no. 301. he contends the trial court should have given the bracketed -of-court 7 statements valcillo, however, forfeited this contention. whether valcillo forfeited his argument of instructional error depends on whether the jury instructions without the bracketed portion of calcrim no. 301 constituted an incorrect statement of law, or merely an incomplete statement of law. a party may not complain on appeal that an instruction correct in law and responsive to the evidence was too general or incomplete unless the party has requested appropriate clarifying or amplifying language.people v. palmer (2005) 133 cal.app.4th 1141, 1156; accord, people v. carrasco (2006) 137 cal.app.4th 1050, 1060-1061; see people v. nguyen (2015) 61 cal.4th 1015, 1051 f defendant believed the instruction was incomplete or misleading, he had the obligation ].) on a defendant need not object to preserve a challenge to an instruction that incorrectly states the law and affects his or her substantial rights.people v. mackey (2015) 233 cal.app.4th 32, 106; see  1259.) because valcillo did not request clarifying or amplifying language, he argues that the omission of the bracketed language of calcrim no. 301 resulted in an incorrect statement of the law that affected his substantial rights. (see people v. rodrigues corroboration requirement . . . is a su omitting the bracketed portion of calcrim no. 301 did not result in an incorrect statement of the law. the trial court instructed the jury with calcrim no. 301 in conjunction with calcrim no. 359, the latter of which states, the defendant may not be convicted of any crime based on [his] out-of-therefore, giving calcrim no. 301 without the bracketed portion was at most incomplete, not incorrect; if valcillo wanted the court to give the bracketed portion of the instruction, in addition to calcrim no. 359, he should have asked for it. because valcillo did not request appropriate clarifying or amplifying language, he forfeited his argument of instructional error. (see people v. palmer, supra, 133 cal.app.4th at p. 1156.) 8 2. any instructional error was harmless even if valcillo had not forfeited the argument, any instructional error was harmless bwould have been reached in the absepeople v. watson (1956) 46 cal.2d 818, 836 (watson); see people v. jones (2012) 54 cal.4th 1, 53 [evaluating of watson].) an instructional error is harmless where the evidence of guilt is overwhelming. (people v. carrington (2009) 47 cal.4th 145, 188; people v. covarrubias (2015) 236 cal.app.4th 942, 954.) there was overwhelming evidence, other than the out-of-court statement by valcillo, from which the jury could reasonably find that valcillo committed a forcible lewd act upon a child. alondra testified that attack, and she recognized valcillo. deputy jesse espinoza testified that alondra identified valcillo in the back of the patrol vehicle immediately after the attack. barajas testified that she heard a thump and a scream, after which she saw valcillo outside the house running away while pulling up his shorts or his pants, and she subsequently found alondra covered in blood. tovar testified and found it was valcillo. and deputy dimmitt testified that he observed scratches on . given this evidence, even if the court had read the bracketed portion of calcrim no. 301 in addition to calcrim no. 359, there is no reasonable likelihood that the result of the trial would have been any different. (see in re crew (2011) 52 cal.4th 126, 150 [a] reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcomepeople v. superior court (ghilotti) (2002) 27 cal.4th 888, 918 [under the harmless error standard of watson, even under the more stringent test in chapman v. california (1967) 386 u.s. 18, 24 (chapman), the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt in light of the totality of jury instructions provided and the overwhelming evidence ny instructional error was harmless under either standard. 9 b. the trial court did not err in imposing a one strike sentence section 667.61, also known as the one strike law, sets forth an alternative sentencing scheme that requires the trial court to sentence a defendant to a specified subdivision (c) of section 667.61, and certain factual allegations are found true, most of which concern the manner in which the offense was committed ( 667.61, subds. (d), people v. kelly (2016) 245 cal.app.4th 1119, 1126; see people v. mancebo (2002) 27 cal.4th 735, 738 ection 667.61 sets forth an alternative, harsher sentencing scheme for certain forcible sex crimespeople v. jones (1997) 58 cal.app.4th 693, 703 the trial court to sentence a defendant found guilty of committing a specified sexual offense under specified aggravating circumstances to an extremely lengthy indeterminate term either 15 years to life or 25 years to life, depending on the particular aggravating circumstances.) section 667.61, subdivision any person who is convicted of an offense specified in subdivision (c) . . . upon a victim who is a child under 14 years of age under one or more of the circumstances specified in subdivision (d) or under two or more of the circumstances specified in subdivision (e), shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for life without the possibility of parole as with the three strikes law and statutory sentencing enhancements, the jury must first decide whether all the elements of the underlying substantive crime have been proven. if not, it returns an acquittal and the case is over. if the jury convicts on the substantive crime, it then independently determines whether the factual allegations that would bring the defendant under the one strike sentencing scheme have also been people v. anderson (2009) 47 cal.4th 92, 102.) valcillo contends that the trial court erred by imposing a one strike sentence on count 1 because the jury did not separately find alondra was under the age of 14. valcillo acknowledges that the jury found true the three one strike allegations that the crime involved infliction of great bodily injury, use of a dangerous or deadly weapon, and was committed during a burglary. (see  667.61, subds. (d)(4), (d)(6), (e)(2), (e)(3).) he 10 argues, however, under the age 14 which was a separate factual allegation for each of these three 1. valcillo waived any objection to the form of the verdict in general, failure to object to the form of the verdict at trial results in a waiver of a challenge to the verdict form. (see people v. jones (2003) 29 cal.4th 1229, 1259; people v. bolin (1998) 18 cal.4th 297, 330-331; people v. toro (1989) 47 cal.3d 966, 976, fn. 6 [a]n objection to jury verdict forms is generally deemed waived if not raised , disapproved of on another ground by people v. guiuan (1998) 18 cal.4th 558, 568; see also keener v. jeld-wen, inc. n objection to a defective verdict must be made before the jury is discharged.) the that a party should not sit on his or her hands, but instead must speak up and provide the court with an opportunity to address the alleged error at a time when it might be fixed.people v. anzalone (2013) 56 cal.4th 545, 550.) , or merely fail to object to the verdict form, but affirmatively stipulated to the verdict form he now challenges. counsel for valcillo stipulated that the guilty verdict for count 1 did not need to include a separate enhancement allegation finding that alondra was under the age of 14. counsel for valcillo stated he was entering into the stipulation b age not an by stipulating that the guilty verdict form on count 1 did not need to ask the jury to find alondra was under the age of 14, valcillo waived any argument that the verdict form should have asked the jury whether alondra was under the age of 14. (see people v. jones, supra, 29 cal.4th at p. 1259; people v. bolin, supra, 18 cal.4th at p. 330.) valcillo argues the waiver exception in in re birdwell (1996) 50 cal.app.4th 926 applies. in birdwell the to the rule that failure to object to a defect in the verdict form wwhere the defect in the verdict forms is the omission of the degree of the crime, because this results in an unauthorized sentence(people v. jones, supra, 58 cal.app.4th at p. 715, citing 11 birdwell, 50 cal.app.4th at pp. 930-931.) the birdwell exception does not apply here because this case does not involve a verdict form that failed to include a degree for the substantive offense. the portion of the verdict form valcillo challenges on appeal does not concern a substantive offense at all. that valcillo, however, had a jury trial on the one strike sentencing allegations; his trial counsel did not waive his right to such a trial. trial counsel for valcillo waived any objection to the form of the verdict on the ground that the findings on the one strike allegations did not include a (second) finding that alondra was under the age of 14. 2. any defect in the verdict form regarding the one strike sentencing enhancement was harmless under watson, supra, 46 cal.2d 818 any error in the verdict form is harmless if it is not reasonably probable that valcillo would have obtained a more favorable result had the verdict form required the jury to find, after finding alondra was under the age of 14 for the purpose of convicting him of forcibly committing a lewd act upon child, that alondra was under the age of 14 for the purpose of the one strike allegations. under the more stringent chapman harmless error standard, an error in the verdict form is harmless if the people show that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. (chapman, supra, 386 u.s. at p. 24.) the people argue that the harmless error standard of watson applies to errors in the verdict form. (see people v. estrada (1997) 57 cal.app.4th 1270, 1276 [watson harmless error standard applied to submission of ambiguous jury form on special sentencing allegations under one strike law]; people v. jones, supra, 58 cal.app.4th at pp. 715-716 [watson test applied to error in verdict forms]; people v. trotter (1992) 7 cal.app.4th 363, 370-371 [watson standard applied to clerical error in verdict form].) valcillo, without distinguishing between the harmless error standards of watson and 12 chapman, simply argues that the error here was not harmless. we conclude that any error in connection with the verdict form was harmless under either standard. the undisputrecords, was that she was under the age of 14 at the time the crimes were committed. had the verdict form included a second place for the jurors to indicate alonda was under the age of 14, it is beyond any reasonable doubt they would have done so. any error in failing to include a separate finding in the verdict form that alondra was under 14 was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. therefore, the trial court properly imposed a one strike sentence under section 667.61. disposition the judgment is affirmed. segal, j. we concur: zelon, acting p. j. garnett, j.* *judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
