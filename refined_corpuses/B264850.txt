(people v. salmorin 4 (2016) 1 cal.app.5th 738, 742.) in particular, proposition 47 added section 490.2, subdivision (a), which provides in relevant grand theft, obtaining any property by theft where the value of the money, labor, real or personal property taken does not exceed nine hundred fifty dollars ($950) shall be considered petty theft and shall be punished as a misdemeanor u a felony sentence for an offense that is now a misdemeanor under proposition 47, may petition for a recall of that sentence and request resentencing in accordance with the statutes that were added or amended by proposition 47.

(romanowski, at p. 914.) on march 28, 2017 we asked the parties to submit supplemental letter briefs discussing romanowski and whether relief. both sides submitted letter briefs. the supreme court in romanowski held that section 490.2 reduces the punishment for theft of access card information valued at less than $950romanowski, supra, 2 cal.5th at p. 914.) the supreme court also held that courts should use the reasonable and fair market value the value of stolen access card information exceeds $950romanowski, at p. 914.) the supreme court explained that under this test the trial court identify how much stolen access card information would sell for. [citations.] the fact that stolen access card information is not sold legally does not relieve courts of this duty. . . . when a defendant steals property that is not sold legally, evidence related to the possibility of illegal sales can help establish re only in cases where stolen property would command no value on any market (legal or illegal) can courts presume that the value of stolen access information is de minimis.id. at p. 915.) 6 finally, the supreme court in romanowski clarified that, in the context of a section 1170.18 petition to recall a sentencerelief. (romanowski, supra, 2 cal.5th at p. 916.) the supreme court explainn some cases, the uncontested information in the petition and record of conviction may be enough for the petitioner to establish this eligibility. when eligibility is s felony sentence shall be recalled and the petitioner sentenced to a misdemeanor . . . unless the court, in its discretion, determines that resentencing the petitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to but in other cases, eligibility for resentencing may turn on facts that are not established by either the uncontested petition or the record of conviction. in these cases, required if, after considering the verified petition, the return, any denial, any affidavits or declarations under penalty of perjury, and matters of which judicial notice may be taken, the court finds there is a reasonable likelihood that the petitioner may be entitled to relief and the petitioners entitlement to relief depends on the resolution of an ibid.) the trial court in this case did not have the benefit of the romanowski. as the people concede, however, in , barrientosion (d),] is subject to the recall and resentencing provisions . . . enacted as part of therefore, we must reverse remand the matter for the trial court to determine whether the 7 value of the stolen access card information in this case was $950 or less. in her supplemental brief, barrientos asks us to reverse the are doing, and she suggests we should also direct the trial court to enter an order granting her petition. barrientos argues in her supplemental briefvalue of the stolen access card information did not exceed $950 and that [barrientos] does not pose an unreasonable risk of directing the trial court to grant the petition is not an appropriate remedy here. barrientos argues the record establishes her entitlement to relief under proposition 47 without further proceedings in the trial court because the fact . . . is an objective measure of the value of the access card the supreme court in romanowski, however, rejected that argument. (see romanowski, supra, 2 cal.5th at p. 914 the $950 threshold for theft of access card information must reflect a reasonable approxims value, rather than the value of what (if anything) a defendant obtained using that informationshe does not pose an unreasonable risk to public safety, the trial court did not reach that issue, and it is not appropriate for us to do so in this appeal. section 1170.18 requires that the determination of dangerousness must be made in the first instance by the trial court; it is not our role to find facts, especially on an incomplete record. (people v. bunyard (2017) 9 cal.app.5th 1237, 1246; accord, people v. contreras (2015) 237 cal.app.4th 868, 892; see people v. awad (2015) 238 cal.app.4th 215, 221- . . . vests with the trial 8 the task of reducing a conviction from a felony to a misdemeanor].) disposition the order is reversed. on remand, the trial court is directed to determine whether the value of the stolen access card information in this case was $950 or less. if the court finds the value is $950 or less, and barrientos is still serving a felony sentence for theft of access card or account information, the court is to resentence her to a misdemeanor, unless the court finds she would pose an unreasonable risk of danger under section 1170.18, subdivision (b). if the court finds the value is $950 or less, and barrientos is no longer serving a felony sentence for theft of access card or account information, the court is to reclassify her conviction as a misdemeanor under section 1170.18, subdivisions (f)-(h). segal, j. we concur: zelon, acting p. j. menetrez, j.* *judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
