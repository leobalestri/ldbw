(a)),2 felony possession of a short-barreled rifle or shotgun ( 33215), and misdemeanor receiving stolen property valued at less than $950 ( 496, subd. (a)). the trial court suspended imposition of sentence and placed baselyos on formal probation for three years, on condition, inter alia, that he spend 270 days in jail. it imposed a restitution fine, a suspended probation revocation restitution fine, a criminal conviction assessment, and a court operations assessment. ttermination of his probation, and thereafter additionally granted his request to dismiss the charges under section 1203.4. however, it denied s request to reduce the two felony firearm offenses to misdemeanors pursuant to section 17, subdivision (b). baselyos moved for reconsideration of the trial ruling, arguing that reduction was required because both crimes were wobblers. the people objected that one of the offenses in question was not a wobbler, and thus could not be reduced under section 17, subdivision (b). on november 2, 2018, the trial court 1 because the facts of the underlying case are irrelevant to the issue presented on appeal, we do not recite them here. 2 all further undesignated statutory references are to the penal code. 3 denied the motion, explaining: for a totally different reason. when reading 17(b), in the first 1203.4 and [the court] is under no obligation to grant 17(b). [] as indicated, these charges were serious. as i look at them, they baselyos timely filed a notice of appeal from the trial order. discussion offenses did not convert to misdemeanors under section 17, subdivision (b)(1) and the trial court denial of his motion was not erroneous baselyos contends that under section 17, subdivision (b), the trial court was required to grant his request to reduce his offenses to misdemeanors. he is incorrect. discretionary ruling on a motion to reduce a felony to a misdemeanor pursuant to section 17, subdivision (b), for abuse of discretion. (people v. mullins (2018) 19 cal.app.5th 594, 611.) where motion presents a question of law, we exercise independent review. (people v. willis (2013) 222 cal.app.4th 141, 144.) either a felony or a misdemeanor, by explicitly labeling the crime as such, (people v. park (2013) 56 cal.4th 782, 789; people v. tran (2015) 242 cal.app.4th 877, 885.) howconduct that varies widely in its level of seriousness. such chargeable or, in the discretion of the court, punishable as either a felony or a misdemeanor; that is, they are punishable either by 4 a term in state prison or by imprisonment in county jail and/or by people v. park, at p. 789; people v. tran, at p. 885.) for all purposes until imposition of sentence or judgment. [citations.] if state prison is imposed, the offense remains a felony; if a misdemeanor sentence is imposed, the offense is thereafter deemed a misdemeanor. [citation.](people v. tran, at p. 885.) possession of a short-barreled rifle or shotgun ( 33215) is year or imprisonment pursuant to subdivision (h) of section 1170, and is therefore a wobbler offense. ( 33215;  17, subd. (a); people v. park, supra, 56 cal.4th at p. 789 & fn. 4.) possession of a machinegun ( 32625, subd. (a)) is punishable by a fine not to exceed . . . $10,000 . . . , or by both that fine and by a fine, but without an alternate sentence to the county jail for a period not exceeding one year, may be punishable by imprisonment in the county jail not exceeding one year or by a (see people v. mauch (2008) 163 cal.app.4th 669, 675.) section 17, subdivision (b) governs reduction of wobbler offenses to misdemeanors. that statute states, in pertinent part: a crime is punishable, in the discretion of the court, either by imprisonment in the state prison or imprisonment in a county jail under the provisions of subdivision (h) of section 1170, or by fine or imprisonment in the county jail, it is a misdemeanor for all purposes under the following circumstances: [] (1) after a 5 judgment imposing a punishment other than imprisonment in the state prison or imprisonment in a county jail under the provisions of subdivision (h) of section 1170. [] . . . [] (3) when the court grants probation to a defendant and at the time of granting probation, or on application of the defendant or probation officer thereafter, the court declares the offense to be a 3 thus, offenses potentially could have become misdemeanors in one of two ways. first, under subdivision (b)(1) of section 17, a felony automatically converts to a misdemeanor when the judgment imposes a punishment other than imprisonment in state prison or in county jail pursuant to section 1170, subdivision (h)(1). (people v. kaufman (2017) 17 cal.app.5th 370, 396; people v. willis, supra, 222 cal.app.4th at p. 144.) second, the trial court, after considering the facts of the offense and characteristics, had discretion to reduce the firearm offenses to misdemeanors under subdivision (b)(3) of section 17. (people v. tran, supra, 242 cal.app.4th at p. 885; people v. superior court (alvarez) (1997) 14 cal.4th 968, 978.) under subdivision (b)(3), baselyos was not entitled to relief simply because he successfully completed probation. (people v. tran, at pp. 891892 a convicted defendant is not entitled to the benefits of section 17(b) as a matter of right. rather, a reduction under section 17(b) is an act of leniency by the trial .) reduction under subdivision (b)(3) is not automatic; 3 section 17, subdivisions (b)(2), (4), and (5) provide for other circumstances in which an offense is a misdemeanor, but none is applicable here. 6 wobbler becomes a isdemeanor for all under section 17(b)(3) only when the court takes affirmative steps to classify the crime as a (people v. park, supra, 56 cal.4th at p. 793; people v. glee (2000) 82 cal.app.4th 99, 103 felony can never be converted automatically to a misdemeanor subdivision (b)(3)].) the trial court denied request to reduce his offenses to misdemeanors on the ground the crimes were serious. baselyos does not argue that the trial court abused its discretion in so finding. accordingly, we do not address the question of whether the court abused its discretion under section 17, subdivision (b)(3). instead, baselyos argues that under section 17purposes. eduction to a misdemeanor should have been granted as a matter of right. superficial reading of the statute, unsupported by further analysis or citation to authority, is incorrect. when, as here, a court suspends sentence and grants formal probation, with a requirement that the defendant serve time in jail as a condition of probation, section 17, subdivision (b)(1) does not apply. is settled that where the offense is alternatively a felony or misdemeanor . . . and the court suspends the pronouncement of judgment or imposition of sentence and grants probation, the offense is regarded a felony for all purposes until judgment or sentence and if no judgment is pronounced it remains a felony (people v. esparza (1967) 253 cal.app.2d 362, 364365; people v. balderas (1985) 41 cal.3d 7 144, 203 & fn. 30 [where defendant pled guilty to a wobbler and was placed on probation without imposition of sentence, and the court never designated the crime a misdemeanor, the offense constituted a felony].) section 17, subdivision (b)(1) is inapplicable here because there was no judgment imposing a punishment other than imprisonment. the offenses were charged as felonies, baselyos pled to them as felonies, he was sentenced to felony probation, and the trial court denied his request to reduce the offenses to misdemeanors. a trial court order that a defendant serve jail time as a condition of probation is not a other than within the meaning of section 17, subdivision (b)(1). jail term that is imposed as a condition of probation is not a misdemeanor (people v. barkley (2008) 166 cal.app.4th 1590, 1596; people v. livingston (1970) 4 cal.app.3d 251, 254255 . . . was not sentenced to the county jail within the meaning of penal code section 17. his confinement was imposed as a condition of probation after conviction of a people v. camillo (1988) 198 cal.app.3d 981, 986, fn. 2 [jail time ordered as a condition of probation not constitute a sentence within the meaning of penal code section people v. soto (1985) 166 cal.app.3d 770, 774 sentence had not yet been imposed, the grant of summary probation did not constitute a misdemeanor so as to render conviction a misdemeanor for all ; people v. esparza, supra, 253 cal.app.2d at pp. 363365 [where trial court suspended imposition of sentence and placed appellant on probation on condition he serve time in county jail, appellant was not sentenced to jail for purposes of section 17; jail confinement 8 a condition of probation and did not constitute a sentence within the meaning of . . . section 17]; people v. moomey (2011) 194 cal.app.4th 850, 857 [a wobbler offense is deemed a felony unless reduced to a misdemeanor by the sentencing court; if no sentence is ever pronounced, the offense remains a felony].)4 and, there has been no judgment for purposes of section 17, subdivision (b)(1). the trial court suspended imposition of sentence. (see people v. soto, supra, 166 cal.app.3d at p. 774 trial court specifically when it granted summary probation and thus did not impose section 1203 defines probation as the suspension of either the imposition of sentence or the execution of sentence, with an order 4 where a defendant is placed on summary or informal probation for a wobbler offense, courts have held that, unless the sentencing court expressly reserved jurisdiction to later impose a felony sentence, the offense is automatically converted to a misdemeanor under section 17, subdivision (b)(1). (people v. kaufman, supra, 17 cal.app.5th at pp. 395397; people v. willis, supra, 222 cal.app.4th at pp. 145, 147; people v. glee, supra, 82 cal.app.4th at pp. 103105; people v. soto, supra, 166 cal.app.3d at p. 775 [where court placed defendant on summary probation, but suspended proceedings and specifically reserved jurisdiction to impose a felony sentence at a later date, the offense was not automatically converted to a misdemeanor].) a grant of informal or summary probation is a conditional sentence, and conditional sentences are authorized only in misdemeanor cases. (people v. kaufman, at p. 396.) therefore, ordering summary probation, the court classifie[s a] offense as a (ibid.; people v. willis, at p. 145; people v. glee, at p. 104.) kaufman, willis, and glee are inapposite here, because the trial court placed baselyos on formal probation, not summary probation. 9 of conditional and revocable release under supervision of a probation officer. ( 1203, subd. (a); people v. chavez (2018) 4 cal.5th 771, 781.) either form[] of probationsuspension of the imposition of sentence or suspension of the execution of sentenceresults in a final judgment. in a case where a court suspends imposition of sentence, it pronounces no judgment at all, and a defendant is placed on probatioudgment people v. chavez, at p. 781.) without a judgment imposing punishment other than imprisonment, section 17, subdivision (b)(1) was not triggered. (see people v. barkley, supra, 166 cal.app.4th at pp. 15951596; people v. livingston, supra, 4 cal.app.3d at pp. 254255; people v. esparza, supra, 253 cal.app.2d at pp. 364365.) in sum, under the circumstances present here, section 17, subdivision (b)(1) did not come into play because there was neither imposition of a punishment other than imprisonment, nor a judgment. accordingly, the trial court did not err by declining to grant motion under that subdivision. 10 disposition the not to be published in the official reports edmon, p. j. we concur: egerton, j. dhanidina, j.
