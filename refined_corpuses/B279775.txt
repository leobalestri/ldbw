[] 3. instructions, verdict and sentencing the court instructed the jury with calcrim nos. 520 and 521, defining the elements of first degree premeditated murder and second degree murder, as well as calcrim nos. 505, 506 and 510, explaining the requirements for a finding of self-defense as justifiable homicide and an accidental killing as excusable homicide. at the request of defense counsel did not instruct the jury on either imperfect self-defense or heat-of-passion voluntary manslaughter although the court was of the view there was sufficient evidence in the record to support those instructions. (see people v. barton (1995) 12 cal.4th 186, 198 11 the evidence would support a conviction for the offense, the defendant may not argue on appeal that in doing so the court people v. hardy (2018) 5 failure to instruct on a lesser included offense as a basis on which to reverse a conviction when, for tactical reasons, the defendant persuades a trial court not to instruct on a lesser included offense the jury convicted mccluskey of second degree murder and found true the special allegation he had personally used a firearm, but not true the special allegations he had personally a bifurcated bench trial the court found the prior serious felony strike conviction pursuant to section 1385. the court sentenced mccluskey to an aggregate state prison term of 30 years to life: 15 years to life for second degree murder, plus a consecutive 10-year term for personal use of a firearm and a consecutive five-year term for the prior serious felony conviction under section 667, subdivision (a). 12 discussion 1. the trial court did not err in permitting mccluskey to be impeached with his statements to law enforcement officers while in custody a. governing law s fifth amendment privilege against self-incrimination, the united states supreme court, in miranda, required law enforcement agencies to advise a suspect, before any custodial law that anything he says can be used against him in a court of law, that he has the right to the presence of an attorney, and that if he cannot afford an attorney one will be appointed for him prior to (people v. martinez (2010) 47 cal.4th 911, 947 (martinez), quoting miranda, supra, 384 u.s. at p. 479.) ral, if a custodial suspect, having heard and understood a full explanation of his or her miranda rights, then makes an uncompelled and uncoerced decision to talk, he or she has thereby knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently waived people v. cunningham (2015) 61 cal.4th 609, 642.) however, once a suspect invokes his or her right to remain silent or to counselthe invocation and immediately cease questioning him or her.

(innis, at pp. 300-301; people v. huggins (2006) 38 cal.4th 175, 198.) whether particular questioning or statements amount to interrogation or its functional equivalent depends time of the questioning, the nature of the questions, the conduct of the police and all other relevant circumstances. (see edwards v. arizona (1981) 451 u.s. 477, 482 [101 s.ct. 1880, 68 l.ed.2d 378]; people v. stewart (1965) 62 cal.2d 571, 579.) if questioning has ceased but the suspect initiates a statement to police, prohibit[s] the police from merely listening to his voluntary, (people v. hensley, supra, 59 cal.4th at p. 810; accord, people v. bradford (1997) 14 cal.4th 1005, 1034.) even if obtained in violation of miranda, statements that are otherwise voluntarily made may be used to impeach the harris v. new york (1971) 401 u.s. 222, 225 [91 s.ct. 643, 28 l.ed.2d 1]; people v. case harris noted that a defendant does not exclusionary rule has a deterrent effect on proscribed police conduct, sufficient deterrence flows when the evidence in question is made unavailable to the prosecution in its case in miranda cannot be perverted into a license to use perjury by way of a defense, free from the risk of confrontation with prior inconsistent (people v. nguyen (2015) 61 cal.4th 1015, 1075.) the harris rule applies to permit use of a statement obtained in violation of miranda whether the suspect invoked his or her right to remain silent or 15 asked for an attorney (oregon v. hass (1975) 420 u.s. 714, 723 [95 s.ct. 1215, 43 l.ed.2d 570]) and even if the officer conducting request for counsel with the objective of securing evidence for impeachment purposes.

(people v. seaton (2001) 26 cal.4th 598, 656; people v. polk defendant asserts in the trial court a specific ground for suppression of his or statements to police under miranda, that ground is forfeited on appeal, even if the defendant asserted people v. demetrulias section 353, subdivision (a), the objection or motion to strike must be both timely and specific as to its ground. an objection to evidence must generally be preserved by specific objection at the time the evidence is introduced; the opponent cannot make a (e.g., second, even if the trial court was mistaken in concluding the product of police 4 that he said this after his rights were read to him. he was counsel also complained he had not been given a transcript of the recorded interview. 17 interrogation, the prosecutor clearly announced during the watts in some combination of an accident and self-defense when watts swung a baseball bat at him. on cross-examination he denied telling the detectives that he had not shot anyone. under the harris rule the audio recording of mccluskey telling the to impeach his trial testimony, even if it was obtained in violation of miranda. reliance upon harris v. new york, supra, 401 u.s. 222 and oregon v. hass, supra, 420 u.s. 714 to justify use of court we look at the result reached by the trial court, not its mly established by authority, nor one resting upon a sounder basis of reason and propriety, than that a ruling or decision, itself correct in law, will not be disturbed on appeal merely because given for a wrong reason. if right upon any theory of the law applicable to the case, it must be sustained regardless of the considerations people v. zapien (1993) 4 cal.4th 929, 976.)5 5 was no miranda him of the opportunity to challenge the admissibility of the statement for impeachment purposes on the ground it was coerced or involuntary. (see new jersey v. portash (1979) 18 2. doyle error lacks merit a. governing law the use against a defendant of his or her silence after a postarrest invocation of rights following miranda admonitions violates due process. (doyle, supra, 426 u.s. at pp. 618-would be fundamentally unfair and a deprivation of due process to allopeople v. thomas (2012) 54 cal.4th 908, 936; people v. clark (2011) 52 cal.4th 856, 959.) the two defendants in doyle had made no postarrest statements to the police. when they testified at trial that they had been framed, the prosecutor asked on cross-examination why they had not told that story to the police when they were arrested. the trial court overruled defense objections to the ions. (doyle, at pp. 612-614.) the supreme court reversed the convictions, holding that miranda warnings implicitly assure suspects their silence will not be used against 440 u.s. 450, 459 [99 s.ct. 1292, 59 l.ed.2d 501] [testimony before a grand jury compelled by a grant of immunity cannot be people v. depriest (2007) 42 calthe fourteenth amendment precludes the admission of any involuntary statement obtained from a criminal suspect through objecting to the statement as involuntary regardless of the trial miranda.

(iddoyle unfairness of implicitly assuring a suspect that his silence will not be used against him and then using his silence to impeach an wainwright v. greenfield (1986) 474 u.s. 284, 291 [106 s.ct. 634, 88 l.ed.2d 623]; see people v. crandell (1988) 46 cal.3d 833, 878 [wainwright and doyle are founded on the notion that it is fundamentally unfair to use post-miranda silence against the defendant at trial in view of the implicit assurance contained in the miranda warnings that exercise of the right of silence will not the doyle his or her right to remain silent, but also to his or her invocation of the right to counsel. (people v. crandell, supra, 46 cal.3d at p. a] similar process of reasoning supports the conclusion that comment which penalizes exercise of the right to counsel is people v. huggins, supra, 38 cal.4th at p. 198.) b. mccluskey forfeited any claim of doyle error a specific and timely objection is required to preserve a claim of doyle error for appellate review. (people v. seumanu (2015) 61 cal.4th 1293, 1333; people v. collins (2010) 49 cal.4th 175, 202.) defense counsel did not object as a doyle violation to any of the -examination to interview with detectives gunner and morse. nor did he object during closing argument when the prosecutor again reviewed ents during that interview. rather, as discussed, counsel objected only to the failure of the prosecutor to provide a transcript of the interview before trial and questioned 20 made before he was given the miranda advisements. accordingly, the issue has been forfeited for appeal. c. there was no violation of the doyle rule even if the claim of doyle error were not forfeited, doyle rule is not violated when to counsel was received without objection and the remarks of the prosecutor did not invite the jury to draw any adverse inference from either the fact or the timing constpeople v. thomas, supra, 54 cal.4th at p. 936.) in people v. crandell, supra, 46 cal.3d 833 the prosecutor played a tape recording of a postarrest police interview with the defendant during which the defendant said he wanted an attorney. in closing argument the prosecutor invited the jury to play the recording during its deliberations and to listen to the idmentioned the invocation of counsel primarily as a point of reference within the taped interview to assist the jury in locating an area where the prosecutor believed that the tone of atements about the events of the preceding night crandell, at pp. 878-879.) the supreme court held there was no doyle violation explaining, a prosecutor may inquire into and comment id. at p. 879, internal quotation marks omitted.) 21 similarly, in people v. huggins, supra, 38 cal.4th 175 the killed the for an attorney only to show that the interview ended after id. at p. argument that this violated doyle. (huggins, at p. 199; see greer v. miller (1987) 483 u.s. 756, 764 [107 s.ct. 3102, 97 l.ed. 2d 618] [no doyle was not submitted to the jury as evidence from which it was allowed to draw an adverse inference]; see also people v. hughes (2002) 27 cal.4th 287, 332, fn. 4 [no doyle error if the evidence of penalize defendant by illustrating consciousness of guilt but instead to demonstrate a plan to destroy evidence].) the same analysis applies here. it was mccluskey, not the prosecutor, who first mentioned (without objection by defense counsel) that, in response to the miranda advisements by the detectives, mccluskey said he wanted to contact a lawyer. the recording of the interview simply confirmed what mccluskey had was used by the prosecutor to refer to the point during the interview wstatement used to impeach him on cross-examination. although and undermined the credibility of his claim he shot watts in self-defense, like the prosecutors in crandell and huggins, she did not invite the jury to draw any adverse inferences from the fact or 22 doyle error. d. mccluskey has not shown his counsel was constitutionally ineffective recognizing our likely finding any claim of doyle error was failure to do so constituted ineffective assistance of counsel.6 there could be no valid tactical reason to object to the miranda grounds, he argues,7 and not also assert doyle error. however, because there was no doyle error, the decision not to object, necessarily did not constitute ineffective assistance. (see people v. cudjo 6 a defendant seeking relief on the basis of ineffective below an objective standard of reasonableness under prevailing professional norms and that it is reasonably probable a more favorable determination would have resulted in the absence of people v. rices (2017) 4 cal.5th 49, 80; people v. johnson (2015) 60 cal.4th 966, 979-980; see strickland v. washington (1984) 466 u.s. 668, 687-696 [104 s.ct. 2052, 80 l.ed.2d 674].) 7 defense counsel did not object the statement olation of miranda because it was made after mccluskey had invoked his right to counsel or sought to terminate the interview. the sole, quasi-objection under miranda was the question whether the statement had been made before or after the miranda advisements were given. 23 admission of the evidence cannot establish ineffective assipeople v. diaz (1992) 3 cal.4th 495, 562 [failure to object to the admission of evidence is not ineffective assistance people v. garlinger (2016) 247 cal.app.4th 1185, 1193-1194 [same].) 3. mccluskey is entitled to a new sentencing hearing on october 11, 2017, while this appeal was pending, the governor signed senate bill no. 620, effective january 1, 2018 (stats. 2017, ch. 682,  2) amending section 12022.53 to give discretion to the trial court to strike a firearm enhancement in in the interest of justice pursuant to section 1385 and at the time of sentencing, strike or dismiss an enhancement otherwise required to be imposed by this section. the authority provided by this subdivision applies to any resentencing that may occur general agree remand is appropriate to permit the trial court, which previously exercised prior strike conviction, to exercise its new sentencing discretion on the firearm enhancement.
