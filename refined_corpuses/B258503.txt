(people v. rocha (1971) 3 cal.3d 893, 900, fn. 13; accord, people v. parks (1971) 4 cal.3d 955, 959 & fn. 1; people v. vidaurri (1980) 103 cal.app.3d 450, 462-463 & fn. 3.) the courts of appeal have held: to prove a violation of . . . section 245, subdivision (a), the prosecution must establish that a person was assaulted and that the assault was committed by the use of a deadly weapon or instrument . . . . assault with a deadly weapon is a general criminal intent crime (people v. parks, [supra,] 4 cal.3d [at p.] 959) and requires proof only of an attempt to commit a violent injury upon the person of another. it does not require proof that an injury occurred. (people v. herrera (1970) 6 cal.app.3d 846, 851.) the requisite intent for the commission of an assault with a deadly weapon is the intent to commit a battery. (people v. parks, supra, 4 cal.3d at p. 959.) moreover, when an act inherently dangerous to others is committed with a conscious disregard of human life and safety, the intent to commit a battery is presumed. (people v. lathus (1973) 35 cal.app.3d 466, 470.) (in re jose r. (1982) 137 cal.app.3d 269, 275; accord, people v. griggs (1989) 216 cal.app.3d 734, 739-740; see people v. aguilar (1997) 16 cal.4th 1023, 1036-1037.) 4 we apply the following standard of review: [w]e must determine whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime . . . beyond a reasonable doubt. we review the entire record in the light most favorable to the judgment below to determine whether it discloses sufficient evidencethat is, evidence that is reasonable, credible, and of solid valuesupporting the decision, and not whether the evidence proves guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. (people v. mincey (1992) 2 cal.4th 408, 432.) we neither reweigh the evidence nor reevaluate the credibility of witnesses. (people v. lindberg (2008) 45 cal.4th 1, 27.) we presume in support of the judgment the existence of every fact the jury reasonably could deduce from the evidence. (ibid.) (people v. jennings (2010) 50 cal.4th 616, 638-639; accord, people v. hajek and vo (2014) 58 cal.4th 1144, 1260.) defendant concedes he had the present ability to commit a violent injury. defendant reasons, however: there was no evidence he ever attempted to touch or batter anybody with the knife; he did not move the knife but simply held it; and the knife was never within striking range of and no effort was made to strike mr. steel. substantial evidence supported the jurys verdict. viewed in the light most favorable to the judgment, defendant ran at mr. steel swinging a knife. he held the knife in front of his body. defendant pointed the knife at mr. steel, moving it in an x fashion. defendant came within two to four feet of mr. steel. mr. steel testified that if he had not gotten up and jumped back he would have been cut. defendant eventually ceased his advance. but this occurred only when mr. steel reached for something to swing at defendant and ms. mirakian stepped between the two men. this was substantial evidence defendant committed a deadly weapon assault. b. new trial defendant sought a new trial on grounds of jury misconduct. defendant premised his motion on the jurys brief deliberationslasting only 17 minutes. the trial court 5denied the motion. our review is for an abuse of discretion. (people v. mccurdy (2014) 59 cal.4th 1063, 1108; people v. lightsey (2012) 54 cal.4th 668, 729.) we find no abuse of discretion. this case involved only one count. the charged crime had few elements. two eyewitnessesmr. steel and ms. mirakiancorroborated each other. and the trial lasted less than three days. there was compelling uncontradicted evidence of defendants guilt. under these circumstances, the trial court did not abuse its discretion and defendant was not denied any rights under the state or federal constitutions. (people v. weaver (2001) 26 cal.4th 876, 973-974; people v. williams (1997) 16 cal.4th 153, 229.) iv. disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports turner, p.j. we concur: kriegler, j. goodman, j. judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
