( 12022.53, subds. (b) & (e)(1), 12022, subd. (a)(1).) the jury found true the allegation that eleby personally used a firearm in five counts of conviction (counts 811, 14), but not true as to the remaining counts (17, 2122). ( 12022.53, subd. (b).) the trial court sentenced eleby to an aggregate term of 34 years 8 months, and means to a total term of 15 years in state prison. 1 codefendants keoki williams and daquinn epps were tried with eleby and means, but are not parties to this appeal. 2 undesignated statutory references are to the penal code. 3 during trial the court dismissed three counts of second degree robbery and two counts of kidnapping to commit robbery. the trial court dismissed the remaining nine counts of kidnapping to commit robbery after the jury failed to reach a verdict on those counts. 3 appellant means contends his convictions based on a theory of aiding and abetting for false imprisonment by violence ( 236) in count 8, and for second degree robbery ( 211) in counts 9, 10, 11, and 14 lack substantial evidentiary support. we agree. accordingly, we reverse appellant convictions on counts 8, 9, 10, 11, and 14, as well as the accompanying true findings on the firearm enhancements, and remand to the trial court for resentencing.4 appellant eleby requested that this court independently examine the entire record on appeal to determine whether it reveals any issues which, if resolved favorably to appellant, would result in reversal or modification of the judgment. (people v. wende (1979) 25 cal.3d 436.) based on a thorough examination of the record and further briefing from the parties, we have determined that convictions for false imprisonment by violence ( 236) in count 8 and for second degree robbery ( 211) in counts 10, 11, and 14, as well as the accompanying true findings on the firearm enhancements, find substantial support in the record. we therefore affirm the judgment as to appellant eleby. 4 the parties agree that the trial court incorrectly calculated the actual number of days appellant means spent in custody prior to sentencing. upon resentencing, appellant means should receive a total of 1,305 days of presentence custody credit. 4 factual background the november 23, 2011 robbery of radio shack in los angeles (counts 8-11, 14) agustin sandoval was the manager of a radio shack store in los angeles (radio shack, l.a.) on november 23, 2011. sandoval and employees daniel banuelos, juan gomez, jassi toney, denia green, and david hernandez were working that night to prepare for the upcoming black friday sale. as sandoval was heading toward the exit at the back of the store to get a coffee, eleby entered the front of the store wielding a black handgun. eleby, who was wearing a hoodie and a black baseball one of the men, codefendant keoki williams, wore a long black trench coat, black wig, and a designer backpack. banuelos saw one of the men point a gun at toney. the perpetrators quickly rounded up sandoval, banuelos, and the other store employees, as well as four or five customers, and moved them to a back room where they ordered the victims to lie face-down on the floor with their hands behind their backs. one of the men bound the hands and feet with white plastic zip ties. as the perpetrators searched for keys to open the cages containing smartphones and other high-end electronics, they removed two cell banueloss pocket. the men opened the cages and emptied them of merchandise valued at approximately $100,000, loading the before leaving the store, the perpetrators turned off the lights, disconnected the phone lines, and locked the back room. 5 the january 13, 2012 robbery of at&t affordable portables in gardena (counts 21, 22) ernesto gomez was the manager and jalysa harris the assistant manager of at&t affordable portables in gardena on january 13, 2012. that evening, about 7:45 p.m., eleby and another man entered the store. eleby, whom harris described as short, stocky, and dark-skinned, wore a red and blue plaid shirt eleby had a black or silver handgun and was carrying a black duffel bag. the other man was wearing something tan, possibly a plaid shirt, and carried a designer backpack. she promptly crouched down with her hands up. the two men then took harris and gomez to the back room and ordered them to open the store safes, which contained iphones, other smartphones, ipads, and sim cards. harris complied. the men ordered gomez and harris to lie face down on the floor, and eleby bound their hands with zip ties as he held his gun to their backs. the men then removed the merchandise from the safes, filling the brown designer backpack and black duffel bag they had brought with them. the men took about $900 from the cash register and left the store. gomez noticed that a small red crossover suv, possibly a ford explorer or expedition, which he had observed parked in front of the store just prior to the robbery, was gone after the robbery. the january 18, 2012 robbery of radio shack in culver city (count 17) lisa fabrizio, the manager of the radio shack store on sepulveda boulevard in culver city (culver city radio shack), 6 was working alone the morning of january 18, 2012. approximately 10:20 a.m. eleby and another man entered the store. one of the men wore a green plaid shirt, the other a brown plaid shirt, and they both wore gray baseball caps, one with the brown grip of a handgun in his waistband as the other man came around the counter and pulled fabrizio away from the register. they demanded that fabrizio take them to the area where the cell phones were stored. fabrizio led the men to the back room and opened the cabinet containing the high-end, expensive cell phones. one of the men had a brown leather backpack with designer logos on it. as he put on a pair of gloves, the other man took fabrizio to the bathroom where he bound her hands behind her back with zip ties. instructing fabrizio to stay there on the floor, he turned off the bathroom lights and left. during the incident, yonatan yihdego came into the store to make a purchase. a man wearing a dark, long-sleeved hoodie with the hood over his head approached yihdego from the back of the store. suddenly, the man pulled a gun, and pointing it at behind his back. the man pushed yihdego to the back of the store and into the bathroom where fabrizio was sitting on the floor with her hands tied behind her back. the man ordered with zip ties, turned off the light, and left. the men took money from the cash register and went out through a back door to the alley behind the store, setting off the door alarm. a surveillance video of the alley from the tire store south of the radio shack showed a silver gmc acadia back up to the rear 7 of the radio shack at 11:49 a.m. the vehicle pulled away at 11:56 a.m. cell phone records on january 13,

cell phone records prior to january, 2012. the investigation and events following the robberies on january 18, 2012, shanmugarajah purchased 22 cell phones from means for $1,850. police seized approximately 30 . serial numbers from four of those phones matched four of the phones taken in the culver city radio shack robbery. surveillance video from from january 18, 2012, showed a white infiniti pull into the parking lot, followed by a silver gmc acadia. the two vehicles parked, and several people exited. one of the men wore a plaid shirt and dark jeans. interior surveillance footage showed a male subject walk into the store carrying a large, dark-colored duffel bag. both vehicles pulled out of the parking lot at approximately the same time. police observed a silver gmc acadia parked on the street directly in front of the apartment building where means lived with his girlfriend on 99th place in westchester on january 18, 2012. means had rented a bronze kia borrego from enterprise rent-a-car on january 12, 2012, which he exchanged for a silver gmc acadia on january 14, 2012. fingerprints were found in the rear interior of the acadia, and a palm print found on the

shanmcheck card both in name, a large black duffel bag, an at&t wireless bag, a single blue glove, a cell phone, an affordable portables business card, and other personal items. discussion appellant means contends there is insufficient evidence of his participation in the november 23, 2011 radio shack, l.a. robberyeither as a direct participant or an aider and abettorto sustain his convictions on any of the charges arising out of that robbery. appellant eleby also raises a substantial evidence challenge to his convictions on several counts arising out of that robbery as to which there was no testimony from the victims. in assessing these claims, the light most favorable to the judgment to determine whether it contains substantial evidencethat is, evidence that is reasonable, credible, and of solid valuefrom which a reasonable 10 trier of fact could find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable (people v. avila (2009) 46 cal.4th 680, 701; people v. watkins (2012) 55 cal.4th 999, 10191020.) we draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the verdict and presume the existence of every fact the jury could reasonably deduce from the evidence that supports its findings. (people v. maciel (2013) 57 cal.4th 482, 515; people v. kraft (2000) 23 cal.4th 978, 1053.) we do not, however, limit our review to the evidence favorable to respondent. (people v. dominguez (2006) 39 cal.4th 1141, 1153; people v. johnson (1980) 26 cal.3d 557, 577.) and into the realm of speculation in order to find support for a judgment. a finding . . . which is merely the product of people v. memro (1985) 38 cal.3d 658, 695, overruled on other grounds by people v. gaines (2009) 46 cal.4th 172, 181, fn. 2; people v. marshall support a conviction. suspicion is not evidence; it merely raises a possibility, and this is not a sufficient basis for an inference of people v. thompson (1980) 27 cal.3d 303, 324.) indeed, reasonable trier of fact could determine beyond a reasonable people v. raley (1992) 2 cal.4th 870, 890people v. rios (2013) 222 cal.app.4th 542, 564.) prosecution relies mainly on circumstantial evidence. [citation.] 11 finds that circumstantial evidence is susceptible of two interpretations, one of which suggests guilt and the other innocence [citations], it is the jury, not the appellate court[,] circumstances might also reasonably be reconciled with a contrary finding does not warrant a reversal of the people v. harris (2013) 57 cal.4th 804, 849850.) further, testimony of a single witness is sufficient for the proof of any factpeople v. richardson (2008) 43 cal.4th 959, 10301031), and to (in re frederick g. (1979) 96 cal.app.3d 353, 366.)people v. white (2014) 230 cal.app.4th 305, 319, fn. 14.) i. substantial evidence does not support appellant convictions on counts 8, 9, 10, 11, and 14 arising out of the november 23 radio shack, l.a. robbery acknowledging that means was not physically present at the radio shack, l.a. robbery on november 23, 2011, the prosecution proceeded on an aiding and abetting theory, based on evidence connecting him to the january 13 and 18 robberies as well as his possession of a gucci backpack, a black handgun, and zip ties. of a crime when he or she, (i) with knowledge of the unlawful purpose of the perpetrator, (ii) and with the intent or purpose of committing, facilitating or encouraging commission of the crime, (iii) by act or advice, aids, promotes, encourages or instigates the commission 12 people v. hill (1998) 17 cal.4th 800, 851, quoting people v. cooper (1991) 53 cal.3d 1158, 1164.) who aids and abets a crime is guilty of that crime even if someone else committed some or all of the cr(people v. mccoy (2001) 25 cal.4th 1111, 1117.) own acts and own ibid.) our equired mental states and acts reusa crime committed by the direct perpetrator, (b) the aider unlawful intent and an intent to assist in achieving those conduct by the aider and abettor that in fact assists the people v. thompson (2010) 49 cal.4th 79, 116117; people v. maciel, supra, 57 cal.4th at p. 518.) respondent all but admits the lack of any evidence connecting means to the radio shack, l.a. robbery, but we disagree and find the evidence presented in this case wholly insufficient to support culpability as an aider and abettor in the november 23, 2011 radio shack, l.a robbery. the attorney general first cites the numerous similarities among the three robberies as evidence connecting means to the november 23, 2011 robbery: in each incident, eleby and one or two cohorts entered a mobile phone/electronics retailer with a gun, herded all employees and customers to a back room where the perpetrators 13 ties, and then helped themselves to cash and high-end cell phones and electronics which they loaded into various bags, including a designer backpack. but means was indisputably not present during any of the robberies, and the modus operandi common to all three robberies did not constitute evidence that means had knowledge of november 23, 2011, intended to facilitate that robbery, or did anything to assist them in the commission of the crime. similarly, possession of the gucci backpack and a gun5 as well as zip ties similar to those used in all three robberies after the commission of the third robbery does not support an inference that means had the requisite mens rea before or during the first robbery, or engaged in any conduct that in fact assisted the commission of that robbery. (see people v. maciel, supra, 57 cal.4th at p. 518; people v. thompson, supra, 49 cal.4th at pp. 116117.) finally, respondent argues connection to the november 23 radio shack, l.a. robbery by citing evidence of complicity in the january 13 and january 18 robberies. the attorney general thus claims that cell phone communications with his codefendants around the time of the two january robberies, ss of a cell tower near the culver city radio shack within an hour of that robbery, the fact 5 no witness from the radio shack, l.a. robbery identified the black handgun found in possession as the gun used in that robbery. moreover, one of the victims of the january 13 affordable portables robbery testified that one of the perpetrators carried a silver handgun, and the victim in the culver city radio shack robbery stated that the only part of the gun she sawthe gripwas brown. 14 that means rented the gmc acadia used in the third robbery, and his possession of four cell phones stolen in that robbery somehow establish knowledge, intent and conduct in connection with a robbery which occurred nearly two months earlier. specific intent when he or she knows the full extent of the uragement commission of the crime. (people v. beeman (1984) 35 cal.3d people v. maciel, supra, 57 cal.4th at p. 518.) the fundamental flaw in the argument here is that none of the evidence connecting means to the january 13 and january 18 robberies fills the gaps left by the sheer dearth of evidence that means communicated with his codefendants within a month of the november 23, 2011 robbery, had any knowledge or intent to facilitate that robbery, or engaged in any conduct which in fact assisted his codefendants in committing the radio shack, l.a. robbery. indeed, not a shred of evidence was presented that means even had any association with any of the codefendants before january 1, 2012, much less in november 2011. because the record contains no substantial evidence that means had any knowledge of the november 23, 2011 robbery, that robbery, or that means acted to facilitate that robbery in any way, we conclude that ounts 8, 9, 10, 11, and 14 must be reversed. 15 ii. substantial evidence supports appellant convictions on counts 8, 10, 11, and 14 eleby contends the evidence does not support his convictions arising from the radio shack, l.a. robbery in counts 8, 10, 11, and 14. specifically, eleby argues that because none of the victims in these counts testified at trial, there was no evidence to prove the element of force or fear as to the robbery charges, or the element of violence or menace required to prove the charge of false imprisonment. however, the testimony of every victim was not necessary to establish these elements in light of substantial evidence that eleby entered the radio shack that night wielding a gun with which he threatened harm and instilled fear in all the victims during the commission of the robbery and false imprisonment. we therefore reject appellant victions arising from the november 23 radio shack, l.a. robbery. the felony of false imprisonment by violence requires proof that consent, and no. 9.60) iolence the exercise of physical force used to restrain over and above the force reasonably necessary to effect the restraint a threat of harm express or implied by word or act.(caljic no. 9.60; people v. newman (2015) 238 cal.app.4th 103, 109.) an express threat or use of a deadly weapon is not people v. wardell (2008) 162 cal.app.4th 1484, 1491.) rather, where the evidence supports a finding that the defendans acts or words expressly or 16 impliedly threatened harm, the evidence is sufficient to support a conviction for false imprisonment by violence based on menace. (ibid.) here, there is no dispute that hernandez was one of the employees present in the radio shack, l.a. the night eleby and his cohorts robbed the store. the evidence showed that eleby walked into the store brandishing a handgun which he used to force hernandez and others to a back room where their hands and feet were bound. use of a gun in this manner constituted a clear threat of harm to hernandez (and others) if he resisted being sequestered in the back room of the store during the robbery, leaving no doubt that substantial evidence supports false imprisonment by violence. evidence was insufficient to establish the force or fear element of robbery as to counts 10, 11, and 14. personal property in the possession of another against the will and from the person or immediate presence of that person accomplished by means of force or fear and with the specific intent permanently to deprive people v. clark (2011) 52 cal.4th 856, 943.) as our supreme court has observed, the central element of the crime of robbery [is] the force or fear applied to the individual victim in order to deprive him of his property. (people v. gomez (2008) 43 cal.4th 249, 265.) the element of fear for purposes of robbery is satisfied when there is sufficient fear to cause the victim to comply with the unlawful demand for his property. (people v. morehead (2011) 191 cal.app.4th 765, 774; people v. davison (1995) 32 cal.app.4th 206, 212.) explicit testimony by the victim is not 17 required to establish fear. (people v. bordelon (2008) 162 cal.app.4th 1311, 1319; people v. cuevas (2001) 89 cal.app.4th 689, 698.) instead, fear may be inferred from the circumstances under which the property was taken. (morehead, at p. 775; people v. holt (1997) 15 cal.4th 619, 690.) fear may also be established in the absence of an express threat: an unlawful demand can convey an implied threat of harm for failure to comply, thus supporting an inference of the requisite fear.(morehead, supra, 191 cal.app.4th at p. 775; people v. brew (1991) 2 cal.app.4th 99, 104.) indeed, words, or circumstances reasonably calculated to produce fear is sufficient to establish the element. (brew, at p. 104; morehead, at p. 775; people v. bordelon, supra, 162 cal.app.4th at p. 1319.) the record in this case contains abundant evidence from which the jury could infer the requisite fear on the part of the victims of the radio shack, l.a. robbery. uncontradicted testimony established the presence at the store of the three named victims in counts 10, 11, and 14. the evidence showed that eleby entered the store wielding a gun, which he pointed directly at one of the victims. eleby and his accomplices ordered all of the store employees and customers to the ground and warned them not to move. the perpetrators then forced the entire group to a back room at gunpoint and bound their hands and feet with zip ties. after restraining the victims, eleby and his accomplices loaded cell phones and other high-end store merchandise into bags and left the store. on the strength of this evidence, the jury could reasonably infer that each of the named victims experienced fear as a result were calculated to produce fear and force compliance from each of 18 the victims. we therefore find substantial evidence in support of for robbery in counts 10, 11, and 14. disposition the judgment is affirmed as to appellant eleby. the judgment is reversed as to appellant convictions on counts 8, 9, 10, 11, and 14, as well as the accompanying true findings on the firearm enhancements. the cause is remanded to the trial court for resentencing. in all other respects, the judgment as to appellant means is affirmed. not to be published. lui, j. we concur: rothschild, p. j. chaney, j.
