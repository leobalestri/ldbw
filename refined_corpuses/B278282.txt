(people v. rivera (2015) 233 cal.app.4th 1085, 1089.) proposition 47 added several new penal code and government code sections, including penal code section 1170.18, and amended several penal code and health and safety code sections, including health and safety code section 11350. (rivera, at p. 1091.) 3 conviction on october 21, 2010, in los angeles county superior court case no. ba354746. on september 19, 2016, the trial court heard and denied the motion renders him ineligible for relief. cole timely appealed. discussion proposition 47 reclassified as misdemeanors certain criminal offenses that were previously classified as felonies or wobblers (crimes that can be punished as either felonies or misdemeanors) and established procedures for persons convicted of those crimes to have them resentenced or reclassified as misdemeanors. (people v. valencia (2017) 3 cal.5th 347, 355; people v. rivera, supra, 233 cal.app.4th at pp. 1091-1093.) possession of a controlled substance (health & saf. code,  11350) is one of the offenses that proposition 47 reduced from a felony to a misdemeanor. (valencia, at p. 355.) but penal code section 1170.18, subdivision (i), states that any person who has a prior conviction of an offense specified in penal code section 667, subdivision (e)(2)(c)(iv), is not entitled to relief under penal code section 1170.18. a person with a prior murder conviction is ineligible for relief. (pen. code,  1170.18, subd. (i), 667, subd. (e)(2)(c)(iv).) shows that he was convicted of murder in case no. ba354746. his conviction in that case was affirmed on appeal.

(people v. woodell (1998) 17 cal.4th 448, 457.) as cole concedes, the record of conviction is a proper basis for determining the existence of a prior conviction for purposes of penal code section 1170.18. (people v. hall (2016) 247 cal.app.4th 1255, 1263.) the opinion in his appeal conclusively establishes that he was convicted of murder and that he therefore is not entitled to relief. 5 disposition the order is affirmed. menetrez, j.* we concur: perluss, p. j. segal, j. * judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
