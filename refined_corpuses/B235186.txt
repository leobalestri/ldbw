(d), (e)) and committed the crime for the benefit of a criminal street gang (id.,  186.22, subd. (b)(1)(c)). the trial court sentenced gomez to state prison for a term of 50 years to life. on appeal, gomez challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support his conviction. he also argues that the judgment should be reversed because of evidentiary error, prosecutorial misconduct, ineffective assistance of counsel, sentencing error, judicial bias, and an erroneous restitution order. we correct the amount of the restitution order and otherwise affirm the judgment. facts a. the shooting on july 29, 2008 at approximately 8:00 p.m. two members of the eastside trece gang murdered marcus van ellis because he was wearing red, the color of a rival gang. the two gang members shot 10 to 15 rounds at van ellis as he fled. van ellis was shot five times, including once in the back. van ellis was transported to los angeles county medical center, where he was pronounced dead at 9:45 p.m. from multiple gunshot wounds. the murder occurred on east adams boulevard between stanford avenue to the west and griffith avenue to the east, about 100 feet from the griffith avenue intersection. ace liquor is at the northwest corner of the griffith avenue intersection, a childcare center is west of the liquor store at 853 east adams boulevard, and a single 3 family residence is west of the childcare center, at 847 east adams boulevard. van ellis was shot in front of the single family residence. the east side trece gang, a latino gang, and the 20 outlaws, an african-american gang, controlled the area where van ellis was killed. b. the eyewitnesses 1. erick cuevas erick cuevas was watching television in his third-floor apartment on the south side of east adams boulevard, west of griffith avenue, when he heard a gunshot and looked out the window. he saw an african-american man running west on adams in the middle of the street, approximately 20 to 30 feet from cuevas. it was still daylight and there was nothing obstructing his view. cuevas saw two latino men wearing blue clothing running from the southwest corner of adams and griffith and chasing the african-american man. they had their arms extended and fired 10 to 15 shots. the two latino men appeared to say something, but cuevas could not hear what they said. after the african-american man fell to the ground, the two latino men ran back toward griffith. cuevas then heard the sound of screeching tires. according to cuevas, one of the latino men was 25 to 26 years old, five feet, four baggy the shooting. 2. arlene stewart street and central avenue when a black cadillac caught her attention.1 the cadillac was 1 central avenue is two blocks east of griffith avenue, and 28th street is two blocks south of east adams boulevard. 4 headed west on 28th street, and it turned right toward east adams boulevard. the as halfway down, and stewart saw three latino men in the car. she recognized gomez, who was sitting in the back seat, as someone she had known for several years, although she did not know his name. she also recognized the cadillac because she had seen it as stewart was walking north toward 27th street she saw the cadillac turn left into a valero gas station on the southwest corner of east adams boulevard and central 3. jose ramirez jose ramirez was jogging in the area of east adams boulevard and griffith avenue. he grew up in the area and frequently ran five to six miles a day in the neighborhood. at the time ramirez was in the police academy, and he subsequently became an officer with the los angeles police department. as ramirez was jogging on east adams boulevard approaching stanford avenue he saw two young latino men with thin builds wearing baggy clothing and looking upset. demeanor, the nevertheless made eye contact with one of the men, whom he later identified as gomez. he described gomez as bald with a dark complexion, wearing a hooded sweatshirt and 5 ramirez heard what sounded like gunfire or fireworks. he kept on running, common in the area for running the other way. a group of people was gathering about 100 feet from the griffith avenue intersection. c. the investigation 1. los angeles police officer sharlton wampler officer sharlton wampler was one of the first officers to arrive on the scene. he observed van ellis unconscious on the sidewalk and a group quickly. officer wampler interviewed two witnesses, luis salas and trevon smith, who gave him information about a black cadillac. officer wampler had stopped a black several weeks earlier. 2. los angeles police detective rudolfo chong homicide detective rudolfo chong, who was assigned to investigate the shooting, arrived at about 11:10 p.m. and spoke with officers on the scene. detective chong obtained the evidence the officers had collected from the area, including bullet jackets and fragments, but no expended shell casings. he observed bullet holes and impact marks at the childcare center and the residence to the west of it. he also observed bullet holes in and bloodstains on a car parked in a driveway just to the west of the residence. one of the officers at the scene told detective chong that the security camera at the childcare center might have recorded the shooting. detective chong contacted the owner of the center and was able to view the video recording. the recording showed an unidentified latino man wearing orange shorts, standing next to a black truck parked on the north side of the street. it also showed two men chasing van ellis. one of the two 6 men appeared to be about five feet, four inches tall. the other man was about five feet, six inches tall and thinner. gomez is five feet, one inch tall. the recording showed van ellis wearing a black shirt and red shorts. in that area ellis was not a gang member, but he lived at 817 east adams boulevard, which was a the recording also showed a dark-colored cadillac with soft or different-colored top. detective chong was interested in the car because the shooters came into the picture about 30 seconds after the cadillac turned onto griffith avenue. after the shooting, the shooters ran back in the direction the cadillac had travelled. detective chong spoke to officer wampler, who told him he had stopped a black cadillac with east side trece gang members in it in the same area. he had written a ticket and impounded the cadillac. he remembered that the registered owner of the cadillac lived on city terrace drive. detective chong then spoke to luis salas, one of the witnesses who had spoken to officer wampler about the black cadillac on the night of the shooting. salas said that the car was a green cadillac with a brown top, and he had seen it driven by an older man who worked at the police garage. salas also said that the suspects had entered a black cadillac and had shouted the name of their gang, the east side trece gang.2 a couple of days later, salas told detective chong that the cadillac had tinted windows and whitewall tires. detective chong was unable to interview trevon smith, the other witness who had spoken to officer wampler. smith had told officer wampler that the car was a said he saw it parked on the west side of griffith avenue, south of east adams 2 7 boulevard. some of the 911 callers who reported the shooting also described the car as a black cadillac with a rag top. detective chong went to the city terrace drive address of the registered owner of the black cadillac that officer wampler had stopped and took photographs of the car. it had a hard top and did not have tinted windows or whitewall tires. nine months after the shooting, on april 29, 2009, detective chong showed cuevas a binder containing five pages of photographs, each page containing six photographs of latino men. detective chong asked cuevas if he saw a photograph of either of the men who shot van ellis. while cuevas recognized two of the men in the photographs, neither was the shooter. he explained to detective chong that he did not e did not remember the faces. 3. los angeles police detective julio benavides homicide detective julio benavides took over investigation of the case from detective chong. detective benavides used a computer to generate a six-pack photographic lineup containing a photograph of gomez. on october 8, 2009 he showed the lineup to ramirez. ramirez identified gomez as the man with whom he made eye contact before the shooting.3 on october 13, 2009 detective benavides spoke to cuevas at his apartment. althoto come with him to the police station. at the station detective benavides showed the h4 3 on cross-examination ramirez said he was about 70 percent sure of his identification. 4 on cross-sure of his identification of gomez. he also testified that he felt pressured by detective benavides to make an identification. 8 detective benavides also spoke to stewart in october 2009. while it did not appear that she had given any useful information to detective chong, detective benavides wanted to check her level of cooperation and determine whether she had information that would help with his investigation. stewart was in prison at the time of her interview. detective benavides did not make any promises to stewart in exchange for her cooperation. stewart told detective benavides what she had observed. he showed her the photographic lineup, and she identified gomez as one of the two men she had seen in the back seat of the cadillac. she also identified daniel salgado and miguel diaz as the other two men in the car. d. gomez was arrested on october 14, 2009 at his residence at 1101 east 29th street, where gomez lived with his grandmother and uncle. detective benavides searched the residence and recovered from one of the bedrooms a number of items it addressed to 1101 east 29th street and and photographed gang graffiti in graffiti. on may 12, 2011, during the trial, los angeles county deputy sheriff david found a folder containing personal papers, a handwritten document, and a document brownside is the name of a hip hop group, and 9 similar to the lyrics of the brownside song. . . rab ur gun. we gon kill some . . that latino gang members use to refer to african-americans. e. gang evidence los angeles police officer ronald berdin, assigned to the newton division gang enforcement detail, testified as an expert on the eastside trece or eastside 13 gang. roup of individuals who were tired of being victimized started this particular gang within this particular area, gang currently had about 90 members and as of the time of trial officer berdin had boulevard on the north, 32nd street on the south, hooper avenue on the east, and griffith avenue on the west. its main rival gangs were the two blood gangs, the rolling 20 outlaws and the rolling 30 pirus, which has a close alliance with the 20 outlaws. the gangs had been fighting since 2005 or 2006, when members of the rolling 20 outlaws and rolling 30 pirus believed an eastside 13 member had killed one of their members, which led to escalating retaliation. officer berdin stated that the particular feud between these three gangs was one of the most active he had seen during the 16 years he had been on the job. the primary activities of eastside 13 included vandalism, robberies, assaults, and . . with one another regularly. that, in and of itself, creates a sense of fear and intimidation 10 erdin gave examples of two eastside 13 gang members who had been convicted of attempted murder, one in 2005 and one in 2006. individual who joins a gang must gain the respect and trust of the other gang members. to do that, he must commit crimes and show his willingness to participate in gang activities. the more serious the crime, the more respect is earned. gangs use the term uch as confronting rival gang members, going into their territory and putting gang graffiti on their walls, and committing crimes in their territory. were killers of members of the rolling 20 outlaws and rolling 30 pirus gangs. officer berdin knew that gomez, salgado, and diaz were members of eastside 13 from contacts with them by him and other officers, and from photographs. gomez told officer berdin in 2008 that he was a member of eastside 13 and his gang moniker was eastside 13. an envelope on which the numerals 2 and 3 had been crossed out indicated disrespect for the rolling 20 outlaws and the rolling 30 pirus. the yearbook had writing in it stating that eastside 13 had killed someone. matthew g.-year-old cousin, testified for the defense. at the time gomez was arrested in october 2009 matthew g. was 11 or 12. he lived at 1101 east 29th street with his grandmother and gomez and testified that the yearbook the police found when they searched the residence belonged to him, not gomez.5 matthew 5 on cross-examination matthew stated that gomez did not live at the 29th street residence, but would come over so that his grandmother would heal cuts on his body, 11 g., who was not in a gang, said that he wrote the gang graffiti and other statements in the yearbook because he thought the writing was cool and funny, although he later realized it was dumb to write those things. matthew g. kid, i used to see it on the street and stuff, and i would be like, wow, writing, like i would want to have like cool writing like that, you know. so like i would officer berdin viewed the video recording from the childcare center. based on the recording and a hypothetical question mirroring the facts of the case, he characterized the . . a gang-rolling 20 outlaw and rolling 30 pirus territory, and van ellis was wearing red shorts, common clothing worn by members of the two blood gangs.6 in addition, by committing this crime during the day, eastside 13 members were sending a message to witnesses that they could commit this type of crime at any time without fear of retribution or identification. such conduct would instill fear and make witnesses unwilling to come forward when the gang members committed crimes, and allow gang members to continue committing crimes without fear that they would be caught. f. expert testimony regarding eyewitness identification dr. kathy pezdek is a cognitive psychologist who testified as an eyewitness identification expert for the defense. she reviewed the police reports, transcripts of witness interviews, and the video recording of the incident. dr. pezdek testified that when someone sees a person very briefly, he or she does not remember that person exactly, as he or she would a photograph or video. thus, the video recording of the incident was not representative of what a witness would remember. according to dr. pezdek, there are five factors affecting the accuracy of eyewitness identifications. the first is the exposure time or the amount of time the 6 officer berdin testified that van ellis was an associate of the rolling 30 pirus gang. he congregated with gang members but did not commit crimes. 12 witness was able to view the face of the perpetrator. the less exposure time, the less accurate the identification. the second factor is distraction, which relates to other activity occurring at the time the witness viewed the perpetrator. the greater the distraction, particularly in the form of another participant in the crime, the less time the of the reliability of an eyewitness identification. dr. pezdek explained that memory is not a perfect storage system and fades with the passage of time. the longer the delay in making an identification, the higher the misidentification rate. the fourth factor is experimenter expectancy. if the officer conducting a photographic lineup knows the identity of the suspect, the officer might inadvertently give clues to who the suspect is. if the eyewitness is unsure of his or her ability to make an identification, he or she might look to the officer for suggestions or guidance. the fifth factor is an admonition given to the eyewitness at the time of the photographic lineup that the suspect may or may not be in the lineup. this warning reduces the probability of a misidentification.7 dr. pezdek cautioned that even well-intentioned eyewitnesses trying to do their best are going to make misidentifications. discussion i. sufficiency of the eyewitness identification evidence a. gomez waived his objection to the admission of the eyewitness identification evidence impr 7 detective benavides gave cuevas this admonition. 13 people point out, however, gomez did not object to the admission of the eyewitness identification evidence at trial. the failure to object to the admission of eyewitness identification evidence waives any challenge to its admission on appeal. (people v. cunningham (2001) 25 cal.4th 926, 989; see evid. code,  well as claims based on violations of fundamental in re seaton (2004) 34 cal.4th 193, 198; see people v. rodrigues (1994) 8 cal.4th 1060, 1116, fn. 20 [failure to raise due process claims with respect to the admission of evidence by objection at trial waives those claims on appeal].) thus, to the extent gomez is violated his due process rights, gomez waived the argument by failing to object in the trial court. gomez also waived his argument that the identification procedure was unduly sic]: so i read you the admonition, i wantthethe admonition about this photo lineup. i want you to look at these pictures and do the right thing, erick, okay. which of these pictures do you thinkbrings something back to memory for you? that one? number five? uess, yeah. sic]: number five? the transcript does not show whether detective benavides suggested number five and cuevas then picked that photograph, or whether cuevas first selected number five and detective benavides then sought to confirm his selection. both attorneys questioned cuevas at trial regarding his identification of number five. cuevas stated that detective benavides did not make him think that that the suspect was definitely in the group of photographs detective benavides showed him, and that he selected number 14 counsel objected to the identification based on the transcript, the trial court could have held a hearing to determine whether the identification procedure was unduly suggestive and therefore should have been excluded. (people v. cunningham, supra, 25 cal.4th at p. 989; see people v. avila people v. desantis s as a waived. (cunningham, supra, at p. 989; desantis, supra, at p. 1222.) b. there was sufficient evidence of identification in assessing the sufficiency of the evidence to support a conviction, the whole record to determine whether any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime or special circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt. [citation.] the record must disclose substantial evidence to support the verdicti.e., evidence that is reasonable, credible, and of solid valuesuch that a reasonable trier of fact could find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. [citation.] in applying this test, we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution and presume in support of the judgment the existence of every fact the jury could reasonably have deduced from subject to justifiable suspicion do not justify the reversal of a judgment, for it is the exclusive province of the trial judge or jury to determine the credibility of a witness and the truth or falsity of the facts upon which a determination depends. [citation.] we resolve neither credibility issues nor evidentiary conflicts; we look for substantial d people v. zamudio (2008) 43 cal.4th 327, 357; see people v. albillar (2010) 51 cal.4th 47, 59-60.) this standard 15 applies to the sufficiency of eyewitness identification evidence to support a conviction. (see people v. williams (1997) 16 cal.4th 153, 248; people v. cuevas (1995) 12 cal.4th 252, 274-275.) gomez points to problems with the eyewitness identifications in this case, including discrepancies between his appearance and the initial descriptions given by the , and the lack of physical evidence connecting gomez to the crime. none of these issues mandates reversal of [citatipeople v. mendez (2010) 188 cal.app.4th 47, 59.) we can reject an physically impossible, or the falsity of the identification is apparent without resorting to inference or deduction. (people v. thompson is clearly shown that under no hypothesis is there sufficient evidence to support it. mendez, suprato justifiable suspicion do not justify the reversal of a judgment, for it is the exclusive province of the . . . jury to determine the credibility of a witness and the truth or falsity of the facts upon which a determination depends. [citation.] we resolve neither credibility people v. letner and tobin (2010) 50 cal.4th 99, 161-162.) three eyewitnesses identified gomez as one of the shooters. counsel for gomez had the opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses regarding the accuracy of their s affecting the accuracy of eyewitness identifications. defense counsel had the opportunity circumstances, the jury was able to evaluate the credibility of [the eyewiidentifications], and the weight [their] testimony deserved was for the jury to resolve. . . . 16 [] in sum, there was substantial evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude, people v. boyer (2006) 38 cal.4th 412, 481.) c. the amended information had no effect on the verdict the original information filed on may 10, 2010 alleged that the murder occurred handwritten above it. at the start of trial on may 4, 2011, the trial court told the prospective jurors that the information alleged a murder occurring on or about july 29, 2008. the people filed an amended information on may 15, 2011, again alleging that the murder occurred on or about july 29, 2009, and gomez was arraigned on the amended information on may 16, out of the presence of the jury. gomez argues that the amended information superseded the original (muns v. superior court (1955) 137 cal.app.2d 728, 732), and that it was impossible for him to have murdered van ellis on july 29, 2009. gomez argues that as a result of the typographical error on the amended information, the verdict was based on a void document and the resulting confusion caused by the amended information requires a new trial. (see people v. mack (1961) 197 cal.app.2d 574, 580-581.) as a general rule, information. (see people v. kemp (1961) 55 cal.2d 458, 474; people v. ramirez (2003) 109 cal.app.4th 992, 997.) in any event, where the date the crime was committed is not offense was commpeople v. peyton (2009) 176 cal.app.4th 642, 660.) in addition, because the trial court did not read the amended information to the jury, the amended information with the incorrect year on it could not have caused any confusion or prejudice. 17 ii. introduction of gang evidence gomez challenges the introduction of the yearbook found in his residence, the police notebook on the eastside 13 gang, and the rap song lyrics found in his cell. he contends the evidence was irrelevant, inflammatory, and prejudicial, mandating reversal of his conviction. the trial court, however, did not abuse its discretion in admitting any of this evidence. a. standard of review s and gang membership for abuse of discretion. (people v. carter (2003) 30 cal.4th 1166, 1194; people v. waidla (2000) 22 cal.4th 690, 717.) gang evidence is admissible when it is relevant to a material issue at trial. as the california supreme court has stated, including evidence of l enterprises, rivalries, and the likecan help prove identity, motive, modus operandi, specific intent, means of applying force or fear, or other issues pertinent to guilt of the people v. hernandez (2004) 33 cal.4th 1040, 1049.) gang evidence people v. ruiz (1998) 62 cal.app.4th 234, 239; see people v. gonzalez (2005) 126 cal.app.4th 1539, 1550.) evidence code section 352 gives the trial court the discretion to exclude relevant evidence if the probative value of the evidence is substantially outweighed by the probability that its admission will create a substantial danger of undue prejudice, confusing the issues, or misleading the jury. (people v. harris (2013) 57 cal.4th 804, court has abused its discretion (people v. minifie (1996) 13 cal.4th 1055, 1070), in other words, if its decision exceeds the bounds of reason (people v. desantis, supra, 2 cal.4th 18 at p. 1226). gang evidence does have a potential for prejudice. (people v. carter, supra, 30 cal.4th at p. 1194; people v. albarran (2007) 149 cal.app.4th 214, 223.) when it meets the test of relevancy, however, it is admissible unless its prejudicial effect clearly outweighs its probative value. (carter, supra, at p. 1194; people v. cardenas (1982) 31 cal.3d 897, 904-905.) b. the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the evidence of gang membership 1. the yearbook counsel for gomez first objected to the admission of the yearbook on the ground he police found it, and detective benavides responded that the police found it in the house where the officers arrested gomez. the trial court stated that was probably enough to connect the yearbook to gomez and that the defense could argue that it was no writings in the yearbook that might prejudice the jury. for example, there was a picture of an african- in the book. the prosecutor responded that the police found the yearbook in a bedroom with an envelope addressed to gomez, with the same type of writing and objection 19 -american people in the yearbook and the notation was over only one picture, with no indication of a gang motive, the court would exclude the evidence as highly inflammatory under evidence code section 352. at a later break in the proceedings, the trial court noted that it had looked at the -american. the trial court had also looked through the entire yearbook and found other potentially prejudicial comments. the court invited defense counsel to review the yearbook to see if there were any other objections he wanted to make. the prosecutor later brought to the attention of the trial admit the comment to show gang membership and motive, but it would allow defense counsel to argue the issue the following day. the police had discovered the yearbook 14 months after the commission of the crime and that the comment was are talking about what happened to our person who was killed in this case. so that one a limited purpose, that this is counsel for gomez then objected to a page on which there was an x over the face agreed that this page was more prejudicial than probative and would be excluded. 20 counsel also objected to a picture of an asian woman with an x over her face and the sic ion one last page to which he objected. this page had an x over the picture of a african-american faculty member it. the trial court excluded the thority on the issue. the court also ordered the the next day the trial court ruled it was going to allow evidence of the comment it was prejudicial but found the probative value outweighed the prejudicial effect. the court was prepared to give the jury a limiting instruction stating that the comment could not be considered for the truth of the matter but only as indicia of gang membership. later that day, the trial court discussed admission of the rap lyrics that the deputy court would tell the jury that if it found, by comparing the lyrics to the writing in the yearbook, that the determination that the comment was an admission. later, when counsel for gomez questioned matthew g. about the writing in the yearbook, including some of the handwritten comments that the trial court had previously terms othe book. [the witness is] claiming ownership . . matthew g. 21 matthew g. claimed he had written all of the comments. [matthew g.]to commit the crime. (see people v. hernandez, supra, 33 cal.4th at p. 1049; people v. ruiz, supra, 62 cal.app.4th at pp. 239-240.) and whether the yearbook belonged to gomez or matthew g. was a factual issue for the jury. while matthew g. testified that it was his, the police found it in a room with items that appeared to belong to gomez. with respect to the comments in the yearbook that the trial court excluded but that counsel for gomez subsequently questioned matthew g. about, the people correctly point out that any error in the admission of those comments was invited. where a defendant elicits evidence previously ruled inadmissible, he cannot claim error on appeal based on the admission of the evidence.

(guerra, supra, at pp. 1159-1160; people v. coffman and marlow (2004) 34 cal.4th 1, 127.) there is a strong presumption that the trial court properly 33 exercised its discretion, so abuse must appear clear and unmistakable.
