(people v. brown (may 11, 2000, b130672) [nonpub. opn.].) under these circumstances, the record establishes that defendant was available for offensive or defensive use(osuna, supra, at p. 1029; brimmer, supra, at p. 796.) any doubt as to this issue is, of in the commission of possession of cocaine base for purpose of sale. as defendant recognizes, courts have repeatedly rejected his contention that disqualification from proposition 36 relief requires that arming with a firearm must be defendant posits various arguments designed to convince us that section 1170.126 should nonetheless be construed as precluding a finding that a defendant convicted merely possessing a firearm, without any other offense, is ineligible for resentencing relief. we find none convincing.people v. white (2016) 243 cal.app.4th 1354, 13631365 the electorate was entitled to draw a line decreeing that any third strike felon who was actually armed with a prohibited firearmno matter how benign the circumstanceswas categorically 4 ineligible for resentencing reliefbrimmer, supra, 230 cal.app.4th at p. 797 [rejecting that possessory offenses can never fall under the armed with a firearm exclusion, because one cannot use, or be armed with a of such offenses without another separate or tethering offensepeople v. elder (2014) gun possession come within our interpretation of this eligibility criterion, it would not run people v. blakely (2014) 225 cal.app.4th 1042, 1054 [a defendant convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm is disqualified from relief if the defendant had the firearm he or she was convicted of possessing available for use, either offensively or defensively]; osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1032 we conclude the literal language of the act disqualifies an inmate from resentencing if he or she was armed with a firearm during the unlawful possession of that firearm we agree with the above-cited authorities. defendant was armed with a firearm during the commission of count 2. the petition for relief under proposition 36 was properly denied. disposition the judgment is affirmed. kriegler, j. we concur: turner, p.j. baker, j.
