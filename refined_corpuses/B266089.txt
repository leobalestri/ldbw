(a)(1)) and admitted he had suffered three prior strike convictions for robbery. the trial court sentenced him under the three strikes law to 25 years to life in prison. in december 2012, tyler filed a petition to recall his sentence under the three strikes reform act of 2012, added by proposition 36, approved by the voters on november 6, 2012, which permits an inmate serving an indeterminate life sentence under the three strikes law for a nonviolent, nonserious felony to seek a new, lesser sentence unless resentencing would pose an unreasonable risk to public safety. ( 1170.126, subds. (b), (e), (f).) after reviewing victim testimony given at the preliminary hearing, the trial court found tyler was ineligible for resentencing because he had been armed with and used a firearm during the commission of his offense. tyler timely appealed. discussion tyler contends he is eligible for resentencing. we disagree. 1 all further statutory references will be to the penal code. 3 section 1170.126 was added as part of the three strikes reform act. (voter information guide, text of prop. 36,  6, pp. 109-110.) among its stated purposes, as explained to voters, was to require life sentences only when a defendants current conviction is for a violent or serious crime and to ensure that repeat offenders convicted of non-violent, non-serious crimes like shoplifting and simple drug possession will receive twice the normal sentence instead of a life sentence. (id.,  1, p. 105.) in accordance with these goals, section 1170.126 permits an inmate serving an indeterminate life sentence under the previous version of the three strikes law to petition for recall of the sentence and resentencing to a term that would have been imposed under the revised law. but subdivision (e)(2) of section 1170.126 provides that an inmate is ineligible for resentencing if the current sentence was imposed for an offense described in subdivision (e)(2)(c) of section 667. ( 1170.126, subd. (e)(2); people v. hicks (2014) 231 cal.app.4th 275, 282.)2 among the offenses described in subdivision (e)(2)(c) of section 667 is any offense during the commission of which the defendant used a firearm [or] was armed with a firearm or deadly weapon. ( 667, subd. (e)(2)(c)(iii).)3 here, the trial court found, based upon victim testimony given at the preliminary hearing, that tyler had been armed with and used a firearm during the commission of his current offense. (he shot the victim.) tyler does not dispute this finding, but argues that having been armed during the commission of his offense (possession of a firearm by a felon) does not disqualify him from resentencing under proposition 36 because being armed is an element of the 2 subdivision (e)(2) of section 1170.126 provides in pertinent part that an inmate is eligible for resentencing if the inmates current sentence was not imposed for any of the offenses appearing in clauses (i) to (iii), inclusive, of subparagraph (c) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (e) of section 667 3 subdivision (e)(2)(c)(iii) of section 667 disqualifies a defendant from relief uring the commission of the current offense, the defendant used a firearm, was armed with a firearm or deadly weapon, or intended to cause great bodily injury to another person. 4 offense. therefore, he argues, the armed with a firearm exclusion applies only when being armed is tethered to another offense. the argument is without merit. where the record shows that a defendant convicted of possession of a firearm was armed with the firearm during the commission of the offense, the armed with a firearm exclusion applies and the defendant is not entitled to resentencing . . . under proposition 36. (people v. brimmer (2014) 230 cal.app.4th 782, 797; accord people v. hicks, supra, 231 cal.app.4th at pp. 283-284; people v. elder (2014) 227 cal.app.4th 1308, 1312-1314, 1317; people v. osuna (2014) 225 cal.app.4th 1020, 1030; people v. white (2014) 223 cal.app.4th 512, 525.) here, tyler was armed with and used a gun during the commission of his possession offense, which sufficed for the firearm exclusion to apply. tyler argues our interpretation of the exclusion as applied to a possession offense renders the exclusion superfluous, as all firearm possession involves being armed. the a defendant possesses a weapon when it is under his dominion and control.people v. pena (1999) 74 cal.app.4th 1078, 1083 defendant is armed if the defendant has the specified weapon available for use, either people v. bland (1995) 10 cal.4th 991, 997firearm can be under a persons dominion and control without it being available for use. for example, suppose a parolees residence (in which only he lives) is searched and a firearm is found next to his bed. the parolee is in possession of the firearm, because it is under his dominion and control. if he is not home at the time, however, he is not armed with the firearm, because it is not readily available to him for offensive or defensive use. accordingly, possessing a firearm does not necessarily constitute being armed with a firearm. (people v. osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1030.) under the circumstances in this case, tyler both possessed a firearm and had it readily available for use during his encounter with webster. the meaning of proposition 36, which renders him ineligible for resentencing. the trial court correctly denied his recall petition. 5 disposition the order dismissing tylers petition is affirmed. not to be published. chaney, j. we concur: rothschild, p. j. lui, j.
