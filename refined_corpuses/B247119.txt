[] lastly, he uses no more force than was reasonably necessary to disable the attacker. once ballard trips, head bounces off the concrete twice, he lets him go and walks away. this was confirmed even by ballard. his hair was no longer tangled in his hand. he was free to leave, and he walked away. he used 5 iii. discussion a. lesser included offense instruction defendant asserts it was prejudicial error not to instruct sua sponte on simple assault as a lesser included offense. we find no error. a trial court has a sua sponte duty to instruct on lesser included offenses whenever substantial evidence raises a question whether all the elements of the charged offense are present. (people v. smith (2013) 57 cal.4th 232, 239; people v. lewis (2001) 25 cal.4th 610, 645; people v. breverman (1998) 19 cal.4th 142, 154, 162.) in the lesser included offense context, our supreme court has held: people v. barton (1995) 12 cal.4th 186, 201, fn. 8; accord, people v. cunningham (2001) 25 cal.4th 926, 1008.) the duty does not exist, however, when the evidence is such that if the defendant is guilty at all, he is guilty of the greater offense (people v. smith, supra, 57 cal.4th at p. 240; people v. cunningham, supra, there is no people v. breverman, supra, 19 cal.4th at p. 154.) section 240 defines a simple assault, unlawful attempt, coupled with a present ability, to commit a violent injury on the person an aggravated assault includes a violation of section 240 but with a deadly weapon such as a motorcycle helmet. ( 245, subd. (a)(1).) simple assault is a lesser included offense of assault with a deadly weapon. (people v. carmen (1951) 36 cal.2d 768, 775, disapproved on another point in people v. flannel (1979) 25 cal.3d 668, 684, fn. 12; people v. mcdaniel (2008) 159 cal.app.4th 736, 747-748; people v. yeats (1977) 66 cal.app.3d 874, 879.) here, in view of the evidence introduced and the defense presented, the trial court did not have a sua sponte duty to instruct on simple assault. defendant was either the aggressor who was guilty of aggravated assault or he was not as he acted in self defense. the jury could either find defendant committed an assault with a deadly weapon or he did 6 not. the jury could not have returned a simple assault verdict. (people v. mcdaniel, supra, 159 cal.app.4th at p. 749; people v. yeats, supra, 66 cal.app.3d at pp. 879-880.) b. the abstract of judgment defendant was sentenced to three years in state prison on count 1, felony deadly weapon assault ( 245, subd. (a)(1)). also defendant received a concurrent six-month county jail term on count 2, misdemeanor vandalism ( 594, subd. (a)). defendant committed the aggravated assault prior to the october 1, 2011 effective date of the realignment legislation. (people v. montrose (2013) 220 cal.app.4th 1242, 1246; people v. wilson (2013) 220 cal.app.4th 962, 964.) the sentence is improperly recorded in the abstract of judgment as a three-year, six-month state prison sentencethree years; not three years, six months. in addition, the abstract of judgment reflects a $40 court operations assessment ( 1465.8, subd. (a)(1)) and a $30 court facilities assessment (gov. code,  70373, subd. (a)(1)). however, the trial court correctly ordered those assessments imposed as to each count. (people v. sencion (2012) 211 cal.app.4th 480, 484; see people v. alford (2007) 42 cal.4th 749, 758, fn. 6.) the abstract of judgment must be amended to reflect $80 in court operations assessments and $60 in court facilities assessments. 7 iv. disposition the judgment is affirmed. upon remittitur issuance, the clerk of the superior court is to prepare an amended abstract of judgment that reflects: a principal state prison term of three years was imposed; a concurrent county jail term of six months was imposed; $80 in court operations assessments under penal code section 1465.8, subdivision (a)(1); and $60 in court facilities assessments under government code section 70373, subdivision (a)(1). the clerk of the superior court is to deliver a copy of the amended abstract of judgment to the department of corrections and rehabilitation. not to be published in the official reports turner, p. j. we concur: mosk, j. mink, j.* * retired judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
