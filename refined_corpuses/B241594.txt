(b)).2 appellant contends that the trial court erred in imposing firearm enhancements pursuant to section 12022.5, subdivision (a), in counts 1 and 9 because use of a firearm is an element of assault with a firearm and assault with a semiautomatic firearm. he further contends that the court erred in imposing section 186.22, subdivision (b)(1)(c) gang enhancements on counts 1 and 9 because there was no underlying violent felony. we disagree with the contentions and affirm the judgment. factual and procedural background on october 12, 2008, around 10:25 a.m., raymond luquin walked out of his home in the city of los angeles and saw a car pull up and stop on the other side of the street. appellant was driving the car. appellant pointed a gun at luquin and asked if he was from kam, a gang. luquin replied that he was not 1 jury. 2 all further statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise specified. 3 reference to another gang. appellant then drove away. wn a passing police car and reported the incident. officers saw appellant, called for backup, and began following him. appellant led officers on a long pursuit on the freeway and city streets until he ran a red light and crashed into three cars, injuring several people. appellant climbed out the car window, ran away, and fought with officers, but the officers subdued him and took him into custody. luquin identified appellant in a field showup. officers discovered about $700 and plastic baggies of metaltercation. officers also discovered a handgun and ammunition in his car. a gang expert testified about the kam and east l.a. trece gangs and field identification cards and tattoos, that he was pointing of the gun and his possession of methamphetamine were committed for the benefit of the gang. appellant was charged with nine counts: (1) assault with a firearm ( 245, subd.

(a)(1)), and as to counts 4 and 5, it was alleged that appellant was armed with a firearm ( 12022, subd. (c)). the information also alleged that suares personally used a handgun in the commission of all offenses. ( 12022.5.) the information contained gang allegations under section 186.22, subdivision (b)(1)(c) as to counts 1 and 9, and gang allegations under section 186.22, subdivision (b)(1)(a) as to counts 2 through 7. the jury convicted appellant on all counts, except count 5, and found the allegations to be true. the court sentenced appellant to a total term of 37 years 4 months, calculated as follows. as to count 9 (assault with a semiautomatic firearm), the principal term, the court imposed the midterm of six years, doubled pursuant to three strikes, plus a four-year term for the firearm enhancement ( 12022.5, subd.

(b)(1)(a).) the court imposed a concurrent six-month term on count 8. the court imposed a consecutive term of five years pursuant to section 667, subdivision (a)(1), and it imposed and stayed a one-year term pursuant to section 667.5, subdivision (b). appellant filed a timely notice of appeal. discussion appellant challenges his sentence on two grounds, neither of which we find meritorious. i. section 12022.5 enhancements appellant contends that the trial court erred in imposing section 12022.5, subdivision (a) firearm enhancements on counts 1 and 9 because the use of a firearm is an element of the offenses of assault with a firearm and assault with a semiautomprovided in subdivision (b), any person who personally uses a firearm in the commission of a felony or attempted felony shall be punished by an additional and consecutive term of imprisonment in the state prison for 3, 4, or 10 years, unless being an element of the offense, the additional term provided by this section shall 6 appellant was convicted of violating section 245, subdivision (a)(2), assault with a firearm, in count 1, and section 245, subdivision (b), assault with a semiautomatic firearm, in count 9. thus, pursuant to section 12022.5, subdivision (d), the firearm enhancements were properly imposed on both counts. appellant relies on people v. sinclair (2008) 166 cal.app.4th 848 (sinclair), in which we addressed the application of a one-year armed principal enhancement under section 12022, subdivision (a)(1) to a section 245 conviction for assault with a firearm. section 12022 provides for a one-year enhancement for ( 12022, subd. (a)(1).) however, unlike section 12022.5, section 12022 does not contain an exception for a violation of section 245. sinclair therefore is inapplicable. ii. section 186.22 enhancements second contention is that the trial court erred in imposing 10-year gang enhancements on counts 1 and 9 pursuant to section 186.22, subdivision of section 186.22 authorizes a five-year enhancement when the underlying offense subdivision (b)(1)(c) of section 186.22 authorizes a 10-year enhancement when (sinclair, supra, 166 cal.app.4th at p. 856.) assault with a firearm is not listed as a violent felony in section 667.5, 7 which the defendant uses a firearm which use had been charged and proved as ( 667.5, subd. (c)(8).) -year gang enhancement should not have been imposed is based on his argument that section 12022.5 was not applicable to counts 1 and 9. he again relies on sinclair, in which we held that the court was required to impose only the five-year gang enhancement of section 186.22, subdivision (b)(1)(b) rather than the 10-year enhancement in subdivision (b)(1)(c). (sinclair, supra, 166 cal.app.4th at p. 856.) as discussed above, sinclair is distinguishable because the firearm allegation in that case was for a person armed with a firearm under section 12022, not the firearm allegation for personal use of a firearm under section 12022.5. section 667.5, subdivision (c)(8) specifically includes in its purview a felony in which firearm use has been charged and proved as provided in section 12022.5. ( 667.5, subd. (c)(8).) here, the allegation that appellant personally used a firearm pursuant to section 12022.5 was charged and found true. we therefore -year gang enhancements under section 186.22, subdivision (b)(1)(c). 8 disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports willhite, j. we concur: epstein, p. j. suzukawa, j.
