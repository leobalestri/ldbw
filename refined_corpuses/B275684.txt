filed 3/8/18 p. v. murillo ca2/2 not to be published in the official reports california rules of court, rule 8.1115(a), prohibits courts and parties from citing or relying on opinions not certified for publication or ordered published, except as specified by rule 8.1115(b). this opinion has not been certified for publication or ordered published for purposes of rule 8.1115. in the court of appeal of the state of california second appellate district division two the people, plaintiff and respondent, v. maximiliano murillo et al., defendants and appellants. b275684 (los angeles county super. ct. no. ta134222) appeal from a judgment of the superior court of los angeles county. eleanor j. hunter, judge. affirmed as modified. david l. annicchiarico, under appointment by the court of appeal, for defendant and appellant maximiliano murillo. kathy r. moreno, under appointment by the court of appeal, for defendant and appellant jose antonio valdes. janyce keiko imata blair, under appointment by the court of appeal, for defendant and appellant ricardo virgen. 2 xavier becerra, attorney general, gerald a. engler, chief assistant attorney general, lance e. winters, senior assistant attorney general, paul m. roadarmel, jr., supervising deputy attorney general, and william n. frank, deputy attorney general, for plaintiff and respondent. * * * * * * three gang members drove into rival gang territory in a caravan and gunned down a rival gang member who was walking down the street. after a joint trial, a jury convicted each of them of varying degrees of murder and found that the crime was gang expert impermissibly offered an opinion on their guilt; that the trial court erred in not instructing the jury that two of the three defendants incriminating statements to jailhouse informants needed to be corroborated; that the trial court misinstructed on the gang enhancement; that the trial court erred in imposing sentence on the gang enhancement; and that they are entitled to a remand for the trial court to consider whether to strike the 25-year firearm enhancement in light of the newly enacted senate bill (sb) 620. only defendants last two arguments have merit. accordingly, we affirm their convictions and remand for resentencing. facts and procedural background i. facts maximiliano murillo (murillo), jose antonio valdes (valdes), and ricardo virgen (virgen) (collectively, defendants) are members of the village boys gang. in late april 2012, valdes and virgen beat up a fellow village boys gang member, michael . the next day, soto saw valdes and relayed that members of the village bloods, a rival gang, had just beat up soto and his girlfriend. incensed 3 that someone else would beat up soto, valdes got into his white van and drove off. minutes later, all three defendants drove to village bloods gang territory in a caravan of vehiclesvirgen in a gray car and valdes and murillo in a white van. surveillance , and the gps anklet murillo was wearing (because he was on parole) confirm movements. defendants came upon raymond fuzee (fuzee), a village bloods gang member. they fired 10 bullets at fuzee from two different firearmsa .357 handgun and a ruger mini-14. fuzee died from his wounds. the day after the shooting, valdes told sotoe killed a slang for a village bloods member. the next month, village boys gang members sold the .357 handgun and the ruger mini-14 used to kill fuzee to undercover police officers. in july 2014, murillo had a secretly recorded conversation with a fellow inmate. to the inmate, murillo acknowledged that was ng a white van murillo also said that there were two others with him, o valdes is younger than murillo, and virgen is older. in february 2015, virgen had a secretly recorded ods territory at who were in a vehicle behind his, which was a van; ty ; and that he . virgen also explained that 4 ii. procedural background the people charged all three defendants with a single count of murder (pen. code,  187).1 the people further alleged that the murder was committed for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with a criminal street gang ( 186.22, subd. (b)(1)(c)); that a principal in the crime discharged a firearm ( 12022.53, subds. (d) & (e)(1)); and that virgen and valdes personally discharged a firearm ( 12022.53, subd. (d)). the people further alleged that murillo had served four prior prison terms ( 667.5, subd. (b)). the matter proceeded to a joint trial for all three defendants. a jury convicted virgen of first degree murder, and found valdes and murillo guilty of second degree murder. as to all three defendants, the jury found the gang allegation and the allegation to be true. the jury found that virgen personally discharged a firearm, but that valdes did not. the trial court sentenced all three defendants to prison. the court sentenced virgen to 50 years to life, comprised of 25 years to life for first degree murder plus 25 years to life for his personal use of a firearm. the court sentenced valdes and murillo to 40 years to life, comprised of 15 years to life for second degree murder plus 25 years to life for a firearm. as to all three defendants, the court imposed and stayed 10-year sentences for the gang enhancement. all three defendants filed timely notices of appeal. 1 all further statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise indicated. 5 discussion i. convictions a. impermissibly offered an opinion on whether they were guilty of rulings for an abuse of discretion (people v. clark (2016) 63 cal.4th 522, 597), and whether those rulings violate any constitutional guarantees de novo (people ex rel. reisig v. acuna (2017) 9 cal.app.5th 1, 22-23). 1. pertinent facts each of the defendants was a member of the village boys gang. with regard to murillo, the expert offered four reasons for his consistent with that gang. [3] n openly associating with members of that gang. [4] for today, murder of a rival gang member (italics added.) with regard to valdes, the expert offered five [field identification] cards, [2] openly associating with other members of the gang, [3] the tattoos on his body, [4] hanging out in the area, and [5] here today, going into the rival gang neighborhood and committing murder (italics added.) with regard to virgen, the expert offered a with other members of the gang, [2] having tattoos consistent with that gang, [3] hanging out in that gang area, and [4] again, with other members of his own gang (italics added.) none of testimony. 6 2. analysis an expert witness may offer an opinion if it is: (1) experience that the opinion of [the] expert would assist the trier nd (2) [b]ased on matter . . . that is of a type that reasonably may be relied upon by an expert in forming an opinion upon the subject. vidence of gang people v. gonzalez (2005) 126 cal.app.4th 1539, 1550), experts may permissibly offer opinions on a variety of topics related to gangs, committed to benefit or promote a people v. killebrew (2002) 103 cal.app.4th 644, 657, disapproved in part on other grounds by people v. vang (2011) 52 cal.4th 1038, 1045.) moreover, when offering these opinions, experts may rely upon the circumstances of the charged crime: in people v. castenada (2000) 23 cal.4th 743, 752-753 (castenada) and vang, respectively, our supreme court held that gang experts may cite to the facts of the charged crimes to offer opinions on whether the defendant was actively participating in a criminal street gang and on whether the charged crime benefitted a gang. within these parameters. the expert was explaining the basis for his opinion that each of the defendants was a member of the village boys, and one of those reasons was that they were engaged in behavior that only a member of a gang would undertakenamely, driving with fellow gang members into a rime to prove each 7 testimony of the expert in castenada who relied on the facts of the charged crime to prove the the gang. (castenada, supra, 23 cal.4th at pp. 752-753.) both are permissible. language could be read as offering an opinion that each defendant was guilty of the charged murder. witness may not express an opinion on a of no assistancejury, who is just as able as any expert to make that determination. (people v. coffman and marlow (2004) 34 cal.4th 1, 77; people v. leonard (2014) 228 cal.app.4th 465, 493; people v. torres (1995) 33 cal.app.4th 37, 47.) however, the gang expert in this case did not offer any opinion on reasons supporting his opinion that defendants are gang and does so by ripping the italicized language out of context. not only does this argument ignore the maxim that we must view the record in context (see, e.g., people v. hawthorne (1992) 4 cal.4th 43, 60-61; people v. bozigian (1969) 270 cal.app.2d 373, 376-377), but it also ignores that no one at the timeincluding the three defense attorneys and the trial courtunderstood the seems highly 8 interpretation as passing judgment on the ultimate question of guilt.2 b. failure to instruct that accomplice testimony requires corroboration defendants assert that the trial court erred in not find some corroboration of those statements. we independently instructions. (people v. posey (2004) 32 cal.4th 193, 218 (posey).) a trial court has a sua sponte duty to instruct a jury that testimony able to prosecution for the identical other evidence as shall tend to connect the defendant with the -court testimony -of-court statements . . . used as substantive evidence of guilt which are made under suspect people v. williams (1997) 16 cal.4th 153, 245, quoting people v. jeffery (1995) 37 cal.app.4th 209, 218; cf. people v. guiuan (1998) 18 cal.4th 558, 567 [corroboration not required when accomplice testifies for the defense].) corroboration is required in the above specified circumstances 2 in light of this conclusion, we have no occasion to reach the ineffective for not objecting or that any error was harmful. (see, e.g., people v. weaver 9 because those circumstances are the ones where the accomplice otive . . . williams, at p. 246; people v. brown (2003) 31 cal.4th 518, 555 (brown).) in brown, supra, 31 cal.4th 518, our supreme court held that an out-of-court statement that qualifies as a declaration id. at pp. 555-556, italics omitted.) to qualify as a declaration against penal interest, the people must prove: the declarant is unavailablethe declaration was against the declapenal interestthe declaration was sufficiently reliable to warrant admission despite its hearsay character.people v. lucas (1995) 12 cal.4th 415, 462; people v. duarte (2000) 24 cal.4th 603, 610-611 (duarte); evid. code,  1230.) the jailhouse statements of murillo and virgen were not corroboration) because their statements are declarations against penal interest. the trial court so ruled, and we independently agree with its reasoning. both murillo and virgen were unavailable as witnesses due to their invocation of their privilege against self-incrimination. their statements were also against each penal interest and sufficiently reliable: murillo admitted that he was driving the white van in the caravan that traveled into village bloods territory at the time fuzee was specifically disserving to them. (duarte, supra, 24 cal.4th at pp. 611-612.) 10 because he ascribed to himself a minimal role (as driver, not was minimal. indeed, the fact that he did not falsely inflate his role makes his statement more trustworthy, not less. defendants also assert to him statement were following him in the caravan is incriminating to him because it shows the crime was committed en masse with his fellow gang members, which supports the gang enhancement.3 c. cumulative error murillo argues that his murder conviction is invalid due to the cumulative effect of both of the above discussed errors. because his individual claims lack merit, there is no error to cumulate. (people v. mcwhorter (2009) 47 cal.4th 318, 377.) ii. sentencing a. instructional error underlying gang enhancement defendants argue that the trial court erred in instructing 3 although defendants only obliquely mention it on appeal, statements were confrontation cstatements made unwittingly to a davis v. washington (2006) 547 u.s. 813, 825; people v. hajek and vo (2014) 58 cal.4th 1144, 1214; people v. arauz (2012) 210 cal.app.4th 1394, 1402.) 11 cerrors de novo. (posey, supra, 32 cal.4th at p. 218.) a defendant may be subject to sentencing enhancements if direction of, or in association with ( collectively engage in, or have engaged in, a pattern of criminal within three years of each other. ( 186.22, subd. (e).) as the people concede, the trial court in this case committed instructional error when it instructed the jury that [of] possession of [an] assault weapon murder is a statutorily enumerated predicate offense ( 186.22, subd. (e)(3)), but possession of an assault weapon is not (people v. fiu (2008) 165 cal.app.4th 360, 387). however, this instructional error is harmless beyond a find the defendant guilty of a crime in this case, you may consider that crime in deciding . . . whether a pattern of criminal gang activ this instruction is proper. (people v. bragg charged offense or offenses . . . may be considered in determining a pattern of criminal street murder by village boys gang member victor garabay in 2012, 12 murder in 2016offenses, and the instructional error is harmless. defendants assert that it violates due process to uphold the gang enhancement based upon the murder charged in this case. for support, they cite people v. mancebo (2002) 27 cal.4th 735 and cole v. arkansas (1948) 333 u.s. 196.4 there is no due process violation. the law allows the people to rely upon the charged offense in proving a pattern of criminal street gang activity, and the jury was so instructed; this provided defendants ample notice and opportunity to be heardthe hallmarks of due process. mancebo dealt with our one strike law, which requires its statutory provisions for enhancements to be pled and proven (mancebo, at p. 749); the gang enhancement statute does not require the specific predicate offenses to be pled, and the charged murder was proven beyond a reasonable doubt. and cole held that an appellate court could not uphold a sentence on the basis of a crime that was never charged or proven. (cole, at pp. 201-202.) wactually presented to the jury. b. sentencing errors 1. imposition of stayed sentence for gang enhancement for valdes and murillo valdes and murillo assert that the trial court erred in imposing and staying a 10-year prison sentence for the gang enhancement. they are right. where, as here, a defendant is subject to the enhancement for a principal use of a firearm in the midst of a gang crime (rather than personal use), a court may 4 defendants also cite turner v. united states (1970) 396 u.s. 398 and people v. salas (2001) 89 cal.app.4th 1275, but those cases are irrelevant to this issue. 13 not impose both the firearm enhancement and the gang enhancement. (people v. brookfield (2009) 47 cal.4th 583, 590.) 2. imposition of stayed sentence for gang enhancement for virgen virgen argues that the trial court erred in imposing and staying a 10-year prison sentence for the gang enhancement. he is also right. where, as here, a defendant is convicted of felony punishable by imprisonment enhancement provides for a 15-year parole minimum, not an additional 10-year sentence. ( 186.22, subd. (b)(5); accord, people v. lopez (2005) 34 cal.4th 1002, 1007.) c. remand for sb 620 hearing defendants have asked for a remand for the trial court to consider whether to strike the 25-year-to-life enhancement it imposed. sb 620 amended section 12022.53 to grant trial courts the discretion to strike its firear  12022.53, subd. (h), as amended by stats. 2017, ch. 682,  2.) although the effective date of this amendment is january 1, 2018, it applies retroactively to any defendant whose conviction is not yet final because it mitigates punishment by granting a trial court the discretion to strike the previously mandatory firearm enhancement. (in re estrada (1965) 63 cal.2d 740, 748-750; people v. francis (1969) 71 cal.2d 66, 75-76.) disposition the case is remanded for resentencing to allow the trial court to consider whether the enhancements under sections 12022.53 should be stricken pursuant to section 1385. the judgments are modified as follows: as to murillo, the portion of the judgment imposing and staying a 10-year enhancement pursuant to section 186.22, 14 subdivision (b)(1)(c) is stricken, and the trial court is ordered to prepare and forward to californias department of corrections and rehabilitation an abstract of judgment modified accordingly. as to valdes, the portion of the judgment imposing and staying a 10-year enhancement pursuant to section 186.22, subdivision (b)(1)(c) is also stricken, and the trial court is ordered to prepare and forward to s department of corrections and rehabilitation an abstract of judgment modified accordingly. as to virgen, the portion of the judgment imposing and staying a 10-year enhancement pursuant to section 186.22, subdivision (b)(1)(c) is stricken, and replaced with the 15-year minimum term for parole eligibility required by section 186.22, subdivision (b)(5). the trial court is ordered to prepare and forward to californias department of corrections and rehabilitation an abstract of judgment modified accordingly. in all other respects, the judgments are affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. ______________________, j. hoffstadt we concur: _________________________, acting p. j. ashmann-gerst _________________________, j. chavez
