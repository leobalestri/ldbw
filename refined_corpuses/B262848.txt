(people v. jones (nov. 24, 2014, b251324, b266936) [nonpub opn.].) w that calabria rendered ineffective assistance by about interviews with the victims regarding the date of the crimes. on april 25, 2014, we had also decided harris v. superior court (2014) 225 cal.app.4th 1129 (harris). we held that harris was denied effective assistance of counsel at his preliminary hearing, because his counsel had himself been arrested and was facing pending felony charges by the same prosecuting entity (the los angeles id. at p. 1132.) the deputy who arrested harris testified at the preliminary hearing. 3 this created an actual conflict of interest between harris and his attorney. (id. at pp. 1135, 1141.) harris moved to set aside the information and the trial court denied the motion. (id. at p. 1132.) we reversed, holding that the actual conflict of interest at the preliminary hearing required dismissal of the information without an affirmative showing of prejudice, as harris raised the issue in the trial court before he was tried or convicted. (id. at pp. 11451146.) required for postconviction id. at p. 1147; see people v. anderson (2015) 234 cal.app.4th 1411, 14201421.) on january 15, 2015, the prosecutor informed appellate counsel in the first appeal that calabria was being prosecuted by the los angeles counoffice while he represented jones (neither calabria nor the public defender who represented jones at sentencing had told appellate counsel about the conflict, and there was nothing in the trial file). jones filed this habeas petition on march 23, 2015, arguing that under harris, supra, 225 cal.app.4th 1129 assistance of counsel, and we should presume prejudicecame to light only after her trial and conviction. we have reviewed the briefing although our supreme court has applied a presumption of prejudice where a conflict arose from an attorneyhave never eliminated our general requirement that a defendant demonstrate outcome-determinative prejudice from a violation of his state constitutional right to conflict-free (people v. doolin (2009) 45 cal.4th 390, 420.) claim of conflicted representation is one variety of claim that counsel provided ineffective assistance. hence, to obtain reversal of a criminal verdict, the defendant must demonstrate that (1) counsel labored under an actual conflict of interest that adversely (people v. mai (2013) 57 cal.4th 986, 10091010.) jones must show prejudice. 4 we have already held that no prejudice appears here. in our opinion first appeal and habeas petition, we concluded that a different outcome was not reasonably probable if calabria had conducted his examination of the investigator differently. the jury that the prosecutor interviewed the victims about two months before trial and asked them whether they were sure the crimes occurred on april 28, then sometime later, perhaps just a few weeks before trial, the victims realized that april 28 was the wrong date and informed the prosecutor the crimes really occurred on april 27. that the victims adhered to the april 28 date during their interviews by the prosecutor was implicit in light of this testimony. accordingly, it is not reasonably probable [jones] would have december 2012 interview.(italics added.) we will not presume outcome-determinative prejudice, and jones has failed to show that prejudice resulted in the absence of a showing of prejudice, she is not entitled to relief. disposition the petition for habeas corpus is denied. not to be published. johnson, j. we concur: chaney, acting p. j. lui, j.
