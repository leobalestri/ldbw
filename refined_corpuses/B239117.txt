(a)) committed for the benefit of a criminal street gang ( 186.22, subd. (b)(1)(c)). the jury found each defendant personally inflicted great bodily injury ( 12022.7, subd. (a)). defendants each were sentenced to life in state prison plus a consecutive 3-affirm the judgments in all other respects. ii. the evidence a. the prosecution case on june 9, 2010, an individual assaulted gilbert lopez, an el monte flores gang member. the assault occurred in an area controlled by the gang. jonathan temores, an associate of the gang, was with mr. lopez at the time. jonathan2 did not come to mr. assault. mr. lopez was assaulted, in the evening of that day, he received several telephone calls on a cellular telephone he shared with jonathan. first, a male voice asked for jonathan. second, a sr. heard only laughing. the fourth time, a male voice asked for jonathan and told jose 1 all further statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise noted. 2 to avoid confusion, we refer to members of the temores family by their first names. 3 answering the telephone. on the following day, jose sr. received two more calls asking for jonathan. the voices on each of the calls were different. in the days following the assault on mr. lopez, jose sr. also received several text messages on the cellular telephone he shared with jonathan. one message, in spanish, on june 10, 2010, defendants, who were also el monte flores gang members, temores jr. (jose), said that jonathan was not home. defendants assaulted jose. when assaulted felix. jose testified at trial that when he opened the door, he recognized mr. davila. mr. davila was wearing a black or gray and white striped shirt and a black hat with a fish and not recognize the two men who were with mr. davila. the second male was standing approximately seven or eight feet away. a third male stood 15 to 17 feet away. mr. davila swung at jose with a closed fist. when jose swung back, mr. davila and the second male assaulted him with their fists. jose estimated he was hit more than 10 times in the chest and head. he threw punches and kicked at his assailants in an effort to defend himself. later, at the hospital, jose identified mr. davila in a photographic lineup. jose also identified mr. gutierrez as one of the assailants. he told detectives ralph batres and eduardo nafarrate he was not 100 percent sure about it. felix heard a commotion and went to help jose. he saw three males punching jose. felix joined the fight to help his nephew. felix subsequently identified mr. suarez in a photographic lineup. when she first heard the knock alooked out and saw several hispanic males in their twenties. ms. gonzalez was not able 4 to identify any of the attackers. at trial however, she described the person who knocked at the door as wearing a blac girlfriend. she had seen mr. davila many times prior to the night of the assault. ms. puentes testified mr. davila drove a blue astro van. ms. puentes further testified she name. she had seen him around the neighborhood. at trial, she identified mr. gutierrez as that second man. she had previously identified mr. gutierrez in a photographic lineup. also at trial, ms. puentes identified mr. suarez as the third assailant. she knew his girlfriend monica. she had seen mr. suarez around the neighborhood and knew him tattooed on his wrist. as the fight broke out, ms. puentes took the children who were in the home into a bedroom to keep them safe. when she returned, she saw jose and felix fighting with mr. davila and mr. gutierrez punching jose. mr. suarez was punching felix. the fight lasted only a few minutes. jose and felix crawled back into the apartment as defendants were trying to push the door open. family members struggled to close the door. jose and felix sustained multiple stab wounds. jose was stabbed in the left cheek and left shoulder. he was stabbed three times in the left side of his chest below his armpit. the shoulder wound required 16 stitches. jose was hospitalized for five days. felix was stabbed in his right hand, the right side of his torso, and his left chest. he lost a large amount of blood. the wound to his hand required 15 stitches. the wound to his torso required 10 stitches and 10 staples. jose and ms. puentes both testified they never saw any weapons. jose was interviewed by law enforcement officers while hospitalized. jose told detective batres it was mr. davila who stabbed him. he identified mr. gutierrez from a 5 photographic line-up. jose said mr. gutierrez was the third male, the one who initially stood furthest from him. jose thought mr. gutierrez had fought with felix, but he was not 100 percent certain. while still hospitalized, jose told ms. puentes he was sure that mr. gutierrez was one of the assailants. felix, who was also hospitalized, identified mr. suarez from a photographic lineup. on june 13, 2010, three days after the assault, detective batres and a partner searched a mobile home where mr. davila lived. mr. davila was not home, but mr. gutierrez was lying down in a bedroom in the home. detective batres did not recall seeing avan on the property. as noted above, ms. puentes had told law enforcement officers that mr. davila drove a blue van. detective batres, an experienced gang investigator, testified as a gang expert. he explained as follows. gang members earn the respect of other gang members by being that is, disciplined, by the gang. it is important to a gang to discipline its members in intimidate others. gang members who participate in regulating one of their own gain individual status. the primary activities of the el monte flores gang were robbery, assault, witness intimidation, drug sales and murder. el monte flores gang members them. in response to a hypothetical question tracking the facts of this case, officer batres to defend their fellow gang member, mr. lopez. defendants assaulted jose and felix because they were in the way; because violence and intimidation benefit the gang. b. the defense case ms. puentes at the scene of the assault. ms. puentes said she recognized mr. davila as 6 one of the assailants. she described the second attacker as a hispanic male, around 19 gray shirt and had a mustache. she was unable to describe the third suspect. was included in the lineup. but the man felix identified was not one of the three defendants. detective nafarratte also testified jose sr. never contacted him about the telephone calls and text messages. detective nafarratte learned about them after meeting jose sr. by chance. detective nafarratte asked jose sr. for the telephone number associated with the calls and texts. jose sr. said his wife had deleted the information. tiffany ortiz, testified mr. davila was with her all day and evening, until 11 p.m., on the from 3:45 p.m. through the night in question until the next morning. ez and mr. because felix suffered stab wounds, mr. suarez must have been armed with a knife. the trial court struck the personal weapon use enhancement allegations ( 12022, subd. (b)(1)) as to mr. davila and mr. gutierrez. the court also struck the great bodily injury enhancement allegations ( 12022.7, subd. (a)) against mr. davila and mr. gutierrez as to felix and against mr. suarez as to jose. the jury found: mr. davila and mr. gutierrez personally inflicted great bodily injury on jose; and mr. suarez personally inflicted great bodily injury on felix. the jury found the personal weapon use enhancement allegation ( 12022, subd. (b)(1)) as to mr. suarez to be not true. 7 iii. discussion a. substantial evidence supported the attempted murder convictions defendants challenge the sufficiency of the evidence to support their attempted willful, deliberate and premeditated murder convictions. we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution and presume in support of the judgment every fact the jury could reasonably deduce from the evidence. (people v. medina (2009) 46 cal.4th 913, 919; people v. hatch (2000) 22 cal.4th 260, 272.) we find substantial commit the act constituting the offense, or aid and abet in its commission, . . . are citations.] thus, a person who aids and abets a crime is guilty of that crime even if someone else committed some or all of the criminal vicarious. rather, town acts and own liability for criminal conduct is of two kinds. first, an aider and abettor with the necessary mental state is guilty of the intended crime. second, under the natural and probable consequences doctrine, an aider and abettor is guilty not only of the intended f only an intended assault, but a murder results, that person may be guilty of that murder, even if unintended, if it is a natural and probable consequence of the intended assault. people v. mccoy (2001) 25 cal.4th 1111, 1116-1117.) often blurred. it is often an oversimplification to describe one person as the actual perpetrator and the other as the aider and abettor. when two or more persons commit a crime together, both may act in part as the actual perpetrator and in part as the aider and 8 abettor of the other, who also acts in part as an actual perpetrator. guilt for attempted murder might be based entirely on his own actions . . . . [i]n a stabbing case, one person might restrain the victim while the other does the stabbing. . . . [b]oth participants would be direct perpetrators as well as aiders and abettors of the other. the aider and abettor doctrine merely makes aiders and abettors liable for their the aider and abettor and who the direct perpetrator or to what extent each played which people v. mccoy, supra, 25 cal.4th at p. 1120.) direct but ineffectual act toward accomplishing the intended killing. [citations.] to be under the natural-and-probable-consequences doctrine [citations], . . . the person must perpetrator and with an intent or purpose either of committing, or of encouraging or ion. [citations.] when the crime at issue requires a specific intent, in order to be guilty as an aider and abettor the person and abettor, a person must give aid or encouragement with knowledge of the direct accomplishment of the intended killingwhich means that the person guilty of attempted murder as an apeople v. lee (2003) 31 cal.4th 613, 623-624.) an attempted murderer need not personally have acted with willfulness, deliberation, and premeditation to be guilty as an aider and abettor. (people v. lee, supra, 31 cal.4th at pp. 621-628.) 9 the intended crime [target offense] but also of any other crime the perpetrator actually commits [nontarget offense] that is a natural and probable consequence of the intended crime. the latter question is not whether the aider and abettor actually foresaw the additional crime, but whether, judged objectively, it was reasonably foreseeable. natural and probable consequences doctrine should have known that the charged offense was a reasonably foreseeable consequence of consequence is a factual issue to be resolved by the jury who evaluate all the factual people v. favor (2012) 54 cal.4th 868, 874.) under the natural and probable consequences doctrine as applied to attempted willful, deliberate, premeditated murder, the jury must find the attempted murder was a natural and probable consequences of the target crime, here assault. (people v. favor, supra, 54 cal.4th at p. 872.) the jury need not find that premeditation was a natural and probable consequence of the target offense. (ibid. does not decide the truth of the penalty premeditation allegation until it first has reached a verdict on the substantive offense of attempted murder. [citation.] thus, with respect to the natural and probable consequences doctrine as applied to the premeditation allegation under section 664(a), attempted murdernot attempted premeditated murderqualifies as the nontarget offense to which the jury must find foreseeability. accordingly, once the jury finds that an aider and abettor, in general or under the natural and probable consequences doctrine, has committed an attempted murder, it separately determines whether the attempted murder was willful, deliberate, and premeditated. [] under the natural and probable consequences doctrine, there is no requirement that an aider and 10 abettor reasonably foresee an attempted premeditated murder as the natural and probable consequence of the target offense. it is sufficient that attempted murder is a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the crime aided and abetted, and the attempted murder itself was committed willfully, deliberately and with prempeople v. favor, supra, 54 cal.4th at pp. 879-880.) based on the evidence before it, the jury could reasonably conclude as follows. the three defendants assaulted the two victims. each aided and abetted the others by his acts. defendants arrived together at the temores home. defendants intended to assault jose and felix after they answered the door and jose told defendants that jonathan was not at home. defendants wanted to send a message that the gang would not tolerate behavior such as reputations within the gang. defendants each were direct perpetrators and aided and abetted each other in the fist fight in which they all engaged. at least one of the defendants was armed with a knife. there was substantial is well settled that intent to kill or express malice, the mental state required to convict a people v. avila (2009) 46 cal.4th 680, 702, citing people v. smith (2005) 37 cal.4th 733, 741.) both victims were unarmed and suffered multiple stab wounds in vital body parts during unprovoked attacks. this was substantial evidence the assailant or assailants had a specific intent to kill. (people v. avila, supra, 46 cal.4th at pp. 701-702; people v. bolden (2002) 29 cal.4th 515, 561; people v. osband (1996) 13 cal.4th 622, 682.) there also was substantial evidence the direct perpetrator or perpetrators of the attempted murders acted willfully, deliberately and with premeditation. our supreme court has identified three basic categories of evidence found sufficient to sustain a finding of premeditation and deliberation: (1) planning activity; (2) motive; and (3) manner of killing or attempted killing. (people v. gonzalez (2012) 54 cal.4th 643, 663; 11 people v. anderson (1968) 70 cal.2d 15, 26-anderson guidelines are nor are they exclusive in describing the evidence that will support a finding of people v. gonzalez, supra, 54 cal.4th at p. 663.) here, when defendants arrived at the temores home, at least one of them was armed with a knife. the jury could reasonably infer the direct perpetrator or perpetrators had considered the possibility of a violent encounter from the outset. (people v. lee (2011) 51 cal.4th 620, 636; people v. elliot (2005) 37 cal.4th 453, 471; people v. steele (2002) 27 cal.4th 1230, 1250.) defenthat had occurred a day earlier, giving them time to reflect on their actions. they assaulted jose when he answered the door and denied that jonathan was present. they aid. defendants resorted to violence to send a message and advance their reputation in the community. they stabbed the unarmed victims multiple times in vital body parts. the victims suffered significant loss of blood and required extensive sutures. this was substantial evidence of premeditation and deliberation. (see people v. elliot, supra, 37 cal.4th at p. 471; people v. hughes (2002) 27 cal.4th 287, 371.) moreover, judged objectively, it was reasonably foreseeable a gang motivated assault would eaids and abets criminal conduct is guilty of not only the intended crime [target offense] but also of any other crime the perpetrator actually commits [nontarget offense] that is a natural and probable consequence of the intended crime. the latter question is not whether the aider and abettor actually foresaw the additional crime, but whether, judged objectively, it was reasonably the (people v. medina, supra, 12 people v. medina, supra, 46 cal.4th at p. 921, citing people v. montes (1999) 74 cal.app.4th 1050, 1056, people v. godinez (1992) 2 cal.app.4th 492, 501, fn. 5; people v. montano (1979) 96 cal.app.3d 221, 227, superseded by statute on another point as stated in people v. gibbs (1983) 145 cal.app.3d 794, 797; accord, people v. ayala (2010) 181 cal.app.4th 1440, 1451.) . . the ultimate factual question is one of foreseeability. [citpossible consequence which might reasonably have been all the factual circumstances of the individual case [citation] and is a factual issue to be people v. medina, supra, 46 cal.4th at p. 920.) here, defendants, members of a violent street gang, knowingly and intentionally participated in a planned, gang motivated assault that resulted in great bodily injury to two victims. the gang used violence to enhance its reputation and that of its members, murder. the jury could reasonably conclude the fact that a fellow gang member would be armed with a knife was reasonably foreseeable. the assault was motivated by a desire generally. defendants arrived unannounced at the temores residence dressed in gang attire. they assaulted the unarmed victims. the attack continued as the victims attempted to retreat into the apartment. given these facts, the jury could reasonably escalation of the confrontation from a fistfight to assault with a knife was reasonably foreseeable. (see people v. medina, supra, 46 cal.4th at pp. 919-928; people v. ayala, supra, 181 cal.app.4th at pp. 1447-1453; people v. gonzales (2001) 87 cal.app.4th 1, 7-11; people v. montes, supra, 74 cal.app.4th at pp. 1054-1056; people v. olguin (1994) 13 31 cal.app.4th 1355, 1376; people v. godinez, supra, 2 cal.app.4th at pp. 499-500; people v. montano, supra, 96 cal.app.3d at p. 227.) b. there was no error or abuse of discretion in admitting jose cellular telephone calls and texts as noted above, jose sr. testified that in the days following the assault on mr. lopez, he received several telephone calls and text messages on a cellular telephone he shared with his son jonathan. one text included a photograph of mr. lopez in a hospital and text messages, court. there was no evidence as to the source of the calls or the texts. there was no evidence connecting any of the three defendants with the calls or the texts. about to hear testimony from jose temores senior. this testimony and any exhibits admitted during mr. temores testimony may be considered only for the following purposes: to explain the absence of jonathan temores at this trial; as a basis for any expert opinion that may be rendered later in this trial by a police gang expert, and there is also going to be an exhibit admitted, an e-mail or text message which contains some language, that may be considered only for the purpose of explaining the belief of the sender of the e-mail whoever you may determine that sender to be. [] that e-mail, as well, may be considered as a basis for the expert opinion and also to explain the absence of jonathan temores. [] so the testimony of mr. temores senior, as well as any exhibit admitted, including this e-again, to explain the absence of jonathan temores; as a basis for any expert opinion rendered by a police gang expert subsequent in this trial, and to explain the belief of the sender of the e-mail or the test message, whoever you may determine that sender to be. you may consider it only for those purposes and you may give it whatever weight you 14 feel it deserves based upon all the evidence in this case and the instructions that i give -mail or text message is not offered for the truth of the matter asserted, only for the belief of the sender, whoever defendants contend the evidence should have been excluded as more prejudicial than probative under evidence code section 352. our review is for an abuse of discretion. (people v. eubanks (2011) 53 cal.4th 110, 144-145; people v. jablonski (2006) 37 cal.4th 774, 805.) we find no abuse of discretion. where such evidence is relevant to an issue of motive or intentmotive is ordinarily the incentive for criminal behavior, its probative value generally exceeds prejudicial effect, and wide latitude is permitted in admitting evidence of its people v. gonzalez (2005) 126 cal.app.4th 1539, 1550; accord, people v. mckinnon (2011) 52 cal.4th 610, 655.) the present evidence was offered not for the truth of the matter statedthat jonathan said mr. lopez was his but as circumstantial evidence of people v. mckinnon, supra, 52 cal.4th at p. 655; people v. gonzalez, supra, 126 cal.app.4th at p. 1550.) further, the evidence was not crawford v. washington (2004) 541 u.s. 36, 68. (see people v. mitchell (2005) 131 cal.app.4th 1210, 1221-1222.) given that the calls the day mr. lopez, his fellow gang member, was assaulted, that the callers told jose sr. not to hide jonathan, and that one text impliedly accused jonathan of abandoning mr. or what they believed was his failure to defend mr. lopez. in addition, jose sr. testified that as a result of the telephone calls and text messages, his son jonathan was afraid to come to court. the telephone calls and text message were relevant to explpeople v. valdez (2012) 55 cal.4th 82, 135; people v. guerra (2006) 37 cal.4th 1067, 15 1141-1142, overruled on another point in people v. rundle (2008) 43 cal.4th 76, 151.) the probative value of the evidence was strong. it was not inflammatory or inherently prejudicial. the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the evidence. further, admission of the evidence did not render the trial so arbitrary and fundamentally unfair as to violate any defenpeople v. jablonski, supra, 37 cal.4th at pp. 805, 807; people v. partida (2005) 37 cal.4th 428, 436.) mr. davila argues the evidence should have been excluded as irrelevant. we idence . . . having any tendency in reason to prove or (evid. code,  210.) as discussed above, the evidence was relevant to explain why jonathan was afraid to come to court, and was relevant circumstantial evidence of mr. davila further asserts the evidence of the cellular telephone calls and text messages was inadmissible bad character evidence under evidence code section 1101, subdivision (a). hjury to make unsupported assumptions and to draw negative inferences about speculate that [defendant] was associated with these unknown callers and unknown text senders and, thus, that [mr. davila] was guilty of making threats by this assumed association. the evidence further allowed the jury to speculate and to assume that [mr. davila] generally probability standard of people v. watson (1956) 46 cal.2d 818, 836.

(chapman v. california (1967) 386 u.s. 18, 36; people v. watson, supra, 46 cal.2d at p. 836.) the evidence had strong probative value and minimal prejudicial effect. the jury was instructed as to its limited use. c. the eyewitness testimony placing defendants at the scene was not unreliable or insufficient defendants challenge the out-of-court eyewitness identifications as physically physically impossible or inherently improbable, the testimony of a single witness is people v. elliott (2012) 53 cal.4th 535, 585; accord, people v. young (2005) 34 cal.4th 1149, 1181.) here, several witnesses positively identified defendants as the perpetrators. ms. puentes and jose both la was wearing a black hat with a fish on it. ms. gonzalez could not identify the attackers. while hospitalized, jose positively identified mr. davila as one of the assailants. (~rt knew his nickname. jose identified mr. gutierrez as one of the perpetrators, but he was not 100 percent certain. ms. puentes identified mr. suarez. she knew him by his nickname. she knew him through his girlfriend, monica. mr. suarez had the name the identifications were neither physically impossible nor inherently improbable. inconsistencies in the descriptions of the perpetrators and the circumstances under which 17 the identifications were made were credibility matters for the jury to resolve. there was no insufficiency of the evidence with respect to the eyewitness identifications. (people v. elliot, supra, 53 cal.4th at p. 585; people v. maury (2003) 30 cal.4th 342, 403.) d. the expert testimony was within proper limits mr. davila argues the gang expert improperly opined on an ultimate issue in violation of although detective batres was responding to a hypothetical question, it tracked the facts of the case, and led him to conclude el monte flores gang members went to the temores home ta result, it has been forfeited.
