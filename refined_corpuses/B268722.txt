(see prop. 47, approved nov. 4, 2014, eff. nov. 5, 2014.) 2 the lead case on this issue is people v. valenzuela, review granted march 30, 2016, s232900. the order is defendant eligible for resentencing on the penalty enhancement for serving a prior prison term on a felony conviction after the superior court had reclassified the underlying felony as a misdemeanor under the provisions of (cal. supreme ct. news release (apr. 1, 3 yet s do not persuade us otherwise, we affirm our prior ruling and apply it to this case. accordingly, we conclude the trial court did not err in pursuant to section 1170.18, which sought to strike four one-year enhancements pursuant to section 667.5 on the basis that the underlying felony convictions had been reduced to misdemeanors. factual background and procedural history3 on march 17, 2013, appellant paris dixon, iii assaulted and threatened his girlfriend. on june 19, 2013, appellant pled guilty to one count of making criminal threats the three strikes law ( 667, subds. (b)-(i), 1170.12, subds. (a)-(d)) and four prior felony convictions for which he had served 2016) summary of cases accepted and related actions during week of march 28, 2016.) the court has granted review on this and related issues in numerous other cases. (e.g., people v. king, review granted june 8, 2016, s234196, people v. cisneros, review granted june 8, 2016, s234078, people v. williams, review granted may 11, 2016, s233539, people v. ruff, review granted may 11, 2016, s233201, people v. carrea, review granted april 27, 2016, s233011.) 3 s request to take judicial notice of the judgment of conviction. (people v. dixon (jan. 29, 2014, b250016) [nonpub. opn.].) 4 prison terms. pursuant to a plea agreement, the trial court sentenced appellant to a three-year upper term for making criminal threats, doubled that term pursuant to the three strikes law, and added four one-year enhancements for the prior prison terms pursuant to section 667.5, subdivision (b). (see people v. dixon, supra, at pp. 2-3.) we independently reviewed the record pursuant to people v. wende (1979) 25 cal.3d 436. we affirmed his conviction and sentence in an unpublished opinion. (see people v. dixon, supra, at p. 4.) on december 24, 2014, appellant, representing himself, filed a motion for modification of sentence pursuant to section 1170, subdivision (d), to reduce each prior felony conviction to a misdemeanor under proposition 47. on january 20, 2015, the trial court denied the motion. subsequently, separate petitions to reduce each of his four prison priors to a misdemeanor pursuant to section 1170.18. application for resentencing pursuant to section 1170.18, seeking to strike the four section 667.5 enhancements on the ground that the underlying prison priors had become misdemeanors. the trial court denied the application. this appeal followed.4 4 from default, and permitted the late filing of his notice of appeal. 5 discussion because a prior prison term enhancement can be imposed only for a felony (see  667.5, subd. (b)) and the underlying prior convictions are now misdemeanors, appellant contends the trial court erred in denying his application to strike the four section 667.5 enhancements pursuant to section 1170.18. as explained below, we disagree.5 as we have previously stated, while proposition 47 created a procedure -- set forth in section 1170.18 -- for offenders to obtain reclassification and resentencing on convictions on a retroactive basis, it does not provide a similar procedure to strike or dismiss sentence enhancements retroactively. additionally, while a re-( 1170.18, subd. (k)), because proposition 47 does not otherwise address the retroactive application of that subsection, we conclude that the misdemeanor treatment occurs prospectively, not retroactively. (see people v. brown a statute that is ambiguous with respect to retroactive application is construed . . . to be unambiguously prospective][penal code] is retroactive.) 5 respondent contends the appeal should be dismissed, as the trial court lacked jurisdiction under section 1170.18 to grant the relief requested. because dismissal requires us to interpret section 1170.18 on the issue raised in the appeal, we decline to do so. 6 finally, section 1170.18 makes no reference to section 667.5, subdivision (b), and thus it cannot be interpreted to affect enhancements under that statute. the qualifying criterion for an enhancement under section 667.5, subdivision (b) is having served a prior prison term for a felony conviction. that criterion is not changed by a later reduction of the felony to a misdemeanor, as the purpose of the section 667.5, subdivision (b) enhancement is to punish individuals for recidivism. (see people v. gokey (1998) 62 cal.app.4th 932, sentence enhancements for prior prison terms are based on the s status as a recidivist, and not on the underlying criminal conduct, or the act or omission, giving ].) appellant further contends that the failure to strike the one-year sentence enhancement for the prison priors which were re-designated misdemeanors violates his right to equal protection under the federal and state constitutions. he argues there is no rational distinction between individuals who commit the same crimes but are sentenced before or after the enactment of proposition 47. we reject this claim because equal protection violation aris[es] from the timing of the effective date of a statute lessening the punishment for a particular offense.people v. floyd (2003) 31 cal.4th 179, 188 [rejecting equal protection claim with respect to proposition 36].) the legislature properly may specify that such statutes are prospective only, to assure that penal laws will maintain their desired deterrent effect by carrying out the original prescribed punishment as 7 ibid., quoting in re kapperman (1974) 11 cal.3d 542, 546.) the voters have the same prerogative.people v. floyd, supra, at p. 188 .) as the supreme court has the ability to elect to be sentenced under a law enacted after the date of the commission of a crime is not a constitutional right but a benefit conferred solely by statute. it is not unconstitutional for the legislature to confer such benefit only prospectively . . . . (id. at pp. 189-190, quoting people v. grant (ill. 1978) 377 n.e.2d 4, 9.) accordingly, the failure to strike the prison prior enhancements does not constitute an equal protection violation. disposition the order is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. manella, j. we concur: epstein, p. j. willhite, j.
