(a); counts 1 and 2); attempted 1 because the romeros share a last name, for clarity we sometimes refer to them by their first names. 2 undesignated statutory references are to the penal code. 3 possession for sale of methamphetamine ( 664, health & saf. code,  11378; count 3); and possession of a firearm by a felon with a prior (former  12021, subd. (a)(1); count 4).3 as to counts 1 and 2, the information alleged defendant committed multiple murdersa special circumstance under section 190.2, subdivision (a)(3)and during the commission of the murders, defendant personally and intentionally discharged a firearm ( 12022.53, subds. (b) [personal use], (c) [personal and intentional discharge], (d) [personal and intentional discharge causing death]). the information also alleged three 32-year-old prior convictions and one 35-year-old juvenile adjudication constituted strike priors ( 1170.12, subds. (a)(d);  667, subd. (b)(i)) and serious-felony priors ( 667, subd. (a)(1)). defendant pled not guilty and denied the allegations. 1. mistrial and stanley i. on friday, november 4, 2011, a jury was sworn to try the case. the following monday, november 7, 2011, the court declared a mistrial and set a new trial date. on december 12, 2011, defendant moved for dismissal based on double jeopardy and also proffered a plea of once in jeopardy. the trial court denied the dismissal motion after finding defense counsel had impliedly consented to dismissal of the jury and the resulting 3 the deadly weapons recodification act of 2010 repealed and recodified former sections 12000 to 12809 without substantive change. ( 16000, 16005, 16010.) effective january 1, 2012, former section 12021, subdivision (a) (count 4) was recodified without substantive change at section 29800, subdivision (a). (stats. 2010, ch. 711 (s.b.1080),  4 [repealed]; stats. 2010, ch. 711 (s.b.1080),  6 [reenacted].) 4 mistrial. in light of that conclusion, the trial court refused to accept the proffered plea of once in jeopardy.4 defendant petitioned this court for writ of prohibition and a stay was granted. on may 22, 2012, a different panel of this court denied the petition by published decision on the ground that defendant had impliedly consented to a mistrial. (stanley i, supra, 206 cal.app.4th at pp. 294295 (stanley i).) the california supreme court denied review. proceedings resumed in the trial court on september 28, 2012. on november 8, 2012, defendant, through counsel, filed a federal habeas petition in the united states district court for the central district of california. (see stanley v. baca (c.d.cal. june 25, 2013, no. cv 12-9569-jak (sh)) 2013 u.s. dist. lexis 89456.) defendant claimed he was being prosecuted in violation of the double jeopardy clause because the mistrial was declared without necessity or consent. the district court found abstention proper under younger v. harris (1971) 401 u.s. 37, 4354 [91 s.ct. 746] and dismissed the petition on june 25, 2013. (stanley v. baca, supra, at p. *6.) on july 3, 2013, defendant appealed the dismissal to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit. (see stanley v. baca (9th cir. feb. 19, 2014, no. 13-56172) 555 fed.appx. 707 (stanley ii).) on july 8, 2013, indicating the denial was without prejudice to defendant renewing his request before the state trial court. trial was not stayed, and jury selection began the next day. 4 defendant has not argued that the trial court erred in rejecting his plea of once in jeopardy. 5 federal appeal was not resolved until after he was tried, convicted, and sentenced in this case. 2. the second trial. ury trial began on july 15, 2013. after an eight-day trial followed by nearly eight hours of deliberations, a jury found defendant guilty of the first degree, premeditated murders of manuel and roberto romero ( 187, subd. (a); counts 1 and 2), and found true the multiple-murder special circumstance ( 190.2, subd. (a)(3)) as well as the firearm allegations ( 12022.53, subd. (b)(d)). the jury also convicted defendant of possession of a firearm by a felon (former  12021, subd. (a)(1); count 4)5 but acquitted him of attempted possession of methamphetamine for sale ( 664, health & saf. code,  11378; count 3). defendant waived jury trial on the prior-conviction allegations. after a bench trial, the court found the prior strikes true. the for a new trial and his motion to reduce the degree of the crime, and sentenced him to two consecutive terms of life without the possibility of parole plus two consecutive terms of 25 years to life. for count 1 ( 187, subd. (a)), the court sentenced defendant to life without the possibility of parole based on the special circumstance ( 190.2, subd. (a)(3)) and the strike priors ( 1170.12, subds. (a)(d);  667, subd. (b)(i)); the court added 25 years to life for the firearm allegation ( 12022.53, subd. (d) [personal use and discharge causing death]), to run consecutive, and stayed the remaining 5 for purposes of count 4 only, the court found defendant had been convicted of the predicate felony. 6 firearm allegations under section 12022.5, subdivision (f). the court imposed an identical, consecutive sentence for count 2 ( 187, subd. (a)). the court stayed count 4 under section 654, and struck the serious-felony prior under section 667, subdivision (a)(2). defendant filed a timely notice of appeal on november 19, 2013. 3. stanley ii and stanley iii. on february 19, 2014, after briefing and oral argument, the ninth circuit vacated the order dismissing l writ petition and remanded for an evidentiary hearing to determine whether he impliedly consented to the discharge of his first jury and the resulting mistrial. (stanley ii, supra, 555 fed.appx. at pp. 708709.) this appeal was fully briefed on january 8, 2015. on may 13, 2015, we deferred further consideration of the appeal pending resolution of stanley ii. on july 24, 2015, the honorable gail j. standish, united states magistrate judge, issued a report and recommendation, which the district court adopted on september 15, 2015. (stanley v. baca (c.d.cal. 2015) 137 f.supp.3d 1192 (stanley iii).) the pending federal writ petition as a petition for writ of habeas corpus under 28 u.s.c  including whether he wishes to proceed solely with his existing double jeopardy claim or have this action stayed while he exhausts any additional claims arising from his intervening (stanley iii, at p. 1193.) on october 15, 2015, defendant asked the district court to stay his federal case until his state appeal is resolved. the district court granted his 7 request, and on december 4, 2015, we resumed consideration of this appeal. facts in may 2008, defendant was living in las vegas with his wife, tracey. he owned a barbershop, and wore his hair in dreadlocks, with the sides of his head shaveda style described at trial as a dreadlock mohawk. although he lived in las vegas, defendant grew up in los angeleson west 74th street between figueroa and flowerand still had family in the area. jojo. -5550. the phone was used on may 3, 2008, in north las vegas, nevada. late that night, defendant traveled from north las vegas to los angeles. by 3:17 a.m. on may 4, 2008, defendant had reached south los angeles. on may 4, 2008, defendant spent the day in the city. manuel romero lived in a van, which he parked in front of west 74th street, between hoover and figueroa in los angeles. manuel and his brother roberto had a nephew named jorge duke. manuel raised duke, and duke thought of manuel as his father. kathi preston also lived on west 74th street, west of figueroa. her mother, jean preston,6 and her son, devondre haynes, lived with her. 6 because kathi and jean preston share a last name, we refer to them by their first names. 8 1. may 4, 2008. around 5:00 p.m. on may 4, 2008, defendant arrived at he wore his hair in blonde and black dreadlocks with the sides of his head shaved and was accompanied by an african-american woman. defendant was looking for tymore haynesdefendant knew him as t-moa childhood friend who used to live there. t-mo was devondre ; he died in 1991. defendant had grown up down the street from t-moand from kathi. haynes, however, had never met him. kathi and haynes visited with defendant for about an hour. around 6:00 p.m., defendant and haynes left together, crossed the street, and walked toward the nearby romero home. haynes was in his early 30s and wearing a blue sweater. defendant was wearing a white t-shirt and a big, gold chain. a group of people, including duke and manuel, was hanging out ne; defendant and haynes joined them. roberto arrived sometime after dark, and by 8:30 p.m., roberto carlos bustos (bustos) had parked his car behind the van. bustos reclined his front seat and remained in the car, resting. everyone was smoking marijuana and drinking malt liquor and beer. defendant and haynes ultimately stayed for three or four hours.7 7 the introductory paragraph of the dissent characterizes -custody murder-post, at p. 1.) in fact, haynes was a percipient witness to the shooting, and although haynes did not have a preexisting relationship with defendant, the record reflects that they spent several hours 9 defendant told manuel and duke that he used to live on the block but had moved to las vegas. to duke, it sounded like defendant was speaking with a jamaican or belizean accent, according to haynes, defendant . though duke recalled haynes speaking to manuel, he did not know who asked manuel about drugs. manuel started making phone calls. someone else in the group mentioned weapons. duke looked around and saw a bulky shape on defendain the day, haynes had noticed a black handgun tucked in 8 parked across the street. defendant left the party with the woman; they walked down west 74th street together to look at house, which was four or five houses away. at 8:02 phone. the call was made within a mile of m while defendant showed the woman his old neighborhood, haynes waited by the van with manuel, smoking marijuana and together before the shooting. the trier of fact reasonably could 8 iminary hearing testimony was inconsistent on this point. at the preliminary hearing, haynes testified he did not see a gun but was told defendant had one. 10 joined them. the conversation made duke uncomfortable, and he left. as duke was leaving, the couple returned. the woman got back inside the suv, and defendant returned to the group next to the van. manuel and roberto walked down a nearby alley. they returned 15 minutes later. manuel went to the van; roberto passenger door, followed a few minutes later by defendant. defendant looked directly at bustos, who was still reclining in his car. haynes was standing on the grass adjacent to the curb; manuel and defendant stood between haynes and the van. 2. the shooting and aftermath. around 8:45 p.m., haynes saw a muzzle flash and heard a shot. bustos saw defendant raise his arm, saw muzzle flashes, and saw manuel fall. meanwhile, roberto was still standing in the nearby street. bustos saw defendant walk to the front of the van, then heard more gunshots. as defendant walked past bustos, he fired one more time. haynes and kirk ran away. bustos saw defendant enter a nearby suv; the suv drove off police responded to the romero home moments later. a chevrolet suburban or tahoe was pulling away as they approached. police found manuel lying on the grass near his van. he was deadkilled by a gunshot wound to the head. roberto was lying on the ground between two parked cars. he was alive, but died en route to the hospital from multiple gunshot wounds. an hour later, defendant was still in the neighborhood; he began the drive back to las vegas around 10:00 p.m. and arrived home by the next morning. 11 at the scene, police found five used nine-millimeter shell casings and one live nine-millimeter pockets revealed $219 cash, a mobile phone, and a slip of paper with the phone number (702) 352-5550 and the name jojo. a search of the van revealed a small bag of white powder; the powder was not a controlled substance. the police collected fingerprints from the van and surrounding items; none of the live round were not tested for fingerprints, police did swab them for dna. however, the lab was unable to extract a dna profile. the record does not reveal whether police collected or analyzed additional dna or other physical evidence. 3. the investigation. on october 17, 2008, haynes was taken into custody for the unrelated murder of kevin baldwin. haynes thoughtand at trial, appeared to still thinkhe was a suspect not only in the baldwin murder, but also in the murders of manuel and roberto. during his interrogation, haynes was shown a six-pack photographic lineup; he identified someone other than defendant as looking like the shooter. when the interview was over, police arrested him for the murder of kevin baldwin. the police interrogated haynes again four days later, and this time, haynes identified defendant as the shooter.9 haynes 9 as discussed in the body of the opinion, though police showed haynes the same six-pack array the court ruled unduly influenced two other witness identifications, the court denied the there were lengthy proceedings on this issue before the first trial, the record on appeal did not contain any motions or transcripts of 12 believed the police wanted him to identify someone in the romero killings, and thought that if he failed to do so, he might be prosecuted for those murders too. as they began questioning him, the police told haynes, himself one way or whatever it might be, we just need to know everythingup flater it looks bad for you because then it looks like you were hididescribed the events of may 4, 2008. he explained that the reason he did not identify defendant during their earlier interview was that he feared for his own .10 police released haynes from custody that day. he was not prosecuted in either case. a week later, on october 28, 2008, defendant was arrested in las vegas. at the time of his arrest, defendant wore his hair in dreadlocks, with the sides of his head shaved. he did not proceedings that occurred before november 7, 2011, and appellate counsel did not move to correct or augment the record to include them. in light of the seriousness of this case and the importance of this portion of the record, we augmented the record on our own motion. 10 on direct examination, haynes testified that he was still afraid for the safety of his grandmother, jean, who continued to live in the house. then, on cross-examination, he explained, as he did at the preliminary hearing, that he had identified defendant as the shooter because he feared retaliation from the real culprit, not defendant. but on redirect, haynes testified again that defendant was the shooter. 13 speak with an accent, and did not have any tattoos. a search of his house did not uncover any evidence of drug sales. 4. defense evidence. the defense acknowledged defendant was in los angeles on the day of the murders, but argued it was for an innocent purposedefendant came to the city to see his family and his old neighborhood, spent some time there, then went home. the phone records and most of the testimony were consistent with that theory. as for the eyewitness testimony, the defense argued s more consistent with testimony by carlos ramos montoya, who also witnessed the shooting, than it was with the contradictory and confusing version presented by haynes. since haynes was a liar trying to save his own skin, the s identification. montoya testified that on the evening of may 4, 2008, he got out of his car, his friend manuel called out to him. as montoya saw manuel speaking with two african-american men in a parked suv. the driver had long braids covering his head and the passenger was nearly bald. manuel turned away from the men and began walking back to his van. the men got out of the suv and followed manuel. they were angry and aggressive, used vulgar language, and carried at least one gun. the men walked past montoya. he noted their size, shoes, clothing, and hair. the man with braids was wearing a white and blue sleeveless shirt and denim shorts; he was not wearing a necklace or a chain. he had a tattoo on his left shoulder, which montoya attempted to describe to detectives. the defense emphasized that testimony was consistent 14 with the description bustos gave the police: the shooter had long braids covering his head and was wearing a sleeveless shirt. the defense expert, dr. kathy pezdek, testified about factors that reduce the accuracy of eyewitness identifications. these include lighting and distance; length of exposure to a suspect; weapon focus; cross-racial identification; disguise; memory details; the passage of time between the event and the identification; lineup proceduresincluding biased lineups, double-blind procedures, and admonition comprehension; and bias of in-court identifications. finally, dr. pezdek pointed to the eyewitness identification does not correlate with its accuracy. finally, the defense called devondre haynes. haynes admitted drugs were sold out of his house. in 2003, he was convicted of felony drug sales. in contrast to haynes, the defense argued, the police had uncovered no evidence connecting defendant to the drug business. contentions defendant contends double jeopardy barred retrial in this case and asks us to reconsider our opinion in stanley i.11 he also 11 acknowledges that his contention that retrial was barred by double jeopardy was rejected by this court in stanley i decision in stanley ii, this court reconsider its previous decision in stanley i that there was implied consent to a mistrial. the opening brief also indicates that defendant is required to raise the double jeopardy claim at this juncture in order to petition for review of the issue. 15 contends his convictions are not supported by substantial evidence. discussion 1. stanley i, which is law of the case, established that retrial was not barred by double jeopardy. a. double jeopardy. the double jeopardy clauses of the federal and state constitutions bar retrial of a criminal defendant following his acquittal. (people v. batts (2003) 30 cal.4th 660, 679-680 (batts); curry v. superior court (1970) 2 cal.3d 707, 712 (curry).) it is long established that once jeopardy has attached, discharge of the jury without a verdict is tantamount to an acquittal and prevents a retrial unless the defendant consented to the discharge or legal necessity required it. (id. at p. 712.) legal necessity exists, for such as the death, illness or absence of a judge, juror or the defendant make it impossible to continue. [citation.] legal necessity has also been found where it becomes necessary to replace defense counsel during trial due to the disappearance of people v. brandon (1995) 40 cal.app.4th 1172, 1175.) a defendant may also consent to a mistrial, either expressly or impliedly, and thereby waive any later double jeopardy claim. (batts, supra, 30 cal.4th at pp. 679-682.) affirmative conduct . . . clearly evidences consent (curry, supra, 2 cal.3d at p. 713.) for example, consent may be implied when motion for (ibid.) but consent will not be inferred from 16 silence, failure to object to a proposed order of mistrial, or simply bringing a matter to the courts attention. (ibid.; people v. compton (1971) 6 cal.3d 55, 6263.) b. stanley i established the law of the case, so as to defeat his retrial was barred. defendant contends the court in this case erred in denying his motion to dismiss for a double jeopardy violation because the court dismissed his first jury without legal necessity or consent and his convictions were therefore obtained in violation of the double jeopardy clause.12 avoid stanley i is unavailing. (1) stanley i determined that defense counsel impliedly consented to the mistrial. in stanley i, this court jeopardy claim and concluded that defense counsel impliedly consented to a mistrial. (stanley i, supra, 206 cal.app.4th at pp. 287-289.)13 stanley i acknowledged the rule of curry, supra, 12 as for the trial courtproffered plea of once in jeopardy, as indicated, defendant has not argued that the trial court erred in rejecting his plea. instead, defendant raised his claim of double jeopardy below by way of a pretrial motion to dismiss, which is an appropriate method of asserting that the accusatory pleading is allegedly barred by double jeopardy. (batts, supra, 30 cal.4th at p. 676.) defendant then sought a writ of prohibition in stanley i, challenging the is motion to dismiss. 13 the events leading up to the dismissal of the first jury. for example, with respect to juror 4, who asked to be excused in order to stay at home with his fiance who had just broken her 17 2 cal.3d at page 713, that consent to a mistrial may not be implied from mere silence, but following a lengthy discussion of case law as applied to its fact situation, concluded this was not a mere silence. (stanley i, supra, at pp. 281, 288.) stanley i reasoned, [w]hile it is true that defense counsel in this case was silent when given a final opportunity to object immediately before the declaration of a as to whether the court intended to excuse [juror 4] and whether post, at pp. 7-8, cord is at odds with stanley istanley i, supra, 206 cal.app.4th at p. 271.) the dissent simply seeks to substitute its understanding of the record for stanley interpretation. similarly, with respect to whether juror 4 could have the trial court asked for an alternative that would enable him to serve. (dis. opn., post, at p. 7.) in this regard, stanley i actually dismissing [juror 4], defense counsel had requested only that the juror be asked if there was any alternative to him being the sole caretaker. the question was posed to the juror and he had responded that there was notstanley i, supra, 206 cal.app.4th at pp. 271-272, italics added.) although it was shown in stanley i caretaker, the dissent invites speculation that some alternative existed that might have enabled juror 4 to serve. the law of the case doctrine does not permit us to reweigh the evidence in this regard. 18 the trial court to believe, through his actions and express statements, that he consented to the procedure ultimately followed by the coid. at p. 288.) stanley i construed this participation as affirmative conduct sufficient to support the trial finding that defendant impliedly consented to the mistrial. (id. at pp. 287-289.) (2) the doctrine of law of the case. under the law of the case doctrine, when an appellate court states in its opinion a principle or rule of law necessary to the decision, that principle or rule becomes the law of the case and must be adhered to throughout its subsequent progress, both in the (people v. stanley (1995) 10 cal.4th 764, 786 (stanley); see, e.g. people v. jurado (2006) 38 cal.4th 72, 94-97 [double jeopardy claim barred by law of the case doctrine; people v. sons (2008) 164 cal.app.4th 90, 98-99 [same].) pretrial writ proceedings. when the appellate court issues an alternative writ [or an order to show cause], the matter is fully briefed, there is an opportunity for oral argument, and the cause is decided by a written opinion. the resultant holding establishes law of the case upon a later appeal from the final judgment. [citations.kowis v. howard (1992) 3 cal.4th 888, 894 (kowis).) if the rule were otherwise, a petitioner who was unsuccessful in the pretrial writ proceeding would be afforded a second bite of the apple, at the time of the subsequent appeal from the final judgmentthe alternative writ or order to show cause would be relegated to the status of a tentative opinion, subject to de novo review on the 19 appeal from the judgment. therefore, the law of the case doctrine requires that an appellate decision in a writ proceeding, following plenary briefing, the opportunity for oral argument, and a written opinion, is entitled to finality and must be adhered to as the case progresses. [law of the case] doctrine is ruling so as to avoid the further reversal and proceedings on remand that would result if the initial ruling were not adhered to merely one of procedure and does not go to the jurisdiction of the court [citations], the doctrine will not be adhered to where its application will result in an unjust decision, e.g., where there has [people v.] shuey [(1975)] 13 cal.3d [835,] 846 [disapproved on other grounds as stated in people v. bennett (1998) 17 cal.4th 373, 389, fn. 4.]), or the controlling rules of law have been altered or clarified by a decision intervening between (stanley, supra, 10 cal.4th at pp. 786787.) a mistaken ruling is not enough to avoid the doctrine: (tally v. ganahl (1907) 151 cal. 418, 421, quoted with approval in morohoshi v. pacific home (2004) 34 cal.4th 482, 491; see 9 witkin, cal. procedure (5th ed. 2008) appeal,  459.) therefore, irrespective of whether stanley i misapplied curry and its progeny, or whether the current panel would have reached a different conclusion on the facts presented, if the law of the case doctrine 20 must be shown than that a court on a subsequent appeal disagrees with a prior appellate determination. otherwise the doctrine would lose all vitality and . . . would be reduced to a shuey, supra, 13 cal.3d at p. 846.) (3) no issue as to retroactivity; stanley i implicitly but necessarily decided that its holding applies to this defendant. defendant contends stanley i announced a new rule of law which should not be retroactively applied to him. the argument is unpersuasive. the doctrine of law of the case is applicable not only to questions expressly decided but also to questions implicitly decided because they were essential to the decision on the prior appeal. (olson v. cory (1983) 35 cal.3d 390, 399 (olson).)14 14 olson that the doctrine of law of the case extends to questions implicitly decided because they were essential to the decision on 399, italics added) as mere dictum. instead of following olson, the dissent takes the position cision in kowis established that the law-of-the-have been raised, but were not. (kowis v. howard (1992) 3 post, at p. 15.) however, kowis does not support the point for which it is cited by the dissent, and kowis did not overrule or supersede olson. our reading of kowis is that it stands for the proposition that the summary denial of a writ petition, without issuance of an alternative writ and the opportunity for oral argument, does not establish law of the case. (kowis, supra, 3 cal.4th at pp. 892-901.) 21 although stanley i did not expressly address the issue of retroactivity, stanley i implicitly decided the retroactivity issue iwhen it denied request for a writ of prohibition. the question of retroactivity was essential to the decision on the prior appeal, because if stanley i did announce a new rule which was to apply purely prospectively, stanley i would have granted request for a writ of prohibition. thus, we conclude stanley i implicitly but necessarily 15 16 olson decisions bind us, and [even] its dicta command our serious dyer v. superior court (1997) 56 cal.app.4th 61, 66.) prior to the 1983 olson decision impliedly undermined olson, and olson is bad post, at p. 18.) the dissent does not cite any post-olson decision from the past 33 years calling into question olsonas an intermediate appellate court, we are bound by olson. (auto equity sales, inc. v. superior court (1962) 57 cal.2d 450, 15 conceded stanley i is not law of the case with respect to the issue of retroactivity. the people have argued there was no need for a retroactivity analysis in stanley i because that decision did not make any new law. we agree that stanley i simply applied existing law to a given fact situation. further, stanley i implicitly decided there was no issue as to retroactivity, by denying the petition for a writ of prohibition and thereby 22 (4) no basis here for avoidance of law of the case; no manifest injustice in applying the holding in stanley i to this defendant. the previous panel, in stanley i, was presented with the same facts pertaining to the issue of double jeopardy. stanley i d consent. stanley i s argument to the contrary, we conclude that the instant case is not controlled by currycertainly not a case of silence following a statement indicating a lack of consent to a mistrial. while it is true that defense counsel in this case was silent when given a final opportunity to object immediately before the declaration of a mistrial, he had previously fully participated in the discussion and led the trial court to believe, through his actions and express statements, that he consented to the procedure ultimately followed by the court. thus, the issue presented by this case is one of whether defense to an stanley i, supra, 206 cal.app.4th at pp. 287-288.) 16 because stanley i implicitly determined its holding would apply to defendant, and stanley ianalysis as to why stanley i should not be applied retroactively. arguments that the equities favor prospective application of stanley i, that learned treatises did not place counsel on notice of the rule announced in stanley i, and that ethics requirements did not place counsel on notice of the rule announced in stanley i. 23 even assuming stanley i misread curry by holding that implied consent, stanley i contained an extensive discussion of curry and the case law on which curry relied, to wit, mitchell v. superior court (1962) 207 cal.app.2d 643, hutson v. superior court (1962) 203 cal.app.2d 687, and people v. valenti (1957) 49 cal.2d 199.) (stanley i, supra, 206 cal.app.4th at pp. 281-287.) stanley i then went on to conclude that curry should not apply when conduct believe that defendant consents to the mistrial. (stanley i, at pp. 287-289.) at this jsubsequent appellate panel disagree with the first appellate people v. sons, supra, 164 cal.app.4th at p. 99.) however, as indicated, mere disagreement with the earlier decision in stanley i is not a basis for departing from law of the case. (morohoshi v. pacific home, supra, 34 cal.4th at p. 491.)17 defendant also argues stanley ii 17 although the denial of a petition for review is not regarded (digenova v. state bd. of ed. (1962) 57 cal.2d 167, 178), the ibid.), and we observe that the california supreme court denied a petition for review in stanley i. (see people v. sons, supra, 164 cal.app.4th at p. 98 [noting that california supreme court denied petition for review of prior published court of appeal opinion (sons v. superior court (2004) 125 cal.app.4th 110) which rejected , denied a petition for writ of prohibition, and was law of the case].) 24 that we must disregard the law of the case. (stanley, supra, 10 cal.4th at p. 787.) we disagree. as a preliminary matter, decisions of intermediate level federal courts are not binding on us. (people v. burnett (2003) 110 cal.app.4th 868, 882.) moreover, stanley ii did not change the legal landscape with respect to double jeopardy; in stanley ii, the ninth circuit simply [o]n the present record, we are unable to determine (stanley ii, supra, 555 fed.appx. at p. 708), and it remanded to the district court for a hearing to determine whether mistrial was supported by implied consent. (id. at p. 709.) finally, we reject the contention that applying stanley i as law of the case an unjust decisionpeople v. shuey, supra, 13 cal.3d at p. 842.) as the united states supreme court stated in a somewhat different context, there simply has been none of the governmental overreaching that double jeopardy is supposed to prevent. . . . . (ohio v. johnson (1984) 467 u.s. 493, 502 [104 s.ct. 2536].) clearly, there was no government overreaching by the prosecutor in this case; [the mistrial was] just an attempt by the trial court to conserve judicial resources when it became reasonably apparent that the impaneled jury had lost so many members as to make it unlikely that sufficient jurors would remain to render a verdict in what promised to be a lengthy trial.stanley i, supra, 206 cal.app.4th at p. 290, fn. omitted.) we are guided by the recognition that ]t its core, the subjected to the hazards of trial and possible conviction more green v. united states (1957) 355 u.s. 184, 187 [78 s.ct. 221].) the policy underlying the 25 and power should not be allowed to make repeated attempts to convict an individual . . . thereby subjecting him to embarrassment, expense and ordeal and compelling him to live in id. at p. (people v. eroshevich (2014) 60 cal.4th 583, 588.) the forbids a second trial for the purpose of affording the prosecution another opportunity to supply evidence which it failed to muster its trial strategies and perfecting its evidence through successive attempts at conviction. repeated prosecutorial sallies would unfairly burden the defendant and create a risk of conviction tibbs v. florida (1982) 457 u.s. 31, 4142 [102 s.ct. 2211].) none of these things happened in the case at bar. in short, as stanley i observed, there was no governmental stanley i, supra, 206 cal.app.4th at p. 290, fn. 34.) under these circumstances, we do not perceive a manifest injustice in adhering to stanley i as law of the case.18 18 the dissent asserts it is manifestly unjust to apply stanley i as law of the case because defendant was entitled to a jury trial on disputed factual issues underlying his plea of once in jeopardy. however, defendant has not contended on appeal that the trial court erred in refusing to entertain his plea of once in jeopardy, that issue has not been briefed, and is simply not before us. (see 26 retrial was barred by double jeopardy. 2. sufficiency of the evidence. defendant contends, given the weakness of the eyewitness there is insufficient evidence to support his convictions. our review is governed by settled principles. in assessing the sufficiency of the evidence, we review the entire record to determine whether any rational trier of fact could have found the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. (people v. zamudio substantial evidence to support the verdicti.e., evidence that is reasonable, credible, and of solid valuesuch that a reasonable trier of fact could find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable ibid.) in applying this test, we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution and presume in support of the judgment the existence of every fact the jury could reasonably deduce from the evidence. (people v. kraft (2000) 23 cal.4th 978, 1053.) the same standard applies where the conviction rests fn. 12, ante.) that argument not having been made by defendant, it is inappropriate for this court to now take the position that stanley i is manifestly unjust because it denied defendant a jury trial on disputed factual issues. appellate arguments herein is that this court in stanley i erred in finding there was implied consent to a mistrial. we have already addressed that issue. 27 primarily on circumstantial evidence. (people v. thompson (2010) 49 cal.4th 79, 113.) we may not reweigh the evidence or resolve evidentiary conflicts. (people v. young (2005) 34 cal.4th 1149, 1181.) except for accomplice testimony, which must be corroborated, the testimony of a single witness can be sufficient to uphold a convictioneven when there is significant countervailing evidence, or the testimony is subject to justifiable suspicion. (zamudio, supra, 43 cal.4th at p. 357; people v. barnwell (2007) 41 cal.4th 1038, 1052.) accordingly, we may not hypothesis whatever is there sufficient substantial evidence to people v. bolin (1998) 18 cal.4th 297, 331.) a. eyewitness testimony. defendant emphasizes that no physical evidence connected him to the shootings, and he argues the jury had good reason to regard the eyewitness testimony with suspicion. defendant suggests the eyewitness testimony in this case was particularly unworthy of belief because of the nature of the crime, the different races of the shooter and some witnesses, the importance of the eyewitness evidence to the case, and improper police tactics used to elicit some identifications.19 19 miscarriage of justice from mistaken identification has been the degree of suggestion inherent in the manner in which the prosecution presents the suspect to witnesses for pretrial identification. . . . suggestion can be created intentionally or unintentionally in many subtle ways. and the dangers for the 28 in this case, the trial court suppressed the testimony of two eyewitnesses because the investigating detectives used unduly suggestive procedures to obtain the identifications.20 although two additional eyewitnesses, jorge duke and devondre haynes, identified defendant from the same six-pack used by the excluded witnesses, the trial court allowed the prosecution to present their identification testimony over defense objection. defendant also raises a concern with respect to the testimony of bustosthe only witness other than haynes to identify defendant as the shooter. immediately after the shooting, bustos identified two people as the possible shootera civilian bystander and a photograph of a dead gang member on the police station wall. then, eleven days after the shooting, bustos was shown the suggestive six-pack.21 bustos took his time and looked carefully at the pictures. he told the detective that while another man looked the most like the shooter, the shooter was not in the lineup. montoya and bustos both observation was insubstantial, and thus his susceptibility to united states v. wade (1967) 388 u.s. 218, 228229, fn. omitted.) 20 among other issues, detectives presented witnesses with a six-pack photographic lineup in which defendant was the only person with braids and his photograph was a different color than the other photos. 21 the police used the same six-pack for every witness. the court denied the defense motion to exclude the identifications by duke and haynes, but it does not appear the defense moved to exclude the bustos identification. 29 described a man with a tattoo, a white tank top, and tight braids around his entire head. bustos told the detective that the hair in the photos did not matchdefendant had a dreadlock mohawk, not tight braidsbut the detective asked bustos to look again and focus on their faces. bustos looked again. again, bustos told the detective the shooter was not in the lineup. this time, the detective asked bustos to focus on a series of facial features. bustos looked again. again, bustos told the detective the shooter was not in the lineup. bustos could not remember whether the detective next suggested the lighting in the photos might be differentbut he did remember that, 11 days after the shooting, six-pack. bustos testified he did not pick defendant out of the lineup because the shooter said that one of them looked a little bit like him, but he was not ther a year and a half later, at the preliminary hearing, bustos identified defendant for the first time. he indicated the shooter at the time, defendant was wearing a blue prison jumpsuit, was handcuffed to a chair, and was the only african-american man in the room. bustos also identified defendant at trial.22 the defense expert explained the problem with identifications like these: one 22 we note the prosecutor apparently stood behind defendant during in-court identifications by at least one witness. the record does not reveal whether she used this technique during every in-court identification, and it does not appear that defense counsel objected. 30 person at counsel table who even remotely matches the description that [the witness] gave a year or more [after the crime] real test of whether they recognize what the perpetrator looked like. [] also, the courtroom situation is a biased context, in that eyewitnesses often assume that by the time they have someone in court, they have other compelling evidence against that person, . . . . so ia biased context for making an identification, as opposed to a fair and unbiased photographic lineup administered closer in time to however, a positive in-court identification following an earlier failure to identify need not necessarily be excluded. (people v. dominick (1986) 182 cal.app.3d 1174, 1197.) further, bustos previously had seen defendant in the area at least once, and bustos testified it was easier for him to recognize defendant in court than in a photograph. moreover, in the end, the jury was well apprised of all these problems. during the trial, defense counsel extensively and skillfully cross-examined eyewitnesses concerning the accuracy and reliability of their memories; a defense expert testified about the pitfalls of eyewitness identifications; the court gave the jury a thorough instruction explaining how to evaluate this type of evidence (calcrim no. 315); and in closing argument, defense counsel argued at length about the weaknesses of eyewitness identification, including the specific problems of cross-racial identification and the effects of stress on memory and of information received after the event. the jury was provided with all the information it needed to evaluate the reliability and credibility of these witnessesand 31 the record reveals that the jury took its responsibility seriously. the jurors requested read-back of the eyewitness testimony; after a one-week trial, they deliberated for nearly eight hours over three days; and they acquitted on count 3. we may not reweigh people v. albillar (2010) 51 cal.4th 47, 60.) despite the concerns relating to testimony, the jury believed him; under these circumstancesand in light of nd the corroborating evidencewe cannot second-guess the jurydetermination. b. we may consider the corroborating evidence notwithstanding t. defendant argues the eyewitness testimony was particularly problematic because the jury acquitted him of attempted possession of methamphetamine for sale, and we must therefore that the shooting was in retaliation for an attempt to sell him baking soda in lieu of drugs and must also disregard the evidence supporting it; once we discard that evidence, he argues, only the eyewitness testimony remains. with respect to the drug evidence, we note at the outset that the prosecution is not generally required to prove motive. (people v. hillhouse (2002) 27 cal.4th 469, 503-504 [motive describes the reason a person chooses to commit a crime and is usually not an element of the offense]; see calcrim no. 370 [same].) in any event, in light of the evidence that van contained only a single baggy that did not contain a controlled substance, the count 3 verdict does not necessarily imply the jury to purchase methamphetamine for sale 32 did not progress beyond the planning stage, and thus there was no direct, unequivocal act. ( 21a [attempt requires specific intent to commit the target crime and a direct, ineffectual act done towards its commission]; people v. johnson (2013) 57 cal.4th 250, 258 [to avoid punishing nothing more than guilty mental state, there must be act toward completion of crime before attempt will be recognized]; see calcrim no. 460.) alternatively, given that the item defendant attempted to possess was not actually methamphetamine, the jury may have believed defendant attempted to do something that was not actually a crime. (see, e.g., people v. siu (1954) 126 cal.app.2d 41, 43 -school classics that there can be no corpus delicti when a husband fires a gun at a dummy in a bed, thinking it the paramour of his wife, or when an attempt is made to poison with an innocuous substance, or when a person points an unloaded gun at since manuel was making phone calls about cocaine, not methamphetamine, the jury could have concluded defendant attempted to buy cocaine. or, as the people suggest, because the evidence of specific intent to sell was sparse, the jury may have believed defendant attempted to possess methamphetamine for personal use.23 23 defendant cites two cases in support of his position that we should disregard all drug-related evidencemitchell v. prunty (9th cir. 1997) 107 f.3d 1337 (mitchell) and people v. medina (1995) 39 cal.app.4th 643 (medina). mitchell is not binding on this court and regardless, has not been good law since the ninth circuit overruled it in 1998. (santamaria v. horsley (9th cir. 1998) 133 f.3d 1242.) in medina, the jury was presented with 33 viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution, there was sufficient evidence to support the verdicts. kathi, bustos, haynes, and duke placed defendant at or near the scene of the shooting on the evening of may 4, 2008. defendanmobile phone also placed him in the area. haynes saw defendant with a gun and duke saw him with an item shaped like one. bustos and haynes identified defendant as the shooter. they provided consistent details of how the murders occurred, from vantage points that were mere feet away. after the shooting, while travelling from the vicinity of the shooting in los angeles to las vegas, where defendant lived; although defendant remained in the area until an hour after the shooting, the jury could reasonably have viewed the timing of this drive as evidence of flight and consciousness of taken together, this testimony was sufficient to convince a rational trier of fact, beyond a reasonable doubt, that defendant committed the offenses of which he was convicted.24 two inconsistent versions of events. because the verdicts indicated the jurors believed the codefendant, not the victim, the court analyzed the sufficiency of the evidence using the only facts medina, at pp. 646647, 651652.) in this case, because the jury was not presented with two incompatible versions of events, its conclusion that the people did not prove count 3 beyond a reasonable doubt does not mean they rejected the evidence entirely or found it unworthy of belief. 24 the dissent, in a footnote and without elaboration, asserts 34 3. erroneous fees and penalty assessments.25 rmine and people v. cattaneo (1990) 217 cal.app.3d 1577, 1589.) an unauthorized sentence judicial correction whenever the error comes to the attention of people v. dotson (1997) 16 cal.4th 547, 554, fn. 6.) based on our review of the record, it appears the trial court made three errors when imposing the fines and assessments below. first, the court imposed and suspended a $300 parole revocation fine under section 1202.45. normally, the court is required to impose and stay a probation or parole revocation fine equal to the restitution fine. but the court in this case sentenced defendant to life in prison without the possibility of parole. since, notwithstanding its indeterminate portion, the sentence does not include a period of parole, section 1202.45 is inapplicable. (people v. oganesyan (1999) 70 cal.app.4th 1178, 11811186.) the fine should not have been imposed, and we reverse it. (people v. mejia (2012) 211 cal.app.4th 586, 637.) second, the sentencing court must impose one $40 court security fee ( 1465.8) and one $30 court facilities assessment (dis. opn., postundeveloped and therefore we do not address it. 25 in the interest of judicial economy, we correct these errors without first requesting supplemental briefing. any party wishing to address these issues may petition for rehearing. (gov. code,  68081.) 35 (gov. code,  70373) on every criminal conviction, including any conviction stayed under section 654. (people v. woods (2010) 191 cal.app.4th 269, 273274; people v. knightbent (2010) 186 .) here, defendant was convicted of three feloniestwo counts of first-degree murder ( 187, subd. (a); counts 1 and 2) and one count of possession of a firearm by a felon (former  12021, subd. (a)(1); count 4). the court properly imposed three $40 court security fees ( 1465.8), for a total of $120. however, the court erred by imposing four $30 court facilities assessments (gov. code,  70373) totaling $120 rather than three assessments totaling $90. because one of the four assessments is erroneous, we modify the judgment to impose only three $30 court facilities assessments totaling $90. third, the court improperly imposed $324 in penalty assessments on these two feesnamely, a $120 state penalty assessment under section 1464, a $24 state criminal surcharge under section 1465.7, a $60 dna assessment under government code section 76104.6, a $60 dna assessment under government code section 76104.7, and a $60 court construction assessment under government code section 70372. penalty, or forfeiture imposed by the courts for all criminal offenses . . . . 1464, subd. (a).) on the base fine used to calculate the state penalty assessment . . . . 1465.7, subd. (a).) the two dna assessments and the court construction assessment appear in chapter 12 of title 8 of the government code, and are levied on the same base fine as the state penalty assessment and the state 36 surcharge. however, as the statutes themselves state, neither the court facilities assessment (gov. code,  70373) nor the court security fee ( 1465.8) are part of that base fineand both are exempt from the additional penalty assessments imposed by the trial court. (gov. code,  70373, subd. (a)(2) assessment . . . may not be included in the base fine to calculate the state penalty assessment as specified in subdivision (a) of section 1464 of the penal code. the penalties authorized by chapter 12 (commencing with section 76000) [of title 8 of the government code], and the state surcharge authorized by section 1465.7 of the penal code, do not apply to this assessment.(italics added)];  . . . may not be included in the base fine to calculate the state penalty assessment as specified in subdivision (a) of section 1464. the penalties authorized by chapter 12 (commencing with section 76000) of title 8 of the government code, and the state surcharge authorized by section 1465.7, do not apply to this assessment.(italics added)]; people v. valencia (2008) 166 cal.app.4th 1392, 13941396 [may not impose dna penalty on court security fee].) as there was no other fine on which to base these assessments, the court exceeded its jurisdiction in imposing them. (see people v. mchenry (2000) 77 cal.app.4th 730, 732.) we reverse the $120 state penalty assessment ( 1464), the $24 state criminal surcharge ( 1465.7), both $60 dna assessments (gov. code,  76104.6, 76104.7), and the $60 court construction assessment (gov. code,  70372). the abstract of judgment must be amended to remove the assessment, penalties, and surcharge, as well as the $300 parole revocation fine ( 1202.45) and the extraneous $30 court facilities assessment (gov. code,  70373) discussed above. (people v. hamed (2013) 37 221 cal.app.4th 928, 940 [abstract of judgment must list fines, penalties, surcharge]; people v. sharret (2011) 191 cal.app.4th 859, 864 [superior court clerk must specify fines, penalties, surcharge in abstract of judgment].) 38 disposition the penalty assessments are reversedspecifically, the $120 state penalty assessment (pen. code,  1464), the $24 state criminal surcharge (pen. code,  1465.7), the $60 dna assessment (gov. code,  76104.6), the other $60 dna assessment (gov. code,  76104.7), and the $60 court construction assessment (gov. code,  70372). the $300 parole revocation fine ( 1202.45) is also reversed. the judgment is modified to impose only three government code section 70373, subdivision (a)(1) court facilities assessments totaling $90. in all other respects, the judgment is affirmed as modified. upon issuance of the remittitur, the court is directed to amend the minute order of november 19, 2013, and the abstract of judgment to reflect the judgment as modified and to send a copy of the amended abstract of judgment to the department of corrections and rehabilitation. not to be published in the official reports edmon, p. j. i concur: aldrich, j. 1 lavin, j., dissenting: in 2008, defendant joseph carl stanley, a 59-year-old nevada resident last convicted of a felony in 1978, was visiting his family in south los angeles when a drug dealer and the evidence connected stanley to the crime, and the gun was never foundcontradictory statements of an in-custody murder suspect and the cross-racial identification by an eyewitnessa man who could not identify stanley until he saw him in court a year and a half after the shooting, handcuffed to a chair, wearing a jumpsuit issued by the county jail. stanley was the only african-american in the room. other evidence placed stanley in the neighborhood around the time of the shooting and indicated he might have tried to buy drugs from one of the victimsbut none of it connected stanley to the murders. stanley was nevertheless charged with two counts of special-circumstance murder, convicted, and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. on these facts, the the sufficiency of the evidence and affirms under the procedural doctrine of law of the case.1 but law of the case is a chimera here. 1 because i would reverse based on the violation of sufficiency of the evidence to support the conviction. in light of the contradictory, suggestive, and tainted eyewitness identifications, the lack of physical evidence connecting stanley to the crimes, and the absence of any apparent motive, there are, however, real concerns about actual innocence in this case. 2 in reality, it is a prudential rule of judicial procedure. the doctrine acknowit does not absolve us from reckoning with them. by not grappling with the prior opinion in any real way, the majority elevates procedural convenience over constitutional rightsthen misapplies the procedural rule. (stanley v. superior court (2012) 206 cal.app.4th 265 (stanley i).) as the people concede, stanley i did not consider the retroactive application of its decisionand it cannot bind this court on that issue. law of the case, therefore, does not answer a central question of this case: when a defense attorney reasonably relies on a half-century of supreme court precedent to decide that he should not object to an unwarranted mistrial, does his client forfeit his rights under the double jeopardy clause? stanley i was not just wrong on the law, however. it also resolve disputed factual issues concerning implied consent. because it is manifestly unjust to apply the law-of-the-case doctrine under these circumstances, and because stanley was deprived of the sacred constitutional right not to be placed twice in jeopardy, the judgment should be reversed. i respectfully dissent. discussion the double jeopardy clauses of the federal and state constitutions bar retrial of a criminal defendant after an acquittal. (u.s. const., 5th amend.; cal. const., art. i,  15; 3 people v. batts (2003) 30 cal.4th 660, 679680; curry v. superior court (1970) 2 cal.3d 707, 712 (curry).)2 placed twice in jeopardy for the same offense is as sacred as the deeply ingrained in at least the anglo-american system of jurisprudence, is that the state with all its resources and power should not be allowed to make repeated attempts to convict an individual for an alleged offense, thereby subjecting him to embarrassment, expense and ordeal and compelling him to live in a continuing state of anxiety and insecurity, as well as enhancing the possibility that even though innocent he may be found larios v. superior court (1979) 24 cal.3d 324, 329.) trial has an interest, stemming from the double jeopardy clause, in having his or her case resolved by the jury that was initially sworn to hear the caseand in potentially obtaining an acquittal from that jury. (see wade v. hunter (1949) 336 u.s. 684, 689 2 though the fifth amendment provides minimum standards for protection against double jeopardy, a state may accord criminal defendants greater protection under its state constitution. (benton v. maryland (1969) 395 u.s. 784, 795796; people v. fields (1996) 13 cal.4th 289, 298.) california courts frequently interpret our state double jeopardy clause more broadly than its federal counterpart. (people v. batts, supra, 30 cal.4th at pp. 685689; see, e.g., people v. hanson (2000) 23 cal.4th 355, 358360, 363367 [in california, appellate reversal precludes more severe punishment after retrial]; cardenas v. superior court (1961) 56 cal.2d 273, 275 [rejecting federal rule jeopardy].) 4 have his trial completed by people v. batts, supra, 30 cal.4th at p. 679.) thus, once a jury trial beginsthat is, once jeopardy has attacheddischarge of the jury without a verdict amounts to an acquittal and prevents a retrial unless legal necessity justified ibid.; united states v. jorn (1971) 400 u.s. 470, 486beyond the control of the court such as the death, illness or absence of a judge, juror or the defendant make it impossible to continue. [citation.] legal necessity has also been found where it becomes necessary to replace defense counsel during trial due (people v. brandon (1995) 40 cal.app.4th 1172, 1175.) a defendant may also consent to a mistrial, either expressly or impliedly, and thereby waive any later double jeopardy claim. (people v. batts, supra, 30 cal.4th at pp. 679firmative conduct . . . curry, supra, 2 cal.3d at p. 713.) for example, a defendant may signal motion for ibid.) but consent will not be inferred from silence, failure to object to a proposed order of mistrial, or raising an issue of concern. (ibid.; people v. compton (1971) 6 cal.3d 55, 6263 (compton).) been empaneled and sworn when the court declared a mistrial on its own motion. thus, the double jeopardy clause barred agree that neither legal necessity nor express consent justified 5 the mistrial in this case. (see stanley i, supra, 206 cal.app.4th at p. 279, fn. 22; stanley v. baca (9th cir. feb. 19, 2014, no. 13-56172) 555 fed.appx. 707, 708 (stanley ii).) the question in stanley i, therefore, was whether stanley impliedly consented. (stanley i, supra, at pp. 287289.) stanley argues there was no implied consent, and asks us to reconsider stanley i, in which a different panel of this court rejected that argument in a writ proceeding. the people argue that the doctrine of law of the case requires us to follow stanley i. the majority, relying on stanley i for the premise that stanley i was a just decision, accepts this view. law of the case is only one of the issues before us, however. after the time for normal briefing had elapsed, we asked the parties to submit letter briefs answering a question raised in the petition for rehearing in stanley i, but never answered by the prior panel: should the rule announced in that opinion apply retroactively stanley i the trial court of the assumption that counsel consented to a because the clear weight of authority previously held that he had no obligation to act, stanley contends he should not be penalized for failing to do so. the people, on the other hand, argue that stanley i rule of opinion did not announce a new rule, the people argue, retroactivity principles do not apply. the majority does not from an inapt civil case to conclude that stanley i impliedly 6 decided the retroactivity question and is therefore law of the case on that issue. yet even if stanley i is law of the case on every issue before united states v. miller (9th cir. 1987) 822 f.2d 828, 832.) as i will explain, stanley i is not just wrong on the law. the prior panel, through its decision, also improperly express request for an evidentiary hearing, then resolved the disputed factual issues itself. although efficiency and finality are important concerns underlying law of the case, procedural convenience should not trump correction of a clearly erroneous prconstitutional rights.3 3 principle of finality, but overlooks the caveat that finality means different things in different contexts. in a case such as this, when a party seeks reconsideration of questions decided at an earlier stage of a single, continuing litigation, we would not upset a final judgment in another proceeding. a final judgment makes a difference: it marks a formal point at which considerations of economy, certainty, reliance, and comity take on more strength than they have before the judgment is entered. as for efficiency, few additional judicial resources would be expended if the majority -jeopardy claimbut by failing to reach the merits, the majority has ensured that the federal courts will ultimately have to resolve the issues presented here. in any event, when interests of efficiency and finality clash with the responsibility of this court not to issue a final judgment wrong on the facts and wrong on the law, we should err on the side of being right. 7 i begin by reviewing the events below, then address each issue in turn. 1. the first trial on friday, november 4, 2011, 12 jurors and four alternates were sworn to try the case against stanley. by the end of the day, the court had dismissed juror 3 and ordered him to appear at a contempt hearing. on monday morning, the parties agreed to excuse an alternate, juror 32, who had childcare problems. at that point, two alternate jurors remained. meanwhile, juror 4 asked to be excused because his fiance had broken her ankle the night before and was too scared to stay home alone. the court was incredulous, but did not want to question juror would have to ask would be of an attack mode so i meanhis whole explanation i grown woman cannot stay downstairs for the this is something i cannot get into, and i see no choice unless you have defense counsel expressed reluctance to excuse juror 4, court to go into an area the court feels iwhether there is any alternative to him being absent, any alternative to him being the sole caretaker at this pointalternative that you can live with that would allow you to participate in this trial and you are comfortable that your 4 did not volunteer a solution, and neither party asked to excuse juror 4then or later. at a minimum, there are disputed factual issues as 8 to whether the court intended to excuse this juror and whether defense counsel wanted to keep him. though counsel expressly asked the court to excuse juror 3 and juror 32, he tried to rehabilitate juror 4. by the time the court declared the mistrial, no decision about juror 4 had been made. the court told juror 4 to wait in the hallway. juror 6 came next. he had arrived late that morning. upon entering the courtroom, juror 6 produced a document on kaiser permanente letterhead purporting to release him from jury service for two days. juror 6 explained that he had contracted conjunctivitiscommonly known as pinkeyeand was highly contagious. he had gone to the doctor the previous day and was receiving treatment, but he needed to stay home on monday and tuesday of that week. he could return to court on wednesday, november 9, 2011. the court was willing to

(stanley i, supra, 206 cal.app.4th at pp. 268, 272, fn. 46.) in any event, delaying the trial by two days to accommodate juror 6 and his pinkeye opened up additional possibilities for juror 4. juror 4 had repeatedly emphasized that to the emergency room had happened just the night before. that morning, when juror 4 spoke with the court, the fiance was having trouble with her crutches and was nervous about navigating the stairs alone. juror 4 explained, . . . is also clear she was learning to use them. after only a few hours, the fiance was able to get up the stairs unassisted; she only needed help getting back down. for everything else, she used a wheelchair. whether delaying the trial for two days was feasible or would have resolved juror material factual issue that was never resolved. 10 where we are at, the only problem i have is making sure my expert could be accommodated, counsel was willing to delay the trial to keep juror 6order. i think we should wait for him [juror 6]. i would rather have at least one alternate. that makes me uncomfortable 4 had been excused and did not respond to the prosethat point, the prosecutor turned to the court and summarized, would like to keep [juror 6] than not have any alternates. if it the court then reconvened the jury and explained the situation to the remaining jurors. at this point, there were twelve sitting jurors and two alternates, including juror 4 (fiance ankle problem), who had not been excused, and juror 6 (pinkeye) who would be able to resume his jury service in two because we are so short of time and bring in all witnesses and do what we have to do if your hand, and i wili cannot risk doing this. i see your hand. i will talk to you. all 11 of a suddenin this position. you have no problem now, but when you thought you would not be selected, it was okay. as soon as you got i when people hide that, it puts us in a bad, bad, bad place. again, i will tell them thjuror 2 raised 2 called up the doct the court excused the jury and left the courtroom. after a recess, the court returned and declared a mistrial.5 he 5 while stanley i implies that the court declared a mistrial immediately after excusing the jury (stanley i, supra, 206 cal.app.4th at p. 276), the record does not support that view. unclear how much time passed between the dismissal of the jury and the declaration of mistrial, [or] whether the jury could have been recalled had an objection been lodged immediately upon declaration of mistrial . . . . stanley ii, supra, 555 fed.appx. at pp. 708709.) 12 and as a result, it was agreed that if we would have had only 12 jurors, we would start over, and, in addition, i believe it was number 2 that made it fairly clear in all probability we would not have even one alternate before this was over with.

(id. at pp. 287289.) specifically, stanley i conduct implied consent where counsel: remained silent when the court outlined its plan to dismiss the jury if no alternates remained and any remaining juror objected to a two-day continuance (stanley i, supra, at pp. 270, 273, 276, 289, 293294); for two days was making sure his expert could testify (id. at pp. 273, 289, 293); remained silent when the prosecutor said she wanted to preserve at least one alternate juror (id. at pp. 272274, 277, 289, 293); remained silent when the court invited the remaining jurors to declare additional conflicts (id. at pp. 275, 293 & fn. 12); remained silent when the court dismissed the jurya dismissal that violated the alleged agreement stanley i gleaned from the record, since two alternates remained at that point (id. at pp. 276, 279, 289, 293); and participated in discussions about a new trial date without objecting to the new trial itself (id. at p. 277). the court also concluded that when he id. at pp. 289, 293294.) in sum, stanley i did not find implied consent where defense counsel remained silent while the court declared the mistrial; instead, it found implied consent where defense counsel remained silent before and after the court declared a mistrialthat is, from counsel-silence silence and his post-silence 14 silence. (stanley i, supra, 206 cal.app.4th at p. 288.)6 together, conduct . . . (curry, supra, 2 cal.3d at p. 713.) following this holding, stanley filed a timely petition for rehearing seeking the opportunity to argue that the new rule should only be applied prospectivelyan issue the court did not address in its opinion. the court summarily denied the petition. 2.1. law of the case applies only to issues that were actually addressed in the prior opinion. under the law of the case doctrine, when an appellate court decision, that principle or rule becomes the law of the case and must be adhered to throughout its subsequent progress, both in people v. stanley is exclusively concernpeople v. shuey (1975) 13 cal.3d 835, 842.) 6 although it erected a complicated structure that implies otherwise, stanley i ultimately imposed a forfeiture for a simple failure to object. even if counsel did impliedly agree not to proceed without at least one alternate, an issue that itself is subject to varying interpretations, the court below did not abide by that agreement. when the court dismissed the jury, two alternates remained. thus, the only silences that really mattered ore the court dismissed the jury and his failure to object to the later declaration of mistrial. 15 the law-of-the-case doctrine applies only to issues that were actually addressed in the prior opinion. it does not apply to issues that could have been raised, but were not. (kowis v. howard (1992) 3 cal.4th 888, 894.) thus, the legal rule announced in stanley ithat ambiguous silence could constitute the sort of affirmative conduct that clearly evidences consent to a mistrialis arguably law of the case. but, as the people concede, since stanley i did not consider whether that rule should apply retroactively to stanley, the question of retroactivity is not law of the case. (see city of oakland v. oakland raiders (1985) 174 cal.app.3d 414, 418 [law of the case does not apply to issues that were not squarely presented and determined by prior appeal, even when addressed in an unsuccessful petition for rehearing].) 2.2. stanley i did not implicitly decide retroactivity. -settled principof law of the case is applicable not only to questions expressly decided but also to questions implicitly decided because they were essential to the decision on the prior appeal. [citation.] although stanley i did not expressly address the issue of retroactivity, stanley i implicitly decided the retroactivity issue p. 21.) in support of its novel conclusion, the majority shuns recent binding authority that is directly on point in favor of dictum from a 1983 civil case, olson v. corydictum that itself rests on a disapproved interpretation of an even older case. 16 (olson v. cory (1983) 35 cal.3d 390, 399; davis v. edmonds (1933) 218 cal. 355, 358359 (davis).)7 decided in 1933, davis involved a relatively discrete issuehow does an appellate holding about the failure to object to evidence impact a related evidentiary issue in a second appeal? (davis, supra, at pp. 358359.)8 davis thus stood for a much narrower proposition than the rule attributed to it in witkin and nevcal. (see 3 witkin, cal. 7 olson quoted dictum from a 1971 probate case, which held that a prior appeal did not jurisdiction over a irs. (estate of horman (1971) 5 cal.3d 62, 73.) horman, in turn, relied on a 1963 appeal about whether a nevada court implicitly decided it had jurisdiction over a contract dispute. (nevcal enterprises v. cal-neva lodge, inc. (1963) 217 cal.app.2d 799, 804 (nevcal).) nevcal based its conclusion on two sources, the 1954 edition of witkin and a 1938 supreme court case (coats v. general motors corp. (1938) 11 cal.2d 601, 607; 3 witkin, cal. procedure (1954)  216, p. 2429), both of which gleaned their rules from an even earlier case, davis, supra, 218 cal. at pp. 358359. thus, olson and horman necessarily relied on davis when they quoted nevcal. 8 in reaching this conclusion, davis relied on another treatise, the 1921 version of california jurisprudence, which dealt specifically with the future legal impact of evidentiary rulings. (2 cal.jur. (1921)  569, pp. 967the admissibility of evidence is a decision of a question of law and is law of the case and is conclusive when the same question is general matter, however, ibid.) 17 procedure, supra, at p. 2429; nevcal, supra, 217 cal.app.2d at p. 804.) thirty years later, in digenova v. state board of education, the supreme court impliedly disapproved any broader interpretation of davis when it reversed an appellate decision that had relied heavily on the 1933 opinion. (digenova v. state board of education (1962) 57 cal.2d 167, 178179 (digenova).) in digenova, the court held that the opinion in a prior appeal did not impliedly decide retroactivity, and was not law of the case on that issue. (ibid.) the court also noted that applying the doctrine to the retroactivity question before it a id. at p. 179.) this represented a and with those courts that read davis as taking an expansive view of implied holdings. in the years since digenova, whenever the court has addressed law of the case in any substantive way, it has hewed to these principles.9 9 see, e.g., people v. medina (1972) 6 cal.3d 484, 492493 (relying on digenova to conclude law of the case does not apply to summary denial of pretrial writ petitions); people v. shuey, supra, 13 cal.3d at pp. 840848 (examining digenova and rejecting pre-digenova view of law of the case); kowis v. howard, supra, 3 cal.4th at pp. 892902 (rejecting, based in part on medina and digenovaexpress-determination rule, citing shuey, and expressly overruling another prior opinion that accorded law-of-the-case s people v. stanley, supra, 10 cal.4th at pp. 786790 (relying on medina, shuey and kowis). 18 nor can olsonnevcal be construed as redeeming daviscourse, because only the ratio decidendi of an appellate opinion has precedential effect [citations]; to hold otherwise . . . would be to conclude that a statement by this court that is not a precedent can somehow abrogate an earlier statement by this court that is a trope v. katz (1995) 11 cal.4th 274, 287) in short, olson is bad law.10 cal.jur.-davis-nevcal-horman-olson rule. the full quote from nevcal on which olson and horman rely clarifies that any exception for necessarily determined issues is exceedingly the particular point was essential to the decision, and the appellate judgment could not have been rendered without its determination, a necessary conclusion in support of the judgment 10 the majority objects to this characterization of olson and insists that because the olson dicta has not been explicitly disavowed, they are obligated to follow it under auto equity sales. (auto equity sales, inc. v. superior court (1962) 57 cal.2d 450.) yet as the majority implicitly acknowledges, auto equity sales only applies to holdings; the cour respect, is not binding precedent. (cf. people v. wiley (1995) 9 cal.4th 580, 587mention of state constitutional right to a jury trial not a cope of california constitutional right to a jury trial].) on the other hand, we are obligated to follow the holdings in the half-dozen cases discussed abovejust as stanley i was required to follow curry and its progeny. 19 nevcal, supra, 217 cal.app.2d at p. 804, bold emphasis added; accord eldridge v. burns (1982) 136 cal.app.3d 907, 921 [exception applies only if estate of roulac (1977) 68 cal.app.3d 1026, essential to the decision before the doctrine of the law of the case can be invoked [citations]. because our comment in the earlier decision, relied on here to invoke the doctrine of the law of the case, was not essential to the decision, it does not preclude us from considering the issue which is raised and argued for the first was the narrow issue presented in nevcal and horman, the stanley i court could have rendered the judgment without considering retroactivity. retroactivity is therefore properly before this court. because resolution of that issue determines whether we must apply law of the case, i address it in detail in the next section. 3. retroactivity of the rule announced in stanley i e given retroactive effect, there is a recognized exception when a judicial decision changes a settled rule on which the parties claxton v. waters (2004) 34 cal.4th 367, 378379, internal citations omitted.) decision should be given retroactive effect, the california courts undertake first a threshold inquiry, inquiring whether the decision established new standards or a new rule of law. if it does not establish a new rule or standards, but only elucidates and enforces prior law, no donaldson v. superior court 20 (1983) 35 cal.3d 24, 36.) a decision involves a overrules a past precedent[,] -unanimous body of lower court authority has id. at p. 37 [case established new standard where it disapproved a practice arguably sanctioned by prior decisions] quoting united states v. johnson (1982) 457 u.s. 537, 551.)11 3.1. stanley i departed from prior case authority. f mistrial cannot be inferred from mere silence. (curry, supra, 11 the people cite people v. martinez (1999) 20 cal.4th 225 for the proposition that retroactivity issues are relevant to a criminal case only if the case involves the unforeseeable expansion of criminal conduct in violation of the ex post facto clause. while people v. martinez addressed the expansion of a criminal statute, it did not hold that retroactivity principles applied only in those circumstances. to the contrary, the court recognized that in lysis . . . focuses on reliance and policy id. at p. 238; see, e.g., people v. birks (1998) 19 cal.4th 108, 136137 [no due process or reliance problems where court retroactively applies decision overruling prior rule that defendants had the right to jury instructions on lesser-related offenses]; people v. welch (1993) 5 cal.4th 228, 237238 prior case law overwhelmingly stated no objection was required].) 21 2 cal.3d at p. 713; compton, supra, 6 cal.3d at p. 62.) however, it clearly evidences curry, at p. 713, emphasis added.) the people argue stanley i mistrial but the before stanley i. thus, they contend, stanley had be that as it may, stanley i was the first case to hold that ambiguous silence can constitute affirmative conduct sufficient to clearly evidence consent. (see, e.g., stanley i, supra, 206 cal.app.4th at p. 12 th merits of that holding, it departs from nearly 50 years of california case law that reached the opposite conclusion. (see people v. scott (1994) 9 cal.4th 331, 357358 & fn. 19 [applying rule prospectively where other cases had required the defendant to object to omitted sentencing factors, but instant case was the first to require an objection to invalid sentencing factors].) until stanley i, california courts had always placed strict limits on the types of affirmative conduct that could imply a it could not be misunderstood. while a defendant manifested implied consent with actions, and manifested express consent with words, the two forms of consent were functionally 22 mere silence in the actions stanley i held were sufficient.12 the leading case on this issue is curry v. superior court. (curry, supra, 2 cal.3d 707.) in curry, a prosecution witness testified on cross-examination that she had been under psychiatric care, and testified on redirect examination that a the defendants asked the court to instruct the jury that the third tswhich they considered extremely prejudicialcould not be attributed to them. they did not request a mistrial. the trial court nevertheless concluded that it would be impossible for either the prosecution or the defendants to have a fair trial, and declared a mistrial on his own motion. the supreme court concluded the defendants did not impliedly consent to this course of action. while affirmative conduct that clearly evidences consent may amount to a waiversuch as when a defendant expressly moves for mistrialthe request for jury instructions did not meet this test. (curry, 12 stanley i continues to be an outlier in this regard. in the four-and-a-half years since its publication, no other california court has adopted its approach. (compare, e.g., people v. sullivan (2013) 217 cal.app.4th 242, 247 [no implied consent where, after the court declared a mistrial, defense counsel participated in discussions about a new trial date without objecting to the new trial itself] with stanley i, supra, at p. 277 [significant that counsel participated in discussions of a new trial date without objecting to the new trial itself].) 23 supra, 2 cal.3d at p. object forfeit the issue. the court concluded that when a judge proposes to discharge a jury without legal necessidefendant is under no duty to object in order to claim the protection of the constitutional guarantee, and his mere silence in (ibid.) the court based its holding on a criminal defendanmay choose not to move for or consent to a mistrial for many reasons. he may be of the opinion that no error in fact occurred, or if it occurred, that it was not prejudicial. . . . indeed, even when a palpably prejudicial error has been committed a defendant may have valid personal reasons to prefer going ahead with the trial rather than beginning the entire process anew . . . . these considerations are peculiarly within the knowledge of the defendant, not the judge, and the latter must avoid depriving the defendant of his constitutionally protected freedom of choice in the name of a paternalistic concern for his curry, supra, 2 cal.3d at pp. 717718.) accordingly, the jeopardy will best be served by firmly adhering to the rule that after jeopardy has attached no mistrial can be declared save with ibid.) compton expanded this holding. (compton, supra, 6 cal.3d 55.) in compton, defense counsel learned an alternate juror told his barber, mid-trial, that it was difficult for him to keep an open mind. counsel brought this fact 24 system. this juror is trifling with my clie (compton, at p. 63, fn. 7.) the court questioned the alternate juror, then, without objection, declared a mistrial. (id. at p. 59.) have any strong objections to what i am going to do? let me id. at p. 63.) compton found no implied consent in these circumstances, order of mistrial does not ipso facto transform counseexpression of concern into an implied consent to such drastic compton, supra, 6 cal.3d at p. 62.) the court also failure to object, despite the express opportunity to do so. (id. at p. larios v. superior court, supra, 24 cal.3d at pp. 327332 [no necessity or implied consent where defense investigation, juror testified that improperly-obtained information would prevent him from judging the case fairly, no alternate jurors were available, defense counsel would not stipulate to an 11-person jury, and counsel remained silent in the face of the ensuing declaration of mistrial].) the court expanded the rule again in people v. upshaw (1974) 13 cal.3d 29 (upshaw). in that case, the court held that 25 misstatements of law caused the need for the mistrial. (id. at p. constitutional provision against double jeopardy is to prevent harassment of a defendant by repeated trials on the same criminal charge. [citation.] this purpose would be frustrated were we to allow remarks of counsel, even if legally untenable, to result in a vicarious waiver by the defendant of his constitutional ibid.) in each of these cases, the court considered whether a defendant has a duty to act to prevent an unnecessary mistrial. in curry, the court concluded the defense has no duty to help the trial court correct legal or factual errors. in compton, the court found no duty to act where counsel initiated the inquiry that ended in an unnecessary mistrial. and in upshaw, the court misstatements led to the mistrial. the california supreme court has not reconsidered these holdings in the 40 years since upshawand has continued to rely on them. (see, e.g., people v. batts, supra, 30 cal.4th at pp. 687688 [describing curry as benefit, and declining to adopt the applicable federal people v. chatman (2006) 38 cal.4th 344, 368 [citing upshaw for conclusion that defendant could not argue the court should have granted a mistrial he did not request since . . . severely restrict such an people v. saunders (1993) 5 cal.4th 580, 592 & fn. 6 [no objection required to preserve double jeopardy claim].) 26 the intermediate appellate courts have gleaned two fundamental principles from curry, compton, and upshawthat defense counsel has no duty to act to prevent an unnecessary mistrial, and that a reviewing court should not lightly presume implied consent to a mistrial. (see people v. overby (2004) 124 declined to impose a duty upon the defendant to forewarn the trial court of legal error that will permit the defendant to assert the defense of double jeopardy in subsequent proceedings. it is because the defendant has no obligation to alert the trial court that it is about to err in a manner that sets up a double jeopardy consent when the court declares a mistrial without legal neca mistrial (curry, supra, 2 cal.3d at p. 713), they have done so only when counsel acts in a manner that cannot be misunderstood. in people v. boyd, for example, a defense witness was leaving the courtroom for lunch when officers arrested him in full view of the jury. (people v. boyd (1972) 22 cal.app.3d 714, 717718.) defense counsel complained that the arrest would prejudice the jury against the witness and the defendant, but did not move for a mistrial. (ibid.) the court declared a mistrial on its own motion. (ibid.) the reviewing court reversed. it compton consent may not be implied solely fassertion of prejudice. the refusal of both appellant and his counsel to move for the mistrial, or to consent thereto, negates any possible inference of consent id. at 27 p. 718; accord people v. chaney (1988) 202 cal.app.3d 1109, 11131114, 11171118 [no implied consent where counsel remained silent when the court outlined its planned juror inquiry, remained silent when the prosecutor agreed to that plan, and remained silent when cour [declare a mistrial] . . . declares a mistrial hutson v. superior court (1962) 203 cal.app.2d 687, 692the court had stated positively that it would grant a been a mistrial. you in people v. allen, on the other hand, the court found (people v. allen (1980) 110 cal.app.3d 698.) in that case, the jury had reached a not-guilty verdict on the charged offense of first-degree murder but was deadlocked on the lesser-included offense of second-degree murder. (id. at pp. 700702.) defense counsel urged the court to record the partial verdict and agreed that it . . . whether they -included offense. (id. at p. 704.) upon retrial, the defendant entered a successful plea of prior acquittal, and the people appealed. the court held that defense counsel impliedly consented to the retrial of the lesser-included offense. (ibid.; see also people v. mills (1978) 87 cal.app.3d 302, 310strident assertions of prosecutorial misconduct and argument to mistrial].) 28 stanley i departed from this body of law in two waysfirst, by imposing a new duty on defense counsel not to remain silent under circumstances that could mislead the court, even unintentionally, about whether he consented to a mistrial, and second, by holding that multiple instances of ambiguous silence, curry. (curry, supra, 2 cal.3d at p. 713.) in so doing, stanley i refine the holding of a prior case, . . . apply an existing precedent to a different fact situation, . . . [or] draw a conclusion that was people v. guerra (1984) 37 cal.3d 385, 399.) instead, stanley i departed by a near-unanimous body of lower-supreme court (people v. guerra, at p. 401)namely, that a criminal defendant could always preserve a claim of once in jeopardy by remaining silent in the face of an unnecessary mistrial. thus, i conclude that stanley i donaldson v. superior court, supra, 35 cal.3d at p. 37.) 3.2. the equities favor prospective application of stanley i. having concluded stanley i adopted a new rule, i next explain why principles of notice, equity, and reliance compel this ve application in this case. (see johnson v. department of justice (2015) 60 cal.4th 871, 888889; people v. welch, supra, 5 cal.4th at pp. 237238 & fn. 5; people v. scott, supra, 9 cal.4th at pp. 356358 & fn. 19; people v. birks, supra, 19 cal.4th at pp. 136137.) stanley contends that 29 because stanley i imposed affirmative obligations on defense counsel where none had existed before, it would be unfair to apply the new rule to actions counsel took in reliance on the old one. the people argue that stanley i did not adopt a new rule, that reliance considerations are only relevant in civil cases, and speak.13 i conclude stanley is correct. 3.2.1. learned treatises did not place counsel on notice of the rule announced in stanley i. as discussed, before stanley i, published double jeopardy consent to a mistrial in california. this rule was duly reported in popular treatises and practice guides. for example, one guideoften referred to as the bible of criminal practitioners in this state defendant has no duty to object to 13 i concluded ante that stanley i adopted a new rule. as to criminal cases turn on the same considerations of fairness and public policy. (peterson v. superior court (1982) 31 cal.3d 147, 151157; accord smith v. rae-venter law group (2002) 29 cal.4th 345, 372; see, e.g., johnson v. department of justice, supra, 60 cal.4th at pp. 888889 [applying rule from civil case in determining there was no reason to deny retroactive application where criminal defendant did not justifiably rely on prior decision]; people v. trujeque (2015) 61 cal.4th 227, 249 [noting, jeopardy is significantly different from [the post. 30 the declaration of a mistrial not sought by him or her; thus his or her silence cannot be deemed consent or invited error that would (cal. criminal law procedure and practice (cont.ed.bar 2013)  26.27, p. 753, emphasis added; see alsocriminal law (15th ed.) former jeopardy,  55 [suggesting that silence or failure to object to the trial law: defenses,  neither the accused nor the accresult in a waiver of the defense of double jeopardy, notwithstanding that the error causing the mistrial was invited (hoffstadt, to object or not to object: what is the consequence?, daily j.

(see people v. scott, supra, 9 cal.4th at pp. 357358 & fn. 19 [because of new waiver rule was contrary to existing case law, treatises, and secondary authorities, holding would be applied prospectively]; people v. welch, supra, 5 cal.4th at p. 238 & fn. 5 [concluding, based in part on the fact that at least one practice guide advised no objection was required, that equitable and orderly administration of the law required court to apply new waiver rule prospectively and declining to apply new rule to defendant or any other litigant whose probation conditions were imposed before the new decision became final].) 3.2.2. ethics requirements did not place counsel on notice of the rule announced in stanley i. the people appear to argue that even if governing case law and secondary authorities all assumed that silence could not imply consent to a mistrial, ethics rules nevertheless prohibited the silence in this case. because all attorneys have an ethical obligation not to mislead the court, they contend, curry and its no duty to correct a consented to a ethical issue-stanley i obligation not to deceive the courtwith stanley iaffidid not cause the confusion.14 14 the people attempt to square this circle by arguing that though curry and its progeny allow a defense attorney to remain 32 counselor and advocate with courage and devotion and to render (4th ed. 2015), the defense function, std. 4-1.2(b) [hereafter, (bus. & prof. code,  6068, subd.

(united states v. thoreen (9th cir. 1981) 653 f.2d 1332, 1336.) throughout the proceedings, defense counsel misrepresented the substitute as his client, while the real defendant sat in the gallery with the press.

(id. at p. 614.) the attorney mailed the nephew a letter to notify him of the bequest. (id. at p. 615.) the nephew replied by notarized 34 letter, explained that he renounced his claim to the house, and sole beneficiary. (ibid). the attorney did not reply to the letter and failed to disclose its contents to the daughter or to the court.

(id. at pp. 616617.) the reviewing court affirmed the removal order.

(maj. opn., at pp. 24, 25.)16 then, it 15 in light of its view that stanley i implicitly decided the retroactivity question, the majority concludes it need not decide whether it is fair to apply stanley i to stanley. i therefore emphasize that the views i expressed in the retroactivity section apply equally to why it is manifestly unjust to apply the law-of-the-case doctrine here. 16 indeed, the quote it chooses exemplifies stanley iproblems. stanley i cited ohio v. johnson (1984) 467 u.s. 493, 502 for the proposition that there was no government overreach court to conserve judicial resources when it became reasonably 41 reduces the double jeopardy violation in this case to a matter of harmless error. 4.1. the attachment of jeopardy is a core principle of the double jeopardy clause. in choosing to apply stanley i, the majority suggests that the attachment of jeopardy is not a core principle of double jeopardy jurisprudence. i disagree. for more than half a century, the supreme court has repea- martinez v. illinois (2014) 134 s.ct. 2070, 2075 (per curiam).) the moment when (maj. opn., at p. 24, quoting stanley i, supra, 206 cal.app.4th at p. 290.) as i discussed above, since the welfare is not a sufficient basis for an unnecessary mistrial, conservation of judicial resources is certainly not an adequate reason to dispense with the double jeopardy clause. (see, e.g., larios v. superior court, supra, 24 cal.3d at pp. 329332 [existence of good cause to replace a juror if an alternate were available does not mean that there is also a legal necessity for a mistrial where no alternate is available]; curry, supra, 2 cal.3d at pp. 717718 [concern for ohio v. johnson does not hold otherwise; it addresses an entirely different issue. there, the court held that while the double jeopardy clause protected a defendant against cumulative punishments for convictions on the same offense, the clause did not prohibit the state from prosecuting the defendant for multiple offenses in a single guilty plea on a lesser-included offense did not bar continued prosecution on the remaining counts. 42 ibid.) crist v. bretz (1978) 437 u.s. 28, 38.) interest in retaining a chosen jury. we cannot hold that this rule, so grounded, is only at the periphery of double jeopardy concerns. those concernsthe finality of judgments, the minimization of harassing exposure to the harrowing experience of a criminal trial, and the valued right to continue with the chosen juryhave combined to produce the federal law that . . . in a jury trial id. at pp. 3738.) at that moment, the risks of injury to a defendant are so great that the government should have to shoulder the heavy burden of showing manifest necessity for repetitious proceedings. that moment matters. (see martinez v. illinois, supra, 134 s.ct. at p. 2072.)17 17 the majority cites only inapt authority in support its view that stanley i jeopardy clause. people v. eroshevich (2014) 60 cal.4th 583 new trial motion based in part on insufficiency of the evidence after the jury had returned a guilty verdict. the opinion emphasizes that had these actions occurred before the verdict, double jeopardy would have barred a retrial. (id. at pp. 588590.) tibbs v. florida (1982) 457 u.s. 31 involved the difference between a post-trial acquittal based on the weight versus the sufficiency of the evidence. the quoted language explains why retrial is allowed following a successful appeal based on legal errors. 43 4.2. stanley was entitled to a jury trial on all disputed factual issues. a double jeopardy defense of any kind under a plea of not guilty. [citations.] in order to present a double jeopardy defense at trial, these pleas are favored by the law due to the importance of the double jeopardy rights they are employed to protect. [citations.] . . . which the jury consequently, when a defendant asserts former jeopardy as a people v. bell (2015) 241 cal.app.4th 315, 339340 (bell); see pen. code,  1020.) these rights are so important that a trial court has no discretion to reject a legally sufficient jeopardy plea. (see pen. code,  1016, subd. (3) [defendant may enter any plea without people v. blau (1956) 140 cal.app.2d 193, 215 [plea that failed to state time, place, and court of former jeopardy was legally insufficient].) discretion to apply law of the case is the denial of review in stanley i. it is grant a hearing in a particular case is to be given no pinion is in conflict trope v. katz, supra, 11 cal.4th at p. 287, fn. 1.) 44 if the facts underlying the jeopardy plea are undisputed and there is only one inference to be drawn from those undisputed facts, former jeopardy can become a question of law that the court may resolve on a motion to strike the plea. (bell, supra, 241 cal.app.4th. at p. stone v. superior court (1982) 31 cal.3d 503, 509, fn. 1.) put another way, entry of a jury determination of any disputed factual issues attendant to the plea.

(stanley i, supra, 206 cal.app.4th at p. 291; see id. at pp. 291292 & fn. 37.) and although stanley i does not explicitly disclose the standard of review used in that opinion, the panel appears to have applied a sufficiency of the evidence test.18 (see, e.g., stanley i, at p. 270 [circumstances 18 this standard of review, of course, is applied only to a trial disputed facts. legal conclusions based on undisputed facts are reviewed de novo. (see people v. superior court (decker) (2007) 41 cal.4th 1, 7.) 46 ly to legal conclusions based on undisputed facts (bell, supra, 241 cal.app.4th at pp. 339341), stanley i deferred to express and implied factual findings the trial court had no authority to make. elsewhere, the opinion reveals that the prior panel assumed the role of fact-finder itself. (see, e.g., stanley i, supra, 206 cal.app.4th at p. not ask the court to repeat what he now states he had failed to the court intended to excuse juror 4], p. 273, fn. 7 [speculating that jurors may have had prepaid travel plans], fn. 10 [concluding was a 275, fn. 276, fn. 16 [speculating that juror 2 might have needed a medical . . . might have been 277 [concluding ment, a p. 279, fn. indicates the agreement between the parties was an agreement for dismissal of the entire panel, not simply juror 2 [heart aterms of an implied consent to the mistrial itself, rather than an agreement to the dismissal of the fifth juror, which created 47 a 288289 [interpreting -ambiguous statements, particularly his could testify].) mental state.

(see, e.g., people v. barry (1957) 153 cal.app.2d 193 [plea of not guilty does not raise the issue of former jeopardy]; people v. bennett (1896) 114 cal. 56 [defenses, such as former acquittal or jeopardy, must be raised in the manner provided by law].) once the defendant has met the requirements, however, he must be allowed to proceed on any disputed factual issues. that did not happen in this case. nor did other procedural safeguards attend stanley i-finding expedition. as noted above, when it became clear that the prosecution disputed the relevant facts, both sides submitted supplemental declarations, and stanley requested an evidentiary hearing to resolve the issues. by that point, it should have been clear to the court that it did not face a purely legal issue. nevertheless, the court struck the declarations and refused to hold a hearing. in support of its actions, the court cited a footnote from a california supreme court opinion. (stanley i, supra, 206 cal.app.4th at p. 278, fn. 21, citing people v. lavi (1993) 4 cal.4th 1164, 1173, fn. 5.) in inappropriate for appellate courts, which are not equipped to try 49 people v. lavi, supra, at p. 1173, fn. 5, alteration in lavi.) then, when the opinion issued, stanley requested facts in a way not suggested by any party. at minimum, the petition demonstrated again that there were indeed disputed plea of once in jeopardy required that these disputed issues be tried to a jury or resolved at an evidentiary hearing. nevertheless, the court summarily denied both requests. 4.5. the issue is not forfeited. the majority contends stanley has not argued that the trial court erred in rejecting his plea. (maj. opn., at fn. 4, 12.) be that as it may, that narrow question is not before us. the question here is whether stanley i -finding role compels us to exercise our discretion to set aside a rule of judicial convenience, an issue that stanley argues at lengthand the majority declines to address. in his opening and supplemental briefs, stanley asks this court to reconsider stanley iin large part because that court find an implied waiver in this case, the stanley [i] court speculated as to the meaning of discussions in which mistrials were not even mentioned, [and] engaged in conjecture about what specifically objected to stanley iand he 50 moreover, as the majority acknowledges, stanley asks us to reconsider stanley i stanley ii. (maj. opn., at fn. 11.) his reliance on that case further clarifies his argument here. that court, which follows the supported by implied consent.stanley ii, supra, 555 fed.appx. at pp. 708709.) although it had the benefit of stanley ianalysis, the ninth circuit found it had questions that could only how much time passed between the dismissal of the jury and the declaration of mistrial, whether the jury could have been recalled had an objection been lodged immediately upon declaration of mistrial, and whether defense counsel heard the state trial court refer to an agreement that trial would not go forward without at ibid.)19 the ninth circuit also noted that the record in this case allowed for some unreasonable case, there is no evidence that the state trial court concluded that discharge their responsibilities diligently and impartially. no stanley ii, supra, 555 fed.appx. at p. 708.) the only reasonable conclusion to be gleaned from these passages, is that the ninth circuit recognizes that the prior panel imprudently, and improperly resolved issues that were properly reserved for the trier of fact. 19 stanley i, of course, explicitly resolved the last of these disputed issues. 51 the ninth circuit is correct. stanley iresolution of -finding stanley i was through, there was nothing left for a jury to decide. 52 conclusion y of liberty has largely been mcnabb v. united states (1943) 318 u.s. 332, 347.) for many criminal defendants, the state appellate courts are the last guardians against constitutional violations. regrettably, that is not the case today. i urge the federal courts not to overlook these violations and, at a minimum, to provide stanley with the evidentiary hearing he has never received. lavin, j.
