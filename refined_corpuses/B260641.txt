(b)-(i), 1170.12, subds. (a)-(d))1 and to be resentenced for a second strike pursuant to section 1170.126. 1 all further section references are to the penal code. section 1170.126 provides in pertinent part: under this section and related statutes are intended to apply exclusively to persons presently serving an indeterminate term of imprisonment pursuant to paragraph (2) of subdivision (e) of section 667 or paragraph (2) of subdivision (c) of section 1170.12, whose sentence under this act would not have been an indeterminate life sentence. pursuant to paragraph (2) of subdivision (e) of section 667 or paragraph (2) of subdivision (c) of section 1170.12 upon conviction, whether by trial or plea, of a felony or felonies that are not defined as serious and/or violent felonies by subdivision (c) of section 667.5 or subdivision (c) of section 1192.7, may file a petition for a recall of sentence, within two years after the effective date of the act that added this section or at a later date upon a showing of good cause, before the trial court that entered the judgment of conviction in his or her case, to request resentencing in accordance with the provisions of subdivision (e) of section 667, and subdivision (c) of section 1170.12, as those statutes have been amended by the act that added this section. ] . . . [] t imposed pursuant to paragraph (2) of subdivision (e) of section 667 or subdivision (c) of section 1170.12 for a conviction of a felony or felonies that are not defined as serious and/or violent felonies by subdivision (c) of section 667.5 or subdivision (c) of section 1192.7. s current sentence was not imposed for any of the offenses appearing in clauses (i) to (iii), inclusive, of subparagraph (c) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (e) of section 667 or clauses (i) to (iii), inclusive, of subparagraph (c) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (c) of section 1170.12. clause (iv) of subparagraph (c) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (e) of section 667 or clause (iv) of subparagraph (c) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (c) of section 1170.12. shall determine whether the petitioner satisfies the criteria in subdivision (e). if the petitioner satisfies the criteria in subdivision (e), the petitioner shall be resentenced pursuant to paragraph (1) of subdivision (e) of section 667 and paragraph (1) of subdivision (c) of section 1170.12 unless the court, in its discretion, determines that resente 3 defendant contends the trial court erred in finding his conviction for shooting at an inhabited dwelling ( 246), a serious felony, disqualified him for such proposition 36 relief, because his conviction in another count for possession of a firearm by a convicted felon (possession of firearm by felon; former  12021, subd. (a)),2 may not be a disqualifying felony. he contends the order therefore must be reversed and the matter remanded to the trial court for an eligibility determination as to that count. respondent concedes we conclude their position is well-founded. defendant would be eligible for proposition 36 relief if his sentence of 25 years to life on his current conviction of possession of firearm by felon was not based on the disqualifying factor that he was  667, subd.(e)(2)(c)(iii), 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(c)(iii), 1170.126, subd. (e)(2). as defendant points out and respondent acknowledges, the record does not reflect whreverse the order and remand the matter for the trial court to make a determination on this issue and, if the court finds he was not so armed, to determine whether resentencing would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety ( 1170.126, subd. (f)). the order is affirmed if the court determines defendant was armed with a firearm. the order is reversed if the court makes negative determinations on these two issues. background3 -9, 2 all further references to possession of firearm by felon are to former section 12021, which is section 12021(a) was repealed and reenacted without substantive change as section 29800, subdivision (a). [citation.] (people v. white (2014) 223 cal.app.4th 512, 518, fn. 2.) 3 2004, appeal. 4 a member of in hood crips, a rival gang. subsequently, on november 19, 2000, defendant drove to a house where kenneth marshall, an in hood gang member, lived. .m., innocent to brnumerous bullet holes in the house and cars parked in the driveway. three expended .45-caliber shell casings and bullet fragments were recovered. later that day, defendant and his girlfriend tami clark checked into a motel but to the motel and told clark to retrieve his gun, which he left in their room. a motel housekeeper, however, discovered the gun in the dresser of room 928, and the police -caliber necessarily the bullets that had fragmented. the gun was the subject of the possession of firearm by felon charge. it was stipulated defendant had been previously convicted of a felony. in the motel lobby, defendant told police he was not staying in room 928; rather, he and clark had been visiting a friend there and asked if this person was in trouble. the manager described that occupant, the officer went to speak with defendant but he had left. at trial, the manager could not identify defendant as the one he saw at the front desk that day. a female front desk employee testified she did not recall whether a man or woman tried to return to room 928 and did not recall seeing defendant that day at the motel. she did observe in dea similarity she could not place. the jury convicted defendant of shooting at an inhabited dwelling, with the personal use of a firearm ( 246, 12022.5, subd. (a); count 2) and possession of firearm 5 by felon (former 12021, subd. (a)(1); count 3).4 the trial court found true defendant previously had been convicted of four prior felony convictions pursuant to the three strikes law and a prior serious felony ( 667, subd. (a)) and he had served five prior prison terms ( 667.5, subd. (b)). the trial court sentenced defendant to prison to consecutive sentences of 25 years to life under the three strikes law, one on count 2 (shooting at an inhabited dwelling) and the other on count 3 (possession of firearm by felon), plus the five years on the prior serious felony enhancement.5 we affirmed the judgment. (see fn. 3, ante.) discussion proposition 36 (or the act) became effective on november 7, 2012. (people v. johnson (2015) 61 cal.4th 674, 685 (johnson).) prior to its amendment by the act, the three strikes law required that a defendant who had two or more prior convictions of violent or serious felonies receive a third strike sentence of a minimum of 25 years to life for any current felony conviction, even if the current offense was neither serious nor violent. (former  667, subds. (d), (e)(2)(a), 1170.12, subds. (b), (c)(2)(a).) the act amended the three strikes law with respect to defendants whose current conviction is for a felony that is neither serious nor violent. in that circumstance, unless an exception applies, the defendant is to receive a second strike sentence of twice the term otherwise provided for the current felony, pursuant to the provisions that apply when a defendant has one prior conviction for a serious or violent felony. ( 667, subd. (e)(2)(c), 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(c); see  667.5, subd. (c) [list of violent felonies], 1192.7 [list of serious felonies], 1192.8 [additional serious felonies for purposes of  1192.7].) 4 the information did not allege in committing the possession of firearm by felon offense defendant was armed with a firearm. the attempted murder charged in count 1 was dismissed following a mistrial on that count. 5 the court imposed and stayed the four-year personal firearm use enhancement on count 2 and stayed sentencing on the prior prison term findings. 6 the act's exceptions to the new sentencing provisions relate to a defendants current offense and prior offenses. if the current offense involves controlled substances and specified findings are made concerning the quantity of controlled substances involved, or if the current offense is among specified sex offenses, a defendant with two or more strikes must be sentenced to a term of at least 25 years to life. ( 667, subd. (e)(2)(c)(i)-(ii), 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(c)(i)-(ii).) a third strike sentence is also required [d]uring the commission of the current offense, the defendant used a firearm, was armed with a firearm or deadly weapon, or intended to cause great bodily injury to another pe ( 667, subd. (e)(2)(c)(iii), 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(c)(iii).)johnson, supra, 61 cal.4th 674, 680-681, fns. omitted, italics added.) prisoners already serving third strike sentences may seek resentencing in accordance with the new sentencing rules. ( 1170.126.) an inmate is eligible for resentencing if [] . . . [t]he inmate is serving an indeterminate term of life imprisonment imposed pursuant to [the three strikes law] for a conviction of a felony or felonies that are not defined as serious and/or violent ( 1170.126, subd. (e)(1).) like a defendant who is being sentenced under the new provisions, an inmate is disqualified from resentencing if any of the exceptions set forth in section 667, subdivision (e)(2)(c) and section 1170.12, subdivision (c)(2)(c) are present. ( 1170.126, subd. (e).) in contrast to the rules that apply to sentencing, however, the rules governing resentencing provide that an inmate will be denied recall of his or her sentence if the court, in its discretion, determines that resentencing the petitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. ( 1170.126, subd. (f).)johnson, supra, 61 cal.4th 674, 682.) in johnson, the court clarified the act requires an inmate's eligibility for resentencing to be evaluated on a count-by-count basis. so interpreted, an inmate may obtain resentencing with respect to a three-strikes sentence imposed for a felony that is neither serious nor violent, despite the fact that the inmate remains subject to a third strike sentence of 25 years to life.johnson, supra, 61 cal.4th 674, 688.) this holding strike sentence and 7 resentencing as a second strike remain subject to certain disqualifying factors, including the fact the nonserious and/or nonviolent offense was committed while the inmate was ( 667, subd.(e)(2)(c)(iii), 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(c)(iii), 1170.126, subd. (e)(2)) resentencing of the [inmate] would pose an unreasonable risk of d ( 1170.126, subd. (f).) possession of firearm by felon ( 12021, subd.
