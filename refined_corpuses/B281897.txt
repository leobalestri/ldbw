(buford, supra, 4 cal.app.5th at p. 13 similarly constructed statute, section 190.5, subdivision (b),3 in people v. gutierrez (2014) 58 cal.4th 1354, 1371: sentence of 25 years to life appears more appropriate. [citation] but it is equally reasonable to read the text to mean that a court may select one of the two penalties in the exercise of its discretion, with no presumption in favor of one or the other. the latter reading accords with common usage. for example, if a teacher informed her students for the students to believe they were equally free to pursue either option. the text of section 190.5[, subdivison](b) does not clearly indicate whether the statute was intended to make life without the same reasoning can be applied to section 1170.126, subdivision (f). because a reading that affords no presumption people v. gutierrez, supra, 58 cal.4th at p. 1371), the voters did not necessarily intend there to be a presumption in favor of resentencing. whether to resentence an eligible petitioner under section 1170.126, subdivision (f) has circumscribed discretion in the sense it can only refuse to resentence if it finds that to do so 3 section 190.5, subdivision (b) provides: defendant found guilty of murder in the first degree, in any case in which one or more special circumstances enumerated in section 190.2 or 190.25 has been found to be true under section 190.4, who was 16 years of age or older and under the age of 18 years at the time of the commission of the crime, shall be confinement in the state prison for life without the possibility of 14 would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety on the facts of the particular case before it. this does not mean, however, its discretion is circumscribed in the sense it can only find dangerousness in extraordinary cases. to the contrary, it can do so in any case in which such a finding is rational under (buford, supra, 4 cal.app.5th at pp. 902-903, footnote omitted.) appellant urges us to reject this reasoning because the rulings of other appellate courts are not binding on this one. appellant is correct that decisions of one appellate court are not binding upon another court of the same level. (henry v. associated indemnity corp. (1990) 217 cal.app.3d 1405, 1416.) however, they are often quite persuasive, particularly when they rely upon an analogous supreme court decision that is binding on us. (auto equity sales, inc. v. superior court (1962) 57 cal.2d 450, 455.) appellant also asserts that these cases do not preclude his interpretation of the statute. to the contrary, he asserts that the conceded that the interpretation advanced by appellant is whether etation is reasonable is not the relevant question before this court. the question is whether the voters intended to incorporate a mandatory presumption into proposition 36. (see people v. gutierrez, supra, 58 cal.4th at p. 1369.) in making that determination, we give the language its usual and ordinary meaning and choose the construction that aligns most closely with the apparent intent of the lawmakers. (ibid.) we agree with buford and esparza that the intent of the voters was not to create a mandatory presumption. 15 the court in people v. superior court (kaulick) (2013) 215 cal.app.4th 1279, 1302-1303 reached the same conclusion, though by different reasoning, as it predated people v. gutierrez. in kaulicka factor which enhances the sentence imposed when a defendant is resentenced under the act; instead, dangerousness is a hurdle which must be crossed in order for a defendant to be resentenced at all. if the court finds that resentencing a prisoner would pose an unreasonable risk of danger, the court does not resentence the prisoner, and the petitioner simply finishes out the term to which he or she was originally sentenced. [] the maximum sentence to which [a petitioner] is subject was, and always shall be, the indeterminate life term to which he was originally sentenced. while proposition 36 presents him with an opportunity to be resentenced to a lesser term, unless certain facts are established, he is nonetheless still subject to the third strike sentence based on the facts established at the time he was originally sentenced. sentence in his favor can be based on any otherwise appropriate factor (i.e., dangerousness), and such factor need not be established by proof beyond a reasonable doubt to a jury. kaulick would interpret the retrospective part of the act to mean that every petitioner who meets the eligibility requirements for resentencing is immediately entitled to the recall of his or her sentence, with resentencing to a second-strike term the presumptive sentence, and resentencing to the current third-strike term available only on proof beyond a reasonable doubt of the additional factor of dangerousness. there is nothing in the (kaulick, supra, 215 cal.app.4th at p. 1303, footnote omitted.) 16 appellant, who cited kaulick in support of his position in his opening brief, contends it is distinguishable because the e in response to the argument that proposition this is too narrow a that, once the trial court concluded that he was eligible for resentencing under the act, he was subject only to a second-strike sentence, unless (kaulick, supra, 215 cal.app.4th at p. 1302.) ii. no due process violation appellant next contends that proposition 36 creates a state and federal constitutional due process liberty interest in resentencing. he relies on greenholtz v. inmates of nebraska penal and correctional complex (1979) 442 u.s. 1 and board of pardons v. allen (1987) 482 u.s. 369, both of which held that statutory parole schemes can create a due process liberty interest in release. even if we assume for the sake of argument that proposition 36 gives rise to an analogous liberty interesta conclusion with which we do not necessarily agreeappellant has not demonstrated that he was deprived of due process here. satisfied when the prisoner is given notice of the resentencing as well as a statement of reasons if resentencing is denied. we agree. (see kaulick, supra, 215 cal.app.4th at pp. 1297-1300.) he further asserts that due process requires the prosecution to prove by a preponderance of the evidence facts from which the court can all of these requirements were 17 satisfied in this case. appellant received a noticed hearing, at which he was present, represented by counsel, and afforded the opportunity to provide testimony and other evidence in support of his petition. the trial court held the prosecution to a preponderance of the evidence standard and thoroughly explained its findings in a written ruling. as we discuss more fully below, the trial court did not act in an arbitrary or capricious manner in conducting the hearing or issuing its ruling. appellant accordingly received the due process to which he claims he was entitled. iii. proposition 36 is not unconstitutionally vague vague because it does not distinguish between reasonable and unreasonable risks. he further contends that section 1170.126, subdivision (g) compounds the problem. that subdivision sets forth three broad categories of evidence the trial court may consider when making its discretionary determination of whether resentencing a petitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of danger tincluding the type of crimes committed, the extent of injury to victims, the length of prior prison commitments, and the record while incarcerated; and [] (3) any other evidence the court, within its discretion, determines to be relevant in deciding whether a new sentence would result in an unreasonable risk of ( 1170.126, subd. (g).) appellant hird catch-all category renders any predictability 18 individual court to develop its own standard in defining an we disagree. ding the presumptive nature of proposition 36, multiple courts of appeal have considered and rejected the contention that section 1170.126, subdivision (f) is void for vagueness. in people v. garcia (2014) 230 cal.app.4th 763, 769, which our supreme court cited in people v. valencia (2017) 3 cal.5th 347, 355-356, the court unreasonable risk of danger to public safetyenumerated in section 1170.126, subdivision (g). the court found (people v. garcia, supra, at p. 769.) the garcia e, citing govern his conduct by such nonmathematical standards as the like. . . . [s]tandards of this kind are not impermissibly vague, provided their meaning can be objectively ascertained by (people v. garcia, supra, 230 cal.app.4th at pp. 769-770.) it held reference to the examples of evidence the trial court may consider (id. at p. 770.) appellant contends that a more recent u.s. supreme court case, johnson v. united states (2015) 135 s.ct. 2551 (johnson) undermines this analysis. johnson held that the residual clause of the federal armed career criminal act, which defined the 19 conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to (johnson, supra, 135 s.ct. at p. 2557.) the court explained that the statute -world 4 (ibid.) it reasoned that the statute estimate the risk posed by a crime because it was unclear how to determine the type of crime.

(people v. rodrigues (1994) 8 cal.4th 1060, 1124-1125, quoting people v. jordan (1986) 42 cal.3d 308, 316.) we ruling and limit our inquiry to determining whether a rational trier of fact reasonably could conclude that appellant poses an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. (see buford, supra, 4 cal.app.5th at p. 903.) appellant contends the trial court gave undue weight to immutable factors, such as his prior criminal history and prison disciplinary record, and insufficient weight to factors indicating he no longer poses a risk to public safety, such as his favorable expert opinion. he further asserts the trial court improperly questioned the timing and sincerity of his behavioral the detailed ruling of the trial court does not support 21 governing legal principles to the facts of this case. the trial court the petitioner currently poses an unreasonable risk of danger to (esparza, supra, 242 cal.app.4th at p. 746, citing in re lawrence (2008) 44 cal.4th 1181, 1214 and in re shaputis (2008) 44 cal.4th 1241, 1254.) further, the trial court considered whether there was a nexus between apcriminal history and concluded there was, based on his extensive prison disciplinary history, limited participation in rehabilitative -release plans. of serious misbehavior in prison, including an incident in which he stabbed a fellow inmate in the willingness to engage in serious rule breaking behavior despite having received a criminal sanct (in re rozzo (2009) 172 cal.app.4th 40, 60.) probative value of his current dangerousness in light of intervening good behavior, such misconduct continues to have (ibid.) the trial court appropriately relied on this evidence, which is one of the categories enumerated in section 1170.126, resentencing. the trial court also was entitled credibility and the sincerity of his transformation. credibility is a matter within the province of the trial court, and we do not revisit its determinations. (see people v. lee (2011) 51 cal.4th 620, 632.) appellant testified that he did not know proposition 36 existed when he requested placement on the special needs yard despite having filed his petition for resentencing nearly four 22 months earlier. he also declined to accept responsibility for injuring a correctional officer during the 2002 heroin incident. threat the inmate currently poses to public safety. (in re shaputis (2011) 53 cal.4th 192, 218.) appellant contends the trial court erroneously found his post-release plans inadequate. he points to his acceptance into the transitional home and his lauded job skills. the trial court housing plans were tentative, that he had proffered no evidence of family or financial support, and that he had not yet earned his g.e.d. despite having the opportunity to do so while incarcerated. entry into substance abuse programmingmore than a year after he filed his petition, and the limited 150-day duration of his successful participation. the trial court did not abuse its discretion. the evidence viewed as a whole and in the light most favorable to the trial unreasonable risk of danger to public safety despite his recent efforts at reform. 23 disposition the order of the trial court is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports collins, j. we concur: epstein, p. j. manella, j.
