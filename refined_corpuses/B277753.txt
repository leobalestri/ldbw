(avila i, supra, b260179, at pp. 35.) discussion i. the trial court properly sentenced defendant to consecutive terms on counts 5, 6, 10, and 11 defendant argues that the trial court erred when it ordered the sentences on counts 5, 6, 10, and 11 to run consecutively. evidence concerning the unlawful acts the defendant was convicted of and determines whether they occurred on the same or different occasions and under the same or different people v. coelho (2001) 89 cal.app.4th 861, o or more current felony convic. . . consecutive sentencing is not required under the [t]here people v. lawrence (2000) 24 cal.4th 219, 233.) 7 ies are serious or violent, and were not committed on the same occasion, and do not arise from the same set of operative facts, the trial court must impose the sentences for these offenses consecutive to each other sentence for any other conviction for which the defendant may be consecutively sentenced in the people v. hendrix (1997) 16 cal.4th 508, 513514.) as the parties agree, the trial court retains discretion whether to impose concurrent or consecutive terms. (people v. durant (1999) 68 cal.app.4trbed, and reversal of the judgment is not required, unless the trial court exercised its discretion in an arbitrary, capricious, or patently absurd manner that resulted in a manifest miscarriage people v. hovarter (2008) 44 cal.4th 983, 1004.) defendant does not argue that the trial court abused its because the offense conduct was committed on the same occasion thus, according to defendant, consecutive sentences were not required. while . . . so thus, there was no abuse of discretion. but the record shows that the trial court was aware of its he conduct was so reprehensibleconsecutive sentences were appropriate. in counts 5 and 6, defendant pointed a gun at sumei lui and demanded her purse. when she screamed, her daughter, diana, ran out of the house. defendant fired a bb gun at diana 8 five to 10 times, striking her three times. in counts 10 and 11, defendant rushed towards wong and her two-year-old son with a bb gun. as wong kneeled while holding her son, defendant took her laptop and demanded her purse. he shot wong in the face with the bb gun as she held her son. in light of this evidence, sentences. ii. the resentencing hearing defendant argues that the trial court abused its discretion when it denied his motion under section 1050 to continue the resentencing hearing. the granting of a request made by a defendant for a continuance rests within the discretion of the trial court. (people v. wilson (1965) 235 cal.app.2d 266, 272273.) absent an abuse of discretion and a showing of prejudice, a denial of the continuance cannot serve as the basis for reversal of a judgment of conviction. (people v. justice (1963) 211 cal.app.2d 660, 665.) an exercise of discretion must not be disturbed on appeal except on a showing that the court exercised its discretion in an arbitrary, capricious, or patently absurd manner that resulted in a manifest miscarriage of justice. (people v. jordan (1986) 42 cal.3d 308, 316.) the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying was held on july 22, 2016, for the sole purpose of determining concurrent. at the hearing, defendant moved for a continuance pursuant to section 9 updated psychological evaluation, any mitigation expert to address and properly present a full scope of information for the court and then to address . . . whether to exercise its discretion or inclined to continue the matter for that purpose. the reason [is] that, first of all, the court, when i sentenced the defendant, i considered all of the relevant information at the time that was provided to me which included a lengthy sentencing brief that was prepared by counsel. it also had a full description of the , history, and psychological issues that may have been involved in the defenwhich at the time counsel had indicated was, perhaps, a matters. [] go through a full blo decision was arbitrary or capricious. as the trial court aptly noted, the only question was whether the terms should be consecutive or concurrent. the trial court had before it all relevant information fendant decision hinged on the gravity of his offenses. it follows that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that an updated psychological evaluation or a mitigation expert would not have been useful in this determination. 10 disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. _____________________, acting p. j. ashmann-gerst we concur: ________________________, j. chavez ________________________, j. hoffstadt
