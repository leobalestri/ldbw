(pen. code,  594, subd. (b)(1).) the district attovandalism arrest, summarily revoked. on april 9, 2013, after a hearing, defendant was found in violation of probation. he was sentenced to five years for the violation of health and safety code section 11352. no sentence was imposed for the prior prison term allegation. the felony vandalism case the court signed an order requiring 1 due to the nature of the appeal, we do not set forth the facts of the underlying cases involved. 2 all further undesignated statutory references are to the penal code. 3 defendant to pay $1,200 for damage done to the victim of the vandalism, pollo campero restaurant.3 this appeal followed. discussion the parties agree that in this posture of the case defendant cannot be compelled to pay restitution for criminal conduct for which he was not convicted, and the matter must be remanded for the trial court to render a sentencing decision on the prior prison term allegation. they are correct on both counts. generally, restitution awards pursuant to section 1202.4 are limited to losses resulting from criminal conduct for which a defendant is convicted. (people v. woods (2008) 161 cal.app.4th 1045, 1049.) although there is authority that allows a trial court conduct as a condition of probation (people v. carbajal (1995) 10 cal.4th 1114, 1121), a court lacks the power to do so when, as here, probation is revoked and sentence is imposed. (people v. woods, supra, 161 cal.app.4th at p. 1050.) with respect to the section 667.5, subdivision (b) prior prison term allegation, the the mandatory one-year term resulted in a legally unauthorized sentence that may be corrected on appeal. (people v. garcia (2008) 167 cal.app.4th 1550, 1562.) the matter must be remanded for the trial court to exercise its discretion to either impose the one-year term or strike it and provide reasons pursuant to section 1385. (see people v. bradley (1998) 64 cal.app.4th 386, 391-392.) the attorney general also points out that when the trial court orally pronounced judgment, it did not impose the mandatory $30 court construction fee pursuant to government code section 70373. we agree. in addition, the minute order does not reflect that the court imposed the $50 laboratory analysis fee pursuant to health and safety code section 11372.5. we further observed that the trial court failed to add the 3 order. 4 required penalties pursuant to section 1464 and government code section 76000 to the laboratory analysis fine. that oversight resulted in an unauthorized sentence. (people v. talibdeen (2002) 27 cal.4th 1151, 1153.) when an assessment mandatory, their (people v. castellanos (2009) 175 cal.app.4th 1524, 1530.) disposition the restitution order requiring defendant to pay $1,200 to the pollo campero restaurant is vacated. the matter is remanded for the trial court to make a sentencing decision with respect to the section 667.5, subdivision (b) prior prison term allegation and to amend the abstract of judgment to reflect the sentence, if any, imposed with respect to that allegation, the imposition of a $30 fee pursuant to government code section 70373, the $50 laboratory analysis fee pursuant to health and safety code section 11372.5, and the penalties pursuant to section 1464 and government code section 76000. the clerk is directed to forward a copy of the amended abstract to the department of corrections and rehabilitation. not to be published in the official reports edmon, j.* we concur: epstein, p. j. willhite, j. * judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
