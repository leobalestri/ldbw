(pen. code,  12022.1.)3 as to counts 1 and 2, it was alleged that appellant had suffered five prior serious or violent felony convictions within the meaning 1170.12, subd. (b), 667, subds. (b)-(j).) as to all counts, it was alleged that appellant had suffered five prior convictions of a serious felony. ( 1170, subd. (h)(3), 1192.7, 667.5, subd. (c).) on september 22, 20no contest to counts 1 and 6. appellant also admitted the on-bail allegation and that he suffered a prior strike. the trial court dismissed the remaining counts and allegations. appellant was sentenced to eight years in state prison, consisting of the low term of two years for count 6, doubled to four years due to the prior strike, plus a consecutive two-year on-bail enhancement. for count 1, appellant received a consecutive term of two 1 2 this case was consolidated with three others (ba417442, ba417953 & ba419323). 3 all further statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise indicated. 3 years in state prison. the court ordered appellant to pay various fines and fees and awarded him 644 days of presentence custody credit. marsden hearing seven months prior to his plea, on february 11, 2014, which was 15 days prior to the scheduled start of trial, appellant made a motion to replace his appointed defense counsel under people v. marsden (1970) 2 cal.3d 118 (marsden). appellant complained never spoke to him longer than 15 seconds, ainst possible help i can. you can send me to prison, but if i get out, what start advocating the trial court denied the motion, stating that appellant was in the hands of a handling the case appropriatelywas no basis to relieve counsel. faretta claim immediately upon the denial of his marsden motion, appellant like to execute my ferreta [sic back in open court, the trial court denied the faretta motion stating: cmarsden. it appears under the case law, it is not a valid indication of his right to notice of appeal on october 1, 2014, appellant filed a notice of appeal and a request for certificate of probable cause pursuant to section 1237.5. his request claimed that his plea was not knowing and voluntary and that his attorney misrepresented the time to be served; the 4 request did not mention the faretta issue. on october 17, 2014, the trial court denied the requested certificate. discussion as an initial matter, we note the parties dispute whether appellant was required to obtain a certificate of probable cause under section 1237.5 in order to proceed with his appeal.4 while we believe that appellant was in fact required to obtain such a certificate in light of his plea, we nevertheless address the merits of his appeal given that both parties have fully briefed the issue of whe faretta request. i. equivocal request a criminal defendant has a constitutional right to counsel at all critical stages of a criminal prosecution. (people v. doolin (2009) 45 cal.4th 390, 453; people v. tena (2007) 156 cal.app.4th 598, 604.) the right to counsel may be waived by a criminal defendant who elects to represent himself at trial. (faretta, supra, 422 u.s. at pp. 807, 834835; people v. doolin, supra, at p. 453.) -people v. doolin, supra, 45 cal.4th at p. 453; people v. marshall (1997) 15 cal.4th 1, 2223.) a motion made in passing anger or frustration, an ambivalent motion, or one made for the purpose of delay or to frustrate the orderly administration of justice may be denied. (people v. marshall, supra, at p. 23.) 4 judgment of conviction upon a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, . . . except where both of the following are met: statement, executed under oath or penalty of perjury showing reasonable constitutional, jurisdictional, or other grounds going to the legality of the proceedings. [] (b) the trial court has executed and filed a certificate of probable cause for such appeal with the clerk california supreme court in people v. johnson (2009) 47 cal.4th 668, 677 involve an appeal based on the denial of a motion to suppress evidence under section 1538.5 or on grounds that arose after entry of the plea that 5 (id. at p. 20; people v. tena, supra, 156 cal.app.4th at p. 604.) -representation is waived unless defendants articulately and unmistakably demand to proceed pro se (people v. stanley (2006) 39 cal.4th 913, 932.) when determining whether a faretta [citation.] request or one made under the cloud of emotion may be (people v. tena, supra, 156 cal.app.4th at p. 607; people v. marshall, supra, 15 cal.4th at pp. 21, 23.) -representation may occur where the defendant tries to manipulate the proceedings by switching between requests for counsel and for self-re (people v. lewis and oliver (2006) 39 cal.4th 970, 1002.) motion for self-representation. and conduct to decide whether he or she truly wishes to give up the right to counsel and represent himself or herself and unequivocally has made that (people v. marshall, supra, at pp. 2526; people v. tena, supra, 156 cal.app.4th at p. 607.) plying these principles, courts have concluded that under some circumstances, remarks facially resembling requests for self-representation were equivocal, insincere, or the transitory (people v. tena, supra, at p. 607.) in determining on appeal whether the defendant invoked the right to self-representation, this court examines the entire record de novo. (people v. dent (2003) 30 cal.4th 213, 218.) so long as the decision under review is correct on any ground appearing in the record, this court may affirm even if the lower court followed an erroneous path of reasoning. (people v. castagne (2008) 166 cal.app.4th 727, 734.) had properly denied faretta demands made under those circumstances [immediately upon denial of a marsden (see people v. tena, supra, 156 cal.app.4th at pp. 608609 [where faretta requests were made only after denial of 6 marsden motions, and remarks appeared for representation by private counsel, denial was proper]; people v. valdez (2004) 32 cal.4th 73, 9899 -representation, made immediately following denial of marsden motion, supports conclusion that defendant did not make an unequivocal faretta motion]; people v. scott (2001) 91 cal.app.4th 1197, 1205 [faretta motion was equivocal where defendant made the motion immediately after the trial court denied his marsden motion and defendants comments suggested he made the motion because the court would not replace his attorney with a different public defender].) appellant nevertheless argues there was no indication here that his faretta demand was anything other than unequivocal and points out that he asked to say we agree with the people that the during the marsden hearing show that his primary concern was getting new counsel appointed rather than exercising his right to represent himself. the record supports the conclusion that appellant sought to represent himself only because he was upset and present him. for example, he told the court during the marsden hearing that he needed the best possible help, better communication, and an attorney to start advocating for him. our review of the marsden transcript makes clear that appellant was upset with his appointed counsel. appellant suggests that he was prevented from renewing his faretta motion . but the record shows that in the seven months between his faretta claim and his plea, appellant never renewed his right to self-representation. when a request for self-representation is made as an impulsive response to the denial of a motion for substitute counsel, and is not renewed at a later date, it is not unequivocal. (valdez, supra, 32 cal.4th at pp. 9899; people v. barnett (1998) 17 cal.4th 1044, 1087; people v. scott, supra, 91 cal.app.4th at p. 1205; jackson v. ylst (9th cir. 1990) 921 f.2d 882, 888.) 7 ii. abandoned claim abandoned his faretta request. as appellant acknowledges, when a -representation is followed by his acceptance of representation by court-appointed attorneys without requesting self-representation, he demonstrates that he abandoned any desire to invoke his faretta rights. (people v. stanley, supra, 39 cal.4th at pp. 930933; people v. weeks may, by his or her conduct, indicate abandonment or withdrawal of a request for self-representati appellant argues, however, that any further faretta request by him would have been futile because he was faretta request. er his faretta request was denied by judge bachner, he appeared with counsel before a different judge. yet, he still failed to renew his faretta request. a defendant who sincerely seeks to represent himself has a responsibility to speak up. (people v. kenner (1990) 223 cal.app.3d 56, 62.) appellant then appeared six more times before judge bachner (on apr. 3, june 19, july 17, aug. 6, sept. 4, & sept. 22, 2014). he was represented at each of these hearings by a different public defender than the one he sought to have replaced. but, again, in none of these proceedings did he renew his faretta request, or even suggest that he was interested in self-representation. appellant allowed his counsel to negotiate a plea with the people and then accepted the benefits of that agreement. he cannot now be heard to complain that the denial of his right to waive counsel and represent himself requires reversal.5 5 in light of our cfaretta request was timely made. 8 disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. __________________________, acting p. j. ashmann-gerst we concur: _____________________________, j. chavez ____________________________, j. hoffstadt
