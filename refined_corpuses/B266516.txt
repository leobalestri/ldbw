(d)), she sought to have the offense reclassified as a misdemeanor under penal code section 1170.18, a provision enacted pursuant to proposition 47.1 when the trial court declined to reclassify the offense, she pleaded nolo contendere to the charge pursuant to a plea agreement. she contends the court erred in denying her reclassification petition. we agree, and thus reverse the judgment and remand for further proceedings. relevant factual and procedural background the limited record before us discloses the following facts: in august 2015, while appellant was driving in whittier, police officers stopped her car because the vehicle registration had expired. appellant told the officers she was on probation officers found a debit card 2 on august 11, 2015, a felony complaint was filed charging appellant with one count of grand theft ( 484e, subd.

(people v. thompson (2015) 243 cal.app.4th 413, review granted mar. 9, 2016, s232212; people v. romanowski (2015) 242 cal.app.4th 151, review granted jan. 20, 2016, s231405; people v. cuen (2015) 241 cal.app.4th 1227, review granted jan. 20, 2016, s231107; people v. grayson (2015) 241 cal.app.4th 454, review granted jan. 20, 2016, s231757.) those decisions reflect a division of opinion regarding the issue. we agree with a prior decision of this court, which concluded that the pertinent reclassification statute enacted by proposition 47 applies to section 484e(d). (thompson, supra, 243 cal.app.4th 413, review granted.) 3 generally, a defendant may not take an appeal from a judgment of conviction entered on a plea of guilty or nolo contendere unless he has filed in the superior court a statement of certificate grounds[] which go to the legality of the proceedings, including the validity of his plea, and has obtained from the superior court a certificate of probable cause for the appeal.people v. mendez (1999) 19 cal.4th 1084, 1095.) 4 in november 2014, the electorate approved proposition 47, which makes certain theft-related and drug-related offenses misdemeanors. (people v. rivera (2015) 233 cal.app.4th 1085, 1091 (rivera).) the goal of proposition 47 was to reduce the cost of housing petty criminalspeople v. myers (mar. 17, 2016, no. c078277) __ cal.app.4th __, __ [2016 cal.app. lexis 202, at *14.) proposition otwithstanding section 487 or any other provision of law defining grand theft, obtaining any property by theft where the value of the money, labor, real or personal property taken does not exceed nine hundred fifty dollars . . . shall be considered petty theft proposition 47 also added section 1170.18, which creates a resentencing procedure for persons convicted of felony offenses now classified as misdemeanors.4 (rivera, supra, 233 cal.app.4th at pp. 1092-1093.) in interpreting a voter initiative . . . we apply the same principles that govern statutory construction. [citation.] thus, we turn first to the language of the statute, giving the words their ordinary meaning. [citation.] the statutory language must also be construed in the context of the statute as a whole and the overall statutory scheme [in light of the electorates intent]. [citation.] when the 4 felony sentence for a reclassified offense who satisfies certain eligibility criteria may request resentencing. (rivera, supra, 233 cal.app.4th at p. 1092.) in addition, under subdivision (f) of section 1170.18, persons who have completed felony sentences for reclassified offenses may request redesignation of the offense (rivera, supra, at p. 1093.) as the parties do not address whether the resentencing procedure permitted appellant to seek reclassification of the charged offense prior to the imposition of her sentence, we do not examine that question. 5 language is ambiguous, we refer to other indicia of the voters intent, particularly the analyses and arguments contained in the official ballot pamphlet. [citation.] [citation.] in other words, our primary purpose is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the voters who passed the initiative measure. (people v. briceno (2004) 34 cal.4th 451, 459. subdivision (a) of section 490.2, by its plain language, manifests an intent to encompass all penal code sections defining grand theft, as it provides that it is applicable otwithstanding section 487 or any other provision of law defining grand theft . . . .(italics added.) the italicized phrase thus applies to section 484e(d), which expressly defines the acquisition or retention of access card account information with the intent to defraud as a type of grand theft. the value of an access card itself is slight, as is the value of the information it contains, which acquires significant worth only when used. (see united states rubber co. v. union bank & trust co.

(nov. 4, 2014) text of prop. 47,  18, p. 74), we conclude that the offense charged against appellant is properly regarded as a misdemeanor. the complaint alleged under section 484e(d) that appellant engaged in grand theft by [ing] and retain[ing] possession of access card account he violation of section 484e(d) charged against appellant thus constituted obtaining [of ] property by theft where the value of the . . . personal property taken [did] not 6 exceed [$950], for purposes of section 490.2. accordingly, the trial court erred in charged against her as a misdemeanor. the remaining question concerns the appropriate remedy. as appellant entered into the plea agreement following the erroneous ruling, the judgment based on that agreement must be reversed and the matter remanded for further proceedings, during which appellant shall be permitted to withdraw her plea. (see in re vargas (2000) 83 cal.app.4th 1125, 1141-1144.) disposition the judgment is reversed, and the matter is remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion, with directions that appellant shall be entitled to withdraw her plea. not to be published in the official reports manella, j. we concur: epstein, p. j. collins, j.
