(people v. wende, supra, 25 cal.3d 436.) this court advised defendant of the opportunity to file a supplemental brief. he filed none. we conclude that defendant has not demonstrated reversible error. that he was of guilty or nolo contendere. it is true that the sentencing minute order does not specify victim restitution as a condition of probation. victim restitution, however, was mandatory here. (cal. const., art i,  28, subd. (b)(13)(b); pen. code,  1202.4, subd. (f); people v. rowland (1997) 51 cal.app.4th 1745, 1751victim restitution is mandatory and a sentence without such an award is invalid.) we also observe that the preplea report checked the box for victim restitution in the amount of $206,000. defendant [moreover] need not be informed of the possibility of a restitution 5 (people v. campbell (1994) 21 cal.app.4th 825, 830, citing people v. goulart (1990) 224 cal.app.3d 71, 81.) appeal eschews any attack on the validity of his plea. the record demonstrates that the prosecution satisfied its burden to prove the amount of restitution by a preponderance of the evidence. (people v. holmberg (2011) 195 cal.app.4th 1310, 1319regarding valuation is prima facie evidence of loss].) the victim testified about value and had two appraisals to support her valuations. this was sufficient to support the trial (people v. prosser (2007) 157 cal.app.4th 682, 691692.) we have reviewed the record and find no arguable issue. appointed counsel has fully complied with his responsibilities and no arguable issue exists.
