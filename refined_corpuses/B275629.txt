(1978) 21 cal.3d 888, 892-894.) defendant suggests that we must independently review the facts because the trial court made no express findings of fact. we disagree, and note that the authorities cited by defendant do not so hold. (see people v. hernandez (2008) 45 cal.4th 295, 298-299 deferential substantial evidence standard]; people v. durazo implied factual findings that are supported by substantial .) we apply a deferential substantial evidence standard of ngs were not express. 5 (see people v. weaver (2001) 26 cal.4th 876, 924.) determining whether, on the facts so found, the search or seizure was reasonable under the fourth amendment, we exercise our independent judgment.

[] [a] vehicle shall be driven as nearly as practical entirely within a single lane and shall not be moved from the lane until such movement can be deputy carbajal did not remember whether there was a visible line down the middle of the street, but it was a two-way street, and , a violation 1 all further statutory references are to the vehicle code unless otherwise indicated. 6 of the vehicle code. deputy carbajal did not specify, however, what particular vehicle code section he had in mind, and at no time did he mention section 21658. as respondent points out, what deputy carbajal described was a violation of section 21650, which requires driving on the right side of the road and does not mention markings or dividers. defendant counters, in essence, that because deputy the stop could be justified only by a reasonable suspicion that defendant was violating section 21658 and not some other provision. he reasons that because a federal court has referred to section 21658 as lane straddling statute,necessarily applies only to section 21658. (see united states v. colin (9th cir. 2002) 314 f.3d 439, 441-443.) in that case, however, there was no languags a legal term with a specific definition; nor did the court compare section 21658 with section 21650, or even mention section 21650. further, while the other cases upon which defendant relies discussed section 21658 or its predecessor, former section 526, neither involved the legality of a traffic stop or a legal definition . (see moore v. miller (1942) 51 cal.app.2d 674, 682 [swerve was not a violation of section 526, but rather, another statute]; people v. butler (1978) 81 cal.app.3d supp. 6, 7-8 [violation occurs when driver either straddles a lane or changes a lane unsafely].) winvolving a mistake of fact or law,2 as defendant has not 2 a mistake of fact occurs when the facts turn out to be not what the officer thought, while a mistake of law occurs when the law turns out to be not what the officer thought. (heien v. north carolina (2014) __ u.s. __ [135 s.ct. 530, 538] (heien).) 7 demonstrated that an officer must articulate a particular vehicle code section or use particular jargon when explaining the unlawful activity he suspected; nor has he demonstrated that swerving into the opposite lane is not a violation of any law. precise words which an officer on the stand chooses to describe his state of mind at the scene people v. leyba (1981) 29 cal.3d 591, 597.) objectively, [citation.] (people v. letner and tobin (2010) 50 cal.4th 99, 145.) and regardless, a mistake as to which provision of law the defendant violated does not, by itself, render the suspicion unreasonable. (people v. smith (1984) 151 cal.app.3d 89, 98-99.) it follows that even if we were to agree tmistake as to the accepted jargon used to describe that provision would not have any effect on determining whether a suspicion was reasonable. defendant also contends that deputy carbajal could not have reasonably suspected a violation of section 21650, because the evidence supported an exception in that statute to the requirement of driving on the right-hand side of the street, 21650, subd. (e).) deputy carbajal u-turn was actually a three-point turn. he ambiguously testified that fetterly avenue was a two-lane -lane street. defendant argues that this testimony showed that his swerve came within the exception. as stated, we must view the evidence in the light most resolution of any conflicts in the testimony and 8 reasonable factual inferences. (people v. woods, supra, 21 cal.4th at p. 673.) the fact that a police cruiser of unknown size had to make a three-point turn instead of a u-turn does not compel the inference that the street was too narrow to keep to the right of center. deputy carbajal car as it was traveling north and the deputies were traveling south on the same street, and that he was able to notice the tint on the windows on both sides of the car. the trial court could reasonably infer that the street was a two-lane street, albeit unmarked, that it was wide enough to travel to the right of center, and that indeed, the two cars passed by one another. substantial evidence thus supported the trial conclusion that it was objectively reasonable to suspect that the swerve over the center of the street violated the law. iii. tinted windows defendant contends that the evidence did not support a finding that deputy carbajal could reasonably suspect that , as opposed to lawfully tinted windows. we have already concluded that deputy reasonable suspicion that defendant had violated the law, and thus justified the stop. nevertheless, we consider this contention, and find it to be without merit as well. the front driver and passenger side windows may be tinted so long as there remains a minimum light transmittance of 70 percent. ( 26708, subd. (d)(2).) a peace officer may stop a windows are illegally tinted. (people v. carter (2010) 182 cal.app.4th 522, 529; see people v. niebauer (1989) 214 cal.app.3d 1278, 1293, fn. 10.) defendant asserts that deputy carbajal did not articulate any reasonable basis 9 windows was illegal. defendant compares the facts of this case to those in people v. butler (1988) 202 cal.app.3d 602 (butler), where the appellate court found no facts in the record to suggest that the police officer had a reasonable suspicion that the rather than legally tinted, because the officer observed the car from a distance late at night and (id. at p. 606.) facts suggesting that the tinted glass is illegal, the detention rests upon the type of speculation which may not properly support an investigative stop. id. at p. 607.) defendant comparison with butler fails, as deputy carbajal did, in fact, articulate additional facts. as respondent observes, unlike the officer in butler, deputy carbajal testified that the windows were dark and appeared to be illegally tinted, and that he could not see inside the car. also unlike the officer in butler deputy carbajal saw don the same narrow street. (butler, supra, 202 cal.app.3d at pp. 606-607.) defendant argues that deputy carbajal inability to see inside the car we disagree. the inability to see through darkly tinted windows provided additional facts to support a finding that the suspicion of illegally tinted windows was objectively reasonable. (see people v. niebauer supra, 214 cal.app.3d at pp. 1292-1293, & fn. 10, [windows darker than normal and officer could see only outline of defendant through window]; cf. people v. roberts (2010) 184 cal.app.4th 1149, 1190-1191 [officer could not see through s tinted side window from the open passenger side window]; people v. hanes (1997) 60 cal.app.4th supp. 6, 10 10 [dark tint appeared black prevented officer from seeing front seat occupants as vehicle passed slowly in front of him].) defendant also contends that the windows were not in fact illegally tinted, and thus did not provide an objectively reasonable suspicion for a traffic stop. defendant contends that this was conclusively shown below with four defense photographs. the photographs depict a car with very dark window tint on the back side and rear windows, and tint on the front side windows which does not appear to be as dark. the photographs do not conclusively establish that the windows were not illegally tinted at the time of the stop, as they were all taken in daylight at an tially down. further, deputy carbajal recognized just one of them as depicting and he could not recall whether the , which was nearly six months before the hearing. the photographs thus do not establish or even provide substantial evidence that the light transmission of the front side windows was at least 70 percent. suggestion that if viewed -faith reasonable belief that something is illegal turns out, upon further investigation, to be legal, the stop violates the fourth amendment. the fourth amendment does not require that the officer conduct scientific tests to measure light transmittance prior to conducting a stop, of the light transmittance as if they were an expert witness on people v. niebauer, supra, 214 cal.app.3d at p. 1292.) he question . . . is not whether [defendantin fact in full compliance with the law at the time of the stop, but people v. saunders (2006) 38 cal.4th 1129, 1136.) 11 a traffic stop is lawful at its inception if it is based on a reasonable suspicion that any traffic violation has occurred, even if it is ultimately determined that no violation did occur. -- through investigation -- any ambiguity presented as to whether the brierton v. department of motor vehicles (2005) 130 cal.app.4th 499, 510.) not demand that the government be factually correct in its (saunders, supra, at p. 1136, quoting illinois v. rodriguez (1990) 497 u.s. 177, 184.) moreover, possibility of an innocent explanation does not deprive the officer of the capacity to entertain a reasonable suspicion of criminal conduct. indeed, the principal function of his investigation is to resolve that very ambiguity and establish whether the activity is in fact legal or illegal -- to enable the police to quickly determine whether they should allow the suspect to go about his business or hold him to answer charges. [citation. (people v. leyba, supra, 29 cal.3d at p. 599.) defendant contends that the stop cannot be justified as a mistake of fact or law, and he attempts to distinguish the recent decision by the united states supreme court extending the reasoning of fourth amendment precedents regarding reasonable mistakes of fact, to similarly reasonable mistakes of law. (see heien, supra, 135 s.ct. at pp. 536-538.) we need not consider mistake as a justification, as we have already found deputy carbajal articulated an objectively reasonable suspicion that two violations of law justified the stop. 12 disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. ____________________________, j. chavez we concur: __________________________, acting p. j. ashmann-gerst __________________________, j.* goodman ____________________________________________________________ * retired judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
