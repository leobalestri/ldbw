(a)(1)). allegations that he suffered two prior convictions for robbery and served a prior prison term were found true, and thus his sentence was subject to enhancements under the three strikes law ( 667, subds. (b)(j), 1170.12) and section 667.5, subdivision (b).2 on december 21, 2001, the trial court sentenced campos to 26 years to life. eleven years later campos petitioned the trial court to recall his sentence and hold a new sentencing hearing pursuant to section 1170.126, enacted as part of proposition 36. the trial court denied the petition, finding campos statutorily campos timely appealed. standard of review campos challenges the trial courproposition 36, and thus presents issues of statutory construction. (see people v. canty (2004) 32 cal.4th 1266, 1276 apply the same principles that govern the construction of a lee v. hanley (2015) 61 cal.4th 1225, 1232.) 1 undesignated statutory citations are to the penal code. the prohibition against possession of a firearm by a felon is now codified in section 29800. 2 campos also was convicted of a misdemeanor violation of the vehicle code that is not at issue in this appeal. 4 discussion prior to the enactment of proposition 36, a defendant who was convicted of a new felony would be subject to an indeterminate life sentence. (people v. yearwood (2013) 213 reserving the life sentence for cases where the current crime is a serious or violent felony or the prosecution has pled and proved an enumerated disqualifying factor. in all other cases, the (id. at pp. 167168; see  667, subd. (e)(2)(c), 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(c).) proposition 36 also provided that an inmate serving a third-strike sentence for a nonserious and nonviolent felony could petition for a reduction in his or her sentence. ( 1170.126, subds. (b), (e).) an inmate is statutorily ineligible for a sentence reduction, however, if the current offense is one of several specified controlled substance or sex offenses. ( 667, subd. (e)(2)(c)(ii), 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(c)(ii), 1170.126, subd. (e)(2).) an inmate is current offense, the defendant used a firearm, was armed with a firearm or deadly weapon, or intended to cause great bodily 1170.126, subd. (e)(2).) finally, an inmate is statutorily ineligible if he or she has suffered a prior conviction for certain enumerated felonies. ( 667, subd. (e)(2)(c)(iv), 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(c)(iv), 1170.126, subd. (e)(3).) here, the trial court found campos statutorily ineligible for a sentence reduction under section 667(e)(2)(c)(iii), because during the commission of his third-strike offense for possession 5 of judicially construed to mean having a firearm available for use, people v. osuna (2014) 225 cal.app.4th 1020, 1029 (osuna), disapproved on another ground by people v. frierson (2017) 4 cal.5th 225, 240, fn. 8.) campos does not dispute that at the time he committed his third-strike offense he had a firearm available for use. campos maintains, however, that to be statutorily ineligible under for use in furtherance of the commission of the offense that is the (italics omitted.) e separate, facilitates osuna, supra, 225 further or aid in the commission of the crime of possession of a firearm by a felon. in support, campos cites people v. bland (1995) 10 cal.4th 991 (bland), in which our supreme court interpreted the phrase armed with a firearm in the commission of a felony to require facilitative nexus enhancement under section 12022. (bland, at p. 1002.) in other armed with a firearm in the commission ibid.) because in this case being f the facilitate a separate offense, campos argues the trial court erred in finding him ineligible for sentence reduction. 6 as campos concedes, numerous appellate courts have rejected the argument that proposition 36 requires a facilitative nexus between the firearm and the current offense, and thus have held that defendants with third-strike convictions for firearm possession are ineligible for sentence reduction under proposition 36. (see, e.g., osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at pp. 10301032; people v. brimmer (2014) 230 cal.app.4th 782, 797799 (brimmer); people v. hicks (2014) 231 cal.app.4th 275, 283284 (hicks).) these cases note the distinction between an enhancement provision like sectioadditional term of imprisonment . . . for which a defendant cannot be punished until and unless convicted of a related additional punishment but reduces existing punishment. (osuna, at pp. 1030, 1032; see also brimmer, at p. 799; hicks, at pp. 283284.) thus, the prohibition against applying an people v. elder (2014) 227 cal.app.4th 1308, 1313 (elder), italics omitted), does not apply in the context of proposition 36, which reduces rather than enhances punishment. the cases further note that the arming enhancement in section 12022 applies when a defendant is armed with a firearm in a sentence ineligible for reduction if the inmate was armed with a [d]uring (osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1032; brimmer, supra, 230 cal.app.4th at pp. 798799; hicks, supra, 231 cal.app.4th at pp. 283284; see  667, subd. (e)(2)(c)(iii), 1170.12, subd. 7 [only] a temporal nexus between the arming and the underlying osuna, at p. 1032; see also brimmer, at pp. 798799; hicks, at p. 284.) campos argues these cases fail to explain why the phrase grammatically interchangeable, and there is no reason to assume the bland, the commduring the underlying facilitative nexus(bland, supra, 10 cal.4th at p. 1002.) in other words, the phrase both a temporal nexus and a to denote the temporal nexus only. (see osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1032 [quoting bland for the proposition occur during underlying crime and that it have facilitative nexus campos argues that in other contexts, such as the enhancement under section 12022.7 for infliction of great bodily temporal relationship, not a facilitative one. campos contends sound basis for distinction bet 8 the cases cited by campos discussing section 12022.7 do not address the distinction between temporal and facilitative nexus, and thus do not shed light on the issue before us. (see people v. poroj (2010) 190 cal.app.4th 165, 168 [section 12022.7, subdivision (a) does not impose an intent requirement beyond the intent required to commit the underlying felony]; people v. valdez (2010) 189 cal.app.4th 82, 84 [section 12022.7 enhancement does not apply to conviction for fleeing the scene of an injury accident when injuries were caused by the non-felonious accident, not the fleeing]). regardless, as we have discussed, the supreme bland makes clear that for purposes of penal code provisions based on defendants arming themselves (bland, supra, 10 cal.4th at p. 1002.) campos argues that had voters intended to make firearm possession crimes ineligible for sentence reduction, they would have included them in the list of specific ineligible offenses rather as we have explained, campos is construed to require a facilitative nexus, and indeed bland compels the opposite conclusion. thus, to the extent campos is we must disagree. (see people v. weidert (1985) 39 cal.3d 836, 845here the language of a statute uses terms that have technical sense which had been placed upon them by the courts. 9 we further conclude that it was not exclude categorically all firearm possession offenses from relief under proposition 36, which is further explanation for why those crimes are not listed among the enumerated ineligible offenses. the penal cfelons applies not only to felons who have actual possession of a receives, or has in possession or under custody or control any  29800, subd. (a)(1).) thus, a defendant may be convicted under this provision based on constructive possession, that is, when the defendant does not have immediate possession his dominion (osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1029.) for example, a felon who purchased a firearm, but had not yet taken physical possession of it, would be in violation of the statute without ever being armed with a firearm. (see osunaa firearm does not necessarily constitute being armed with a limited the ineligibility of firearm possession crimes under proposition 36 only to those in which the defendant posed a danger by having actual possession of a firearm. (see elder, supradangerous felons did not benefit from any of the amendments and remained campos disputes that felons in possession of firearms are the sort of dangerous criminal voters intended to exclude from weapon readily available for use generally does not render a 10 that people do weapon only becomes dangerous when it might facilitate a the court in elder rejected this adefendant asserts, possession of a gun of itself is not criminal, a possession of a gun is not a crime that is merely malum prohibitum. generally abhors even momentary possession of guns by convicted felons who, the legislature has found, are more likely to misuse commitments for unlawful gun possession come within our interpretation of this eligibility criterion, it would not run afoul of elder, supra, 227 cal.app.4th at p. 1314.) we agree, and similarly conclude that interpreting sections 667, subdivision (e)(2)(c)(iii) and 1170.12, subdivision (c)(2)(c)(iii) to render firearm possession crimes ineligible for relief, at least insofar as when the offender is in actual possession of the 11 disposition the order denying the petition for recall and resentencing is affirmed. not to be published. bendix, j. we concur: johnson, acting p. j. weingart, j.* * judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
