(see pen. code,  667.5, subd. (b) (section 667.5(b)).) in a prior appeal (people v. ramos (sept. 10, 2014, b250000 [nonpub. opn.]), we reversed the convicted of a serious felony, vacated the sentence and affirmed the judgment in all other respects. before remittitur issued, voters enacted proposition 47, using the procedures set forth in proposition 47, ramos successfully petitioned to have the six felony convictions underlying his section 667.5(b) enhancements designated as misdemeanors. (see pen. code,  1170.18, subds. (f) & (g).) at the resentencing on robbery conviction, the defendant argued that the trial court should strike his section 667.5(b) enhancements because the underlying offenses had now been designated misdemeanors. the trial court, however, concluded that our disposition in the prior appeal precluded it from providing such relief at resentencing, and advised ramos to raise the issue through a writ petition. ramos thereafter filed a writ of coram nobis requesting that the court strike the six section 667.5(b) enhancements. the court granted the petition. the district attorney now appeals the order, arguing that: (1) ramos was not eligible for coram nobis relief; (2) the trial court erred in concluding that a prior felony conviction that has been designated a misdemeanor under proposition 47 cannot support a section 667.5(b) enhancement; and (3) even if a section 667.5(b) enhancement cannot be predicated on a prior felony that has been designated a misdemeanor, that rule does not apply here based on principles of retroactivity. we affirm. 3 factual background a. nviction and prior appeal in december of 2012, the district attorney for the county of los angeles filed an information alleging defendant cesar ramos robbed a convenience store. the information included a on a 1979 robbery conviction that had occurred in illinois. it also alleged ramos had suffered eight additional prior felony convictions that resulted in a term of imprisonment. the jury found ramos guilty of robbery. in a bifurcated proceeding, the trial court found that the records pertaining to illinois robbery conviction proved he had suffered a prior serious felonyconviction under both the three strikes law (see pen. code,  667, subds. (b)-(i), 1170.12, subds. (a)-(d)),1 and the prior serious felony enhancement set forth in section 667, subdivision (a)(1). the court also found the prosecution had proven ramos suffered six additional [b]. based on these findings, the court sentenced ramos to an aggregate term of 21 years in prison: (1) the high term of five years in prison on the robbery conviction, doubled to ten years based on his prior strike; (2) a five-year enhancement for his prior conviction ( 667, subd. (a)(1)); and (3) six one-year terms for each of his prior prison term convictions. ( 667.5, subd. (b).) ramos appealed his conviction, arguing that (1) [an] s identification testimony was improperly admittedthe evidence was insufficient that [his] prior illinois robbery conviction qualified as a serious felony under california law. on the first issue, we concluded that the court had erred in permitting the identification testimony, but found the error harmless. on the second issue, we found insufficient to prove it constituted a serious felony under the three strikes law ( 667, subds. (b)-(i), 1170.12, subds. (a)-(d)) and section 667, subdivision (a)(1).we clarified, however, that on remand, the people 1 unless otherwise noted, all further statutory citations are to the penal code. 4 were permitted to present additional evidence establishing the illinois conviction was in fact a serious felony under california law. our disposition directed as follows: he true findings as to the allegations ts 1979 illinois robbery conviction is a conviction for a serious felony within the meaning of the three strikes law and section 667, subdivision s sentence is vacated. in all other respects the judgment is affirmed. the matter is remanded for future proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. b. remand proceedings before our remittitur issued, voters enacted proposition 47, which became effective november 5, 2014. (see people v. riviera (2015) 233 cal.app.4th 1085, 1089 (riviera).) pursuant to newly-added sentencing procedures, ramos filed petitions requesting that the trial court designate each of the prior felony convictions underlying the six section 667.5(b) enhancements at issue in his robbery case as misdemeanors. (see  1170.18, subs. (f), (g).) on february 27, 2015 and march 9, 2015, the trial court issued orders granting the petitions. on april 15, 2015, the trial court held a resentencing hearing on conviction. the district attorney informed the court that it did not intend to submit any further evidence demonstrating that 1979 illinois robbery conviction qualified as a serious felony under california law. court announced that it intended to strike the prior strike allegation and the prior serious felony conviction enhancement ( 667(a)), thereby reducing defense counsel, however, argued that the trial court should also strike six section 667.5(b) enhancements because each of the underlying felony convictions had now been designated as misdemeanors pursuant to proposition 47. as articulated by in order to qualify as a 667.5(b) prior, the conviction must be a felony. as a result of the granting of the petitions [under 5 proposition 47], the convictions now are misdemeanors for all purposes.is no felony conviction . . . that 667.5 could rest concluded, however, that the language of our disposition in case no. b250000 only permitted the court to address the portion of sentence that was predicated on the prior serious felony finding. defense counsel disagreed, arguing that thereby enabling the court to revisit every aspect of his sentence, including the imposition of the section 667.5(b) enhancements. the court rejected the argument, ruling that our disposition indicated [had been] affirmed in its entirety except . . . on those . . . issues [related to] the illinois robbery conviction the court instructed ramos that the procedure for [challenging the section 667.5(b) enhancements] . . . would be some sort of a writ. . . . you are most likely right on th[e merits of the] issue. but at this point . . . the court of appeal affirmed. you file the court then resentenced the defendant to five years in prison for the robbery conviction, and six additional years for the six section 667.5(b) enhancements.2 approximately one month after the resentencing, ramos that sought ct[ing] the true findings as to the six prior terms within the meaning of penal code section 667.5(b) and resentenc[ing] the district attorney opposed the motion, arguing there were two reasons the sdemeanor under proposition 47 did not affect [the application of a section 667.5(b)first, the district attorney argued that a section 667.5(b) enhancement is primarily 2 as discussed in more detail below (post at pp. 20-21), the trial court erred in cprecluded the court from considering the applicability of the section 667.5(b) enhancements at resentencing. (see, e.g., people v. nesbitt (2010) 191 cal.app.4th 227, 244, fn.18 (nesbitt) [when case is remanded for resentencing, the trial court is authorized to reconsider all aspects of the sentence].) 6 intended to [prior] prison term, not . . . the nature of the prior offense. the district attorney contended that in light of this intent, a section 667.5(b) enhancement should be applied whenever a defendant has completed a prison term on a prior offense. second, the district attorney argued that the language of section 667.5(b) did not require that the underlying offense remain [a] felony . . . for all time; the statute only required proof that the defendant had previously been convicted of a felony that resulted in a term of imprisonment. the district attorney reasoned that because ramos had in fact been convicted of six prior felonies that resulted in terms of imprisonment, it was immaterial that the offenses were subsequently designated misdemeanors. the court granted the writ, concluding that a section 667.5(b) enhancement could not be predicated on a felony conviction that had been designated as a misdemeanor under proposition 47. on prior enhancements under penal code section 667.5(b) . . . ordered reduced . . . accord[ingly]. the district attorney filed a motion for reconsideration arguing for the first time that the defendant had failed to satisfy the elements necessary to obtain relief under the m nobis. specifically, the district attorney argued ramos had failed to fact existed . . . which, without any fault . . . on his part, was not presented to the court at the trial on the merits, and which if presented would have prevented the rendition of the judgment.

(see people v. ibanez (1999) 76 cal.app.4th 537, 544 (ibanez) [order granting s petition for a writ of coram nobis after im after judgment under  1238, subd. (a)(5)].) discussion a. we construe ramosa petition for writ of habeas corpus the district attorney initially argues without addressing the merits of the underlying sentencing issue because the claim ramos raised in his petition is not a valid ground for coram nobis relief. the writ of error coram nobis is a nonstatutory, common law remedy(people v. kim (2009) 45 cal.4th 1078, 1096 (kim) that rrors or s attention. [citation.] will properly issue only when the petitioner can establish three elements: (1) that some fact existed which, without his fault or negligence, was not represented to the court at the trial and which would have prevented the rendition of the judgment; (2) that the new evidence does not go to the merits of the issues of fact determined at trial; and (3) that he did not know nor could he have, with due diligence, discovered the facts upon which he relies any sooner than the point at which he petitions for the writ. the writ lies to correct only errors of fact as distinguished from errors of law. [citation.] (ibanez, supra, 76 cal.app.4th at p. 544; see also kim, supra, 45 cal.4th at p. 1096 [summarizing the elements of the writ and clarifying that the to correct errors moreover, the allegedly new fact [on which the petition is based] must have been unknown and must have been in existence at the time of the judgment.kim, supra, 45 cal.4th at p. 1093.) those principles demonstrate that a petition for a writ of coram nobis was not the appropriate mechanism to obtain the relief ramos was seeking. rather, the issue raised a question of law: whether the trial court was required to strike his section 667.5(b) enhancements based on the proposition 47 orders designating the 8 underlying prior felony offenses as misdemeanors. moreover, the fact at issue the redesignation of his underlying prior offenseswas not unknown to the trial court at the time of the resentencing. indeed, the parties discussed that fact at length during the sentencing hearing. ramos, however, argues that if coram nobis is not an appropriate remedy for the type of claim he raised in his petition (which it is not), we should construe the petition as one seeking a writ of habeas corpusa court has authority to treat one type of writ cox v. superior court of amador county (2016) 1 cal.app.5th 855, 859; see also people v. picklesimer (2010) 48 cal.4th 330, 340-341 (picklesimer) [the label given a petition, action or other pleading is not determinativetrue nature of a petition or cause of action is based on the facts alleged and remedy sought in that pleading.

[citationabdallah, supra, 246 cal.app.4th at p. 742) proposition 47makes certain drug- and theft-related offenses misdemeanors, unless the offenses were committed by certain ineligible defendants. these offenses had previously been designated as either felonies (riviera, supra, 233 cal.app.4th at p. 1089.) proposition 47 also created section 1170.18, which establishes a mechanism for resentencing and reclassifying felony convictions for offenses that are now misdemeanors under the initiative. under section 1170.18, subdivision (a), sentence for an offense that is now a misdemeanor under proposition 47, may petition for a recall of that sentence and request resentencing in accordance with the statutes that were added or amended by proposition 47. a person who satisfies the criteria in section . . . unless the court, in its discretion, determines that resentencing the petitioner would pose ( 1170.18, subd.

(f).) subdivision (k), in turn, provides that conviction that is recalled and resentenced under subdivision (b) or designated as a misdemeanor under subdivision (g) shall be considered a misdemeanor for all purposes, except that such resentencing shall not permit that person to own, possess, or have in his or her custody or control any firearm or prevent his or her conviction [for various firearm prohibitions b. summary of people v. abdallah (2016) 246 cal.app.4th 736 in abdallah, supra, 6 cal.app.4th 736, this court considered a similar issue regarding the effect of a proposition 47 reclassification on a prior prison term 12 enhancement. the defendant in abdallah was charged with several felony counts, including possession of methamphetamine while armed with a firearm (health & saf. code,  11370.1) the information included a special allegation under section 667.5(b) asserting that the defendant had served a term of imprisonment for a prior felony conviction in 2002, and was then convicted of a second felony in 2011 (resulting in a suspended sentence) that he had committed within five years of completing his term on the 2002 conviction. in june of 2014, a jury convicted the defendant of the offenses charged in the information. prior to sentencing, he obtained an order under proposition 47 recalling his 2011 felony conviction, and reclassifying it as a misdemeanor. at sentencing, the trial court imposed a one-year enhancement under section 667.5(b), concluding that the prosecution had established the defendant had served a prior prison term for a felony conviction (the 2002 conviction), and then committed a second felony within five years of his completion of that prison term (the 2011 conviction). on appeal, the defendant argued that the section 667.5(b) enhancement was invalid more specifically, he argued that because his 2011 felony conviction had been reclassified as a misdemeanor under proposition 47, he had not committed a felony conviction within five years of completing his prison term for the 2002 felony conviction. the attorney general, however, argued that the proposition 47 reclassification had no effect on the section 667.5(b) enhancement because the 2011 conviction was a felony at the time he had committed the offense. as stated by the attorney general, the reclassification fact [that the defendant] committed a felony offense less than five years after his release from custody for a prior felony. (abdallah, supra, 246 cal.app.4th at p. 743.) in our analysis, we explained that language of section 1170.18, subdivision (k), from section 17, subdivision (b), which describes the effect of a judicial declaration that a wobbler offense is a misdemeanor. (see  17, subd. (b) [where a criit is a misdemeanor for all purposes . . . [w]hen . . . the court declares the o 13 (abdallah, supra, 246 cal.app.4th at p. 745.) we further explained that in people v. park (2013) 56 cal.4th 782 (park), the supreme court had for all e in reversing a enhancement (see  667, subd. (a)) that the trial court had imposed based on an offense that another court had previously declared to be a misdemeanor under section 17(b). the supreme court held that when the court in the prior proceeding properly exercised its discretion by reducing the [felony] conviction to a misdemeanor, that offense no longer qualified as a prior serious felony within the meaning of section 667, subdivision (a), and could not be used, under that provision, t [citation.] the court observed that . . . reduction of a wobbler to a misdemeanor under . . . section 17(b) generally precludes its use as a prior felony convicti (abdallah, supra, 246 cal.app.4th at pp. 745-746 [citing and quoting park, supra, 56 cal.4th at p. 794].) we concluded that the same logic applies to sections 667.5, subdivision (b), and 1170.18, subdivision (k). [the fourth requirement of] [s]ection 667.5, subdivision (b) excludes from the prior prison term enhancement a defendant who has neither committed an offense which [a prison term] within five years of release on parole or official discharge from another felony conviction s incarceration. once the trial court recalled ] 2011 felony sentence and resentenced him to a misdemeanor, section 1170.18, subdivision (k), reclassified th [citation.] therefore, at the time of sentencing in this case, [the defendant] was not a an offense which result[ed] in a felony within five years after his release on parole for his prior conviction. [citations.] thus, the trial court erred by imposing the one-year sentence enhancement under section 667.5, subdivision (b).abdallah, supra, 246 cal.app.4th at p. 746.) our decision also addressed several arguments the attorney general had raised in support of its assertion that the reclassification his prior prison term enhancement. first, the attorney general contended that 14 abdallah, supra, 246 cal.app.4th at p. 746.) according to the attorney general, because the defendant had committed a felony offense of his release on . . . the 2002 conviction, . . . the fact that the subsequent offense [wa]s no longer a felony [wa]s inconsequential. (ibid.) we rejected the argument, explaining that the case did involve a retroactive application of proposition 47: trial court did not use 2011 conviction as if it were a felony conviction for purposes of imposing the prior prison term enhancement until after the court had recalled 2011 sentence and resentenced him under proposition 47. the court did not reach back in time to resentence [the defendant] in the current case based on the redesignation of a predicate offense under section 1170.18, subdivision (f), for the prior prison term enhancement. (id. at p. 747.)4 the attorney general also argued that park contained language indicating that an enhancement predicated on a prior felony conviction does apply when case) the prior offense was reduced to a misdemeanor after the defendanton the current offense, but before his sentencing. in support, it cited the following passage from park: . . . defendant would be subject to the [section 667, subdivision (a)] enhancement [for a prior serious felony conviction] had he committed and been convicted of the present crimes before the court reduced the earlier offense to a 4 reclassified as a misdemeanor prior to his sentencing on his current offense distinguished holding that proposition 47 does not apply retroactively to redesignate predicate offenses as misdemeanors for purposes of imposing sentencing enhancements where the original sentence was imposed before the enactment of proposition 47 (abdallah, supra, 246 cal.app.4th at p. 746.) since we decided abdallahreferred to in our opinion. (see people v. carrea, review granted april 27, 2016, s233011; people v. williams, review granted may 11, 2016, s233559, people v. ruff, review granted may 11, 2016, s233201; see also people v. valenzuela, review granted march 30, 2016, s232900 (lead case).) the court has also granted review in at least one additional case involving retroactivity that was decided after abdallah. (see people v. jones (2016) 1 cal.app.5th 221, 229, review granted sept. 14, 2016, s235901.) 15 (park, supra, 56 cal.4th at p. 802.) in rejecting the argument, we explained that the attorney general fail[ed] to recognize that the applicability of the section 667[a] enhancement in park turns on the status of the prior offense at the time of conviction; it imposes a five-convicted of a serious has previously suffered a serious felony conviction. in contrast, the enhancement in this case, section 667.5, subdivision (b), depends on the status of the prior offense at the time of sentencing; it imposes a one-year enhancthe new offense is any felony for which a prison sentence . . . is imposed. . . . (abdallah, supra, 246 cal.app.4th at p. 748, fn. 8.) finally, the attorney general argued that the one-year prior prison term sentence enhancement applie[d] [to the defendant] because the enhancement is based on a des recidivist status, and not on the specific underlying conduct. (abdallah, supra, 246 cal.app.4th at p. 748.) we concluded, however, park [had] rejected a similar argument in the context of wobblers and section 667, subdivision (a). (ibid.) in park, the attorney general had argued that a section 667(a) enhancement should apply even when the prior offense was subsequently reduced to a misdemeanor because the [cpark, supra, 56 cal.4th at p. 802.) the supreme court disagreed, explaining that [w]hen the court properly exercises its discretion to reduce a wobbler to a misdemeanor, it has found that the felony punishment, and its consequences, are not appropriate [citation.] c reasons for reducis that under such circumstances the offense is not considered to be serious enough to entitle the court to resort to it as a prior conviction of a felony for the purpose of increasing the penalty for [citation.] (abdallah, supra, 246 cal.app.4th at p. 748 [citing and quoting park, supra, 56 cal.4th at pp. 801, 794].) we concluded that the same reasoning applied to prior felonies that had subsequently been reclassified as misdemeanors under proposition 47. 16 2. section 667.5(b) does not apply to a prior felony conviction that has been designated a misdemeanor under proposition 47 prior to sentencing on the current offense the primary issue in this case is closely related to the question we addressed in abdallah. as explained above, section 667.5was previously convicted of a felony; (2) was imprisoned as a result of that conviction; (3) completed that term of imprisonment; and (4) did not remain free for five years of both prison custody and the commission of a new offense resulting in a felony (abdallah, supra, 246 cal.app.4th at p. 742.) abdallah analyzed how the reclassification of a felony conviction that occurred within five years of a prior felony conviction affects the fourth requirement of a section 667.5(b) enhancement. this case, in contrast, requires us to determine how a proposition 47 redesignation affects the first requirement. specifically, we must determine whether a section 667.5(b) enhancement applies when a prior felony conviction that resulted in a prison term has been designated a misdemeanor under proposition 47. our reasoning in abdallah compels the conclusion that a prior felony conviction that resulted in a prison term does not support a section 667.5(b) enhancement when the offense has been designated a misdemeanor under proposition 47 prior to sentencing on the current offense. as summarized above, abdallah held that once a trial court has reclassified a prior felony offense to be a misdemeanor, section 1170.18, subdivision (k), requires that, from that point forward, the offense must be treated as a misdemeanor for all purposes. abdallah further held that this for included determinations regarding the section 667.5(b) enhancement. thus, under abdallah, when a prior felony conviction that resulted in a prison term has been designated a misdemeanor prior to sentencing on the current offense, the defendant is not eligible for a section 667.5(b) because he is no longer a person who has been convicted of a prior felony.5 5 recalled and he was resentenced under 17 the district attorney disagrees, asserting that when a defendant has completed a prison term for a prior felony conviction, section 667.5(b) applies even if the offense is subsequently designated a misdemeanor. as discussed in more detail below, however, each of the arguments the district attorney raises in support of its position are foreclosed by our analysis in abdallah. first, the district attorney argues that because section 667.5(b) is primarily recidivismshould apply whenever a defendant has been convicted of an offense for which he served a prison term; the fact that the offense is later designated a misdemeanor is immaterial. in people v. prather (1990) 50 cal.3d 428 (prather), our supreme court reached a underlying purpose[] of [the enhancement] . . . [is] to provide increased terms of imprisonment for recidivist felony offenders. [citation.] []. . . . we think it clear that 667.5(b) is aimed primarily at the underlying felony conviction, and only secondarily, id. at p. 440; see also jones, supra, 5 cal.4th at pp. 1148-1149 [quoting and applying language in prather6].) we also considered and rejected this same argument in abdallah. (see felony convictions, in contrast, were designated misdemeanors under section 1170.18 subdivision (g), which applies to persons who have completed felony sentences for offenses that would now be misdemeanors under proposition 47. for purposes of our analysis, however, this distinction is immaterial because section 1170.18, subdivision (k) (b) or designated as a misdemeanor under subdivision (g) shall be considered a misdemeanor for all purposes. 6 the district attorney contends that in people v. baird (1995) 12 cal.4th 126, the court implicitly rejected its prior holding in pratherthe following language from bairdprior conviction to increase the sentence for [possession of a firearm after having been convicted of a felony]. rather, section 667.5(b) authorizes additional punishment only if the additional factor of prison incarceration for the prior conviction is established. [] 18 abdallah, supra, 246 cal.app.4th at p. 748.) moreover, whatever its intended purpose, the language of section 667.5(b) makes clear that the enhancement applies only when the prior offense was a felony. (tenner, supra, 6 cal.4th at p. 563 [section felony. . . .abdallah, supra, 246 cal.app.4th at p. 742.) as explained by our supreme court, the section imposes an enhancement for a that were deemed serious enough . . . to warrant actual imprisonment.(prather, supra, 50 cal.3d at p. 440.) when a prior felony conviction has been designated a misdemeanor under proposition 47, the prior offense no longer qualifies as a felony conviction, rendering section 667.5(b) inapplicable. second, the district attorney argues that the text of section 667.5(b) demonstrates that the enhancement applies whenever a defendant has previously been convicted of a felony for which he completed a prison termprior conviction currently in other words, the district attorney contends that redesignating a felony to a misdemeanor under proposition 47 does not change the fact that the defendant was actually convicted of a felony for which he served a term of imprisonment. the attorney general raised this same argument in abdallah, contending that reclassifying a felony to a misdemeanor did not affect the fourth requirement of section 667.5(b) because the defendant had [still] committed a felony offense less than five years after his release from custody for a prior felony. (see abdallah, supra, at p. 743.) as we determined in abdallah, however, for . . . for such felony is obvious. a prior felony conviction could well have resulted in something less than confinement in the state prison, in which event no enhancement id. at p. 132.) this language does not conflict with conclusion that section 667.5(b) is primarily intended to punish the underlying felony, rather than the prior prison term. instead, the cited passage merely clarifies that the fact of a prior felony conviction is, standing alone, insufficient to warrant a section 667.5(b) enhancement. 19 section 1170.18, subdivision (k) requires that after a redesignation, the offense must be treated as a misdemeanor even if it was a felony at the time of the conviction.7 third, the district attorney argues that we should construe for determining whether a prior offense qualifies as a felony conviction within the meaning of section 667.5(b) as . . . the new offense [was committed],rather than the thus, according to the district attorneyoffenses were still felonies at the time he committed his current offense for robbery, section 667.5(b) applies even though the prior offenses were designated misdemeanors prior to his resentencing on the current offense. in abdallah, however, we rejected an essentially identical argument, concluding the enhancement in . . . section 667.5, subdivision (b), depends on the status of the prior offense at the time of sentencing [on the new offense]; it imposes a one-the new offense is any felony for which a prison sentence . . . is imposed. . . . (abdallah, supra, 246 cal.app.4th at p. 748.)8 7 the supreme court also rejected an essentially identical argument in park. in that case, the attorney general argued that the language of section 667(a) made clear that a five-year enhancement was to be added to the sentence of andefendant had pleaded guilty to his prior offense, his conviction was a felony and remained so until the trial court reduced it to a misdemeanor three years later. thus, according to the attorney general, the enhancement applied because the defendant had actually been convicted of a serious felony; the fact that the offense was subsequently designated a misdemeanor was immaterial. the supreme court disagreed, explaining s interpretation, section 667(a) would override section s exercise of discretion in reducing a wobbler to a misdemeanor renders the offense a park, supra, 56 cal.4th interpretation of the relevant statues, section 667.5(b) would override section 8 the primary authority the district attorney cites in support of her assertion that people v. weeks (2014) 224 cal.app.4th 1045. weeks, however, was decided before the passage of proposition 47, and addressed a significantly different issue: 20 finally, the district attorney argues that even if a prior felony conviction that has been designated a misdemeanor under proposition 47 cannot support a section 667.5(b) enhancement, that rule does not apply here based on principles of retroactivity. the district attorney contends that unlike in abdallah, ramos was originally sentenced on his current offense before the prior felony convictions underlying his section 667.5(b) enhancements were designated as misdemeanors. the district attorney argues that in light of this distinguishing fact, ramos must show that proposition 47 was intended to apply retroactively, allowing petitioners to challenge sentence enhancements that were imposed before the underlying offenses were designated misdemeanors. the procedural history of this case demonstrates, however, that ramos did in fact have his prior felony convictions designated as misdemeanors prior to the operative sentencing hearing on his current offense. although it is true that ramos was initially sentenced on the current offense before proposition 47our prior decision in case no. b250000 reversed a true finding that he had previously been convicted of a serious felony, vacated his sentence and remanded the matter for further proceedings. at the resentencing hearing, held after ramos had obtained his proposition 47 redesignation orders, the trial court concluded it had no authority to strike the section 667.5(b) whether a section 667.5(b) enhancement applies when the defendant was still serving his term of imprisonment on the prior felony offense at the time he committed the current offense. the attorney general argued that the enhancement was appropriate because the prison prior to be trid. at pp. 1049-1050.) the appellate etermining whether a previously meanifor(id. at p. 1051.) weeks er a prior off-imposed requirement that a re-designated 21 enhancements because our opinion had not specifically addressed them. it further concluded that in light of the limited nature of our remand, the section 667.5(b) issue could only be raised by way of a writ. findings, however, our disposition contained no language indicating that the only sentencing issue the court could consider on remand was the true finding on the prior serious felony conviction. instead, the disposition matter for further proceedings. it is well-established hen a case is remanded for resentencing by an appellate court, the trial court is entitled to consider the entire sentencing scheme. not limited to merely striking illegal portions, the trial court may reconsider all sentencing choices.
