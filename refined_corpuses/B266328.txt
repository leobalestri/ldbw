filed 11/21/16 p. v. garcia ca2/2 not to be published in the official reports california rules of court, rule 8.1115(a), prohibits courts and parties from citing or relying on opinions not certified for publication or ordered published, except as specified by rule 8.1115(b). this opinion has not been certified for publication or ordered published for purposes of rule 8.1115. in the court of appeal of the state of california second appellate district division two the people, plaintiff and respondent, v. isaac garcia, defendant and appellant. b266328 (los angeles county super. ct. no. va128373) appeal from a judgment of the superior court of los angeles county. john a. torribio, judge. affirmed, as modified. janet j. gray, under appointment by the court of appeal, for defendant and appellant. kamala d. harris, attorney general, gerald a. engler, chief assistant attorney general, lance e. winters, senior assistant attorney general, yun k. lee and thomas c. hsieh, deputy attorneys general, for plaintiff and respondent. * * * * * * 2 isaac garcia (defendant) appeals his convictions for two counts of attempted premeditated murder and one count of robbery. he argues that there is insufficient evidence to support the attempted murder counts and that the trial court mis-instructed on those counts; he further argues that there is insufficient evidence to support the gang allegation or the finding, as to the attempted murders, that he personally inflicted great bodily injury. we conclude the convictions and gang enhancement on the attempted murders are sound, but vacate the gang enhancement on the robbery count and the finding on the attempted murder counts that he personally inflicted great bodily injury. his sentence must accordingly be modified to 65 years to life in prison. facts and procedural background i. facts defendant, israel itehua (itehua) and jeremy harris (harris) are all members of the bellflower devils clique of the 18th street gang. in november 2012, the three men saw a man they thought was a rival followed him into an apartment complex. as they approached the complex, itehua pulled out a gun. their quarry ran into an apartment, and two women standing outside that apartment told defendant told one of the wom then punched her in the face. seconds later, itehua shot the other woman in the neck, paralyzing her from the chest down. the three then turned to run away. as they left the complex, itehua fired four shots into a homeless man who had earlier refused to state any gang affiliation. a month later, defendant walked into a rite aid, stuffed a bottle of alcohol beneath his sweatshirt, walked out the door without paying for it and punched the female loss prevention officer who tried to stop him. 3 ii. procedural history the people charged defendant with (1) the attempted murder of the woman itehua shot (pen. code,  187, subd. (a) & 6641), (2) the attempted murder of the homeless man ( 187, subd. (a) & 664), and (3) robbery ( 211).2 the people further alleged that all three crimes were committed for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with a criminal street gang ( 186.22); that both attempted murders were committed willfully, deliberately and with premeditation ( 664, subd. (a)); that a principal discharged a firearm in the course of each attempted murder ( 12022.53, subd. (d)); and that defendant personally inflicted great bodily injury in the course of each attempted murder ( 12022.7, subd. (b)). a jury convicted defendant of all three crimes and found all further allegations to be true. the trial court sentenced defendant to a prison term of 68 years and four months to life. the court imposed a sentence of 32 years to life for each attempted murder, comprised of 7 years to life for the attempted murder plus 25 years for the discharge of a firearm allegation. the court imposed a sentence of four years and four months for the robbery, compromised of one year for the robbery (one-third the midterm of three years) plus three years and four months for the gang allegation (one-third the 10-year enhancement for that allegation). the court ran all three terms consecutively. defendant filed a timely appeal. discussion i. attempted murder convictions the trial court instructed the jury that it could convict defendant of the attempted murders committed by itehua if it found that (1) defendant had aided and abetted itehua and harris in committing the crimes of battery or disturbing the peace (by approaching the rival gang member), and (2) the 1 all further statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise indicated. 2 itehua and harris were also charged with the two attempted murders. people v. itehua (june 30, 2016, b265575) [nonpub. opn.].) 4 attempted murders were a natural and probable consequence of those crimes. on appeal, defendant argues that his attempted murder convictions are defective because (1) there is insufficient evidence that the attempted murder of the woman and the homeless man were a natural and probable consequence of committing battery or disturbing the peace against the rival gang member, (2) the trial court erred in instructing the jury it could find attempted murder to be a natural and probable consequence of those lesser crimes, (3) the trial court erred in not requiring the jury to find that defendant personally acted with premeditation, which violates people v. chiu (2014) 59 cal.4th 155 (chiu) and precludes the imposition a life sentence under apprendi v. new jersey (2000) 530 u.s. 466 (apprendi), and (4) the trial court erred in rethe standard instruction on the natural and probable consequences doctrine. a. sufficiency of the evidence a person is liable for a crime if he commits the crime himself or if he aids and abets another in its commission. ( 31.) a person is liable as an , (2) he, by his act or advice, aids, promotes, encourages or instigates the actual , and (3) he acts with the intent or commission of the crime. (people v. mccoy (2001) 25 cal.4th 1111, 1118; people v. prettyman (1996) 14 cal.4th 248, 259 (prettyman); people v. beeman (1984) 35 cal.3d 547, 561.) when a person aids and abets a crime, he must have the same intent as the actual perpetrator. (mccoy, at p. 1118 & fn. 1; people v. nguyen (2015) 61 cal.4th 1015, 1054.) an aider and abettor is guilty not only of the crime he intends to aid of any other crime the perpetrator actually commits . . . that is a natural and probable consequences of the intended people v. rangel (2016) 62 cal.4th 1192, 1228-1229 (rangel); prettyman, supra, 14 cal.4th at p. 254.) before criminal liability will attach for a further crime beyond the intended crime, the people must prove (1) that the defendant aided and abetted the intended crime, and (2) the further natural and probable consequence of the [intended crime] that prettyman, at pp. 261-262.) in assessing 5 the second element, courts ask: would a reasonable person in the foreseeable consequence of the crime the defendant intended to aid and abet? (chiu, supra, 59 cal.4th at p. 165; people v. medina (2009) 46 cal.4th 913, 920 (medina); people v. gonzales (2001) 87 cal.app.4th 1, 9-10; people v. woods (1992) 8 cal.app.4th 1570, 1587.) for these purposes, it is enough possible consequence which might reasonably have been contemplated.medina, at p. 920.) the need not have been a strong probability. (ibid.) under these standards, it does not whether the aider and abettor actually [subjectively] foresaw the [further] crime.ibid.; gonzales, at p. 9.) defendant argues that there is insufficient evidence that a reasonable person in his situation would recognize that the attempted murder of a bystander (such as the woman outside the apartment or the homeless man) might be a natural and probable consequence of a battery or confrontation that disturbs the peace against a rival gang member. in evaluating this sufficiency challenge, namely, evidence that is reasonable, credible and of solid valueto support people v. banks (2014) 59 cal.4th 1113, 1156 (banks), overruled on other grounds by people v. scott (2015) 61 cal.4th 363, 391.) in and draw all reasonable inferences to support that finding. (ibid.) we conclude that the evidence was sufficwere a natural and probable consequence of the confrontation with the rival gang member that defendant intended to aid and abetexpert ho . . . such defiance. defendant and his cohorts did precisely that. defendant himself did not hesitate before confronting, cussing out, and punching one of the two women outside the apartment when, as he later explained, she edren were inside the apartment, and itehua did not hesitate before shooting the other woman or shooting the homeless man who refused to respond to their gang 6 challenge. iwould foresee that murder is a natural and probable consequence of a gang-related assault or fistfight. (e.g, medina, supra, 46 cal.4th at p. 922 [so holding]; people v. olguin (1994) 31 cal.app.4th 1355, 1376 (olguin) [same]; people v. godinez (1992) 2 cal.app.4th 492, 499-500 (godinez) [same]; people v. montano (1979) 96 cal.app.3d 221, 226-227 (montano) [same]; see generally people v. ayala (2010) 181 cal.app.4th 1440, 1449-1450 [collecting cases].) accordingly, there was ample evidence from which a jury could reasonably conclude that defendant and itehua would commit violence, which could escalate to murder, against anyone whom they viewed as defendant raises four objections to this analysis. finding as to what is a natural and probable consequence. in this case also rested on defe second, defendant contends that the cases cited abovemedina, olguin, godinez and montanoinvolved escalating gang violence against a gang rival, not a bystander. this is true, but these cases did not purport to limit their reasoning to gang rivals. because the people in this case also presented evidence that gang members will violently confront not only gang rivals, but also any bystander who disrespects them, these cases remain relevant. third, defendant cites several cases that, in his view, dictate a contrary conclusion. however, most of those cases are distinguishable on their facts. (see u.s. v. andrews (9th cir. 1996) 75 f.3d 552, 556 [in non-gang context, bystander]; lloway (1990) 102 or.app. 553, 556-558 [795 p.2d 589] [in gang case, no aiding and abetting liability when defendant was one of nine people in the back of a truck from which shots were fired at gang rivals]; juan h. v. allen (9th cir. 2005) 408 f.3d 1262, 1276-1279 [in gang context, no aiding and abetting liability when defendant was simply standing next to person who shot at gang rivals]; u.s. v. pena (6th cir. 1993) 983 f.2d 71, 71-72 [no aiding and 7 abetting liability when defendant was passenger in a car carrying drugs secreted in trunk]; pinell v. superior court (1965) 232 cal.app.2d 284, 288 [no aiding and abetting liability when defendant helped woman sexually assaulted by his nephew and others].) the other cases defendant cites are irrelevant. (see people v. moore (2011) 51 cal.4th 386, 406 [expert testimony that room too speculative]; people v. markus (1978) 82 cal.app.3d 477, 481-482 [setting forth intent requirement for aiding and abetting that was subsequently overruled in people v. montoya (1994) 7 cal.4th 1027, 1040].) lastly, defendant points out that he told the police in his post-arrest interview that he did not know itehua was carrying a gun. argument in this regard denial of knowledge conflicts with other testimony at trial that itehua pulled out the gun before entering the complex in a manner that could be observed by others. the jury resolved that conflict against defendant, and we cannot gainsay that determination on appeal. (people v. armstrong (2016) 1 cal.5th ewing court does not reweigh the evidencegang context, . . . a gang member to have known a medina, supra, 46 cal.4th at p. 924; see also people v. montes (1999) 74 cal.app.4th 1050, 1056 (montes) [so holding].) b. instructional errors we independently review whether the trial court properly instructed the jury. (people v. olivas (2016) 248 cal.app.4th 758, 772.) 1. use of battery and disturbing the peace as intended crimes as explained above, a jury may find a defendant criminally liable not only for the crime he intends to aid and abet a perpetrator in committing, but he perpetrator actually commits . . . that is a natural rangel, supra, 62 cal.4th at pp. 1228-1229.) defendant argues that the trial court erred in instructing the jury that he could be held liable for attempted murder on the basis of the intended crimes of battery and disturbing the peace because (1) those intended crimes cannot, as a matter of law, naturally and probably lead to the attempted murder of bystanders, 8 bystanders, sufficiency-of-the-evidence challengenamely, that in no case can the evidence establish that the attempted murder of a bystander is a natural and probable consequence of a confrontation of a gang rival that disturbs the peace or amounts to a battery. because, as explained above, we conclude that the evidence in this case is sufficient to support the requisite linkextreme position that a jury can never so find. defendant seems to suggest that our analysis of the sufficiency of the evidence in this case does not resolve the matter because we must, when evaluating his more global attack, view the evidence in the light finding. but the cases he cites for this propositionlogacz v. limansky (1999) 71 cal.app.4th 1149, 1152, footnote 2 and krotin v. porsche cars north america, inc. (1995) 38 cal.app.4th 294, 298do not support his proposition; instead, they apply when a court is evaluating the prejudicial impact of an incorrect jury instruction. here, the instructions were correct. cond argument starts from must be a close connection between the [intended] crime aided and abetted prettyman, supra, 14 cal.4th at p. 269.) but his argument overlooks that when evaluating that connection, we do not people v. canizalez (2011) 197 cal.app.4th 832, 854 (canizalez); people v. lucas (1997) 55 cal.app.4th 721, 732-733.) as explained above, the facts of this case indicate a sufficiently confront a rival and violence against anyone who disrespects them as they do so. observation, in prettyman . . . is not prettyman, supra, 14 cal.4th at p. 269.) misdemeanors are not too trivial to lead to murder. (canizalez, supra, 197 9 cal.app.4th . . . is not talismanic in deciding whether the aider and abettor can be convicted of a nontarget murderdepending upon the facts of the case, the courts have held, murder can be a natural and probable consequence of a simple assault or of disturbing the peace (for fighting). (people v. gonzales and soliz (2011) 52 cal.4th 254, 299-300 [simple assault]; montes, supra, 74 cal.app.4th at pp. 1054-1055 [simple assault and breach of the peace for fighting in public].) this was just such a case. as explained above, the people presented a gang often attack bystanders who disrespect them along with evidence that defendant himself struck a was enough to send to the jury the question of whether the intended battery and disturbing the peace against the rival gang member could reasonably and probably lead to the attempted murder of the victims in this case. 2. failure to instruct the jury that it must find that defendant acted intentionally, deliberately and with premeditation in people v. favor (2012) 54 cal.4th 868, 879-880 (favor), our supreme court held that a defendant who aided and abetted a robbery could be convicted of attempted premeditated murder as the natural and probable consequence of the robbery without any proof that the premeditated nature of the murder was foreseeable. attempted murder is a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the crime aided and abetted, and the attempted murder itself was committed [by the actual id. at p. 880.) a few years later, the court in chiu, held that a defendant could no longer be convicted of first degree premeditated murder under the judicially created natural and probable consequences doctrine. (chiu, supra, 59 cal.4th 155 at pp. 158-159, 165-166.) defendant argues that chius rule that the natural and probable consequences doctrine cannot support a conviction for premeditated murder applies with equal force to premeditated attempted murder, and effectively overruled favor. because favor is no longer good law, defendant reasons, he can be convicted of attempted premeditated murder only if a jury specifically finds that he personally foresaw that an attempted murder would be committed intentionally, deliberately and with premeditation. because there 10 was no such jury finding in this case, defendant asserts that the life sentence imposed for attempted premeditated murder exceeds the statutory maximum authorized by section 664, subdivision (a), in violation of apprendi, supra, 530 u.s. 466. to begin, we decline date favor. the chiu court took pains to distinguish favor and to reaffirm its continued validity. (chiu, supra, 59 cal.4th at p. 163.) although the court is currently considering whether to overturn favor, (people v. mateo, review granted may 11, 2016, s232674), the court has yet to do so. until it does, favor remains good law and forecloses that he must personally foresee the premeditated nature of the attempted murder and that he cannot be sentenced to life imprisonment without a jury finding of that fact. (see auto equity sales, inc. v. superior court (1962) 57 cal.2d 450, 455.) c. response to jury note 1. pertinent facts at the close of trial, the trial court instructed the jury on the natural and probable consequences doctrine using calcrim no. 403. that instruction informed the of the circumstances, a reasonable person in the defendant position would have known that the commission of the attempted murder was a natural and probable consequence of the commission of the disturbance of the peace or explanation-described language with the consent of counsel, the court asked the jury foreperson what the jury the foreperson responded that the jury was looking for excusing the foreperson, the court agreed with counsel that the jury was seeking to have the to the question whether attempted murder was a natural and probable consequence of battery or disturbing the peace. with the consent of counsel, the court gave the following response to the jury cannot expand on i 11 2. analysis abdication of its continuing duty to properly instruct the jury on the law. ( 1138 [if the nt of law arising in the case, . . . the information required must be givenpeople v. beardslee (1991) ourt has discretion in deciding whether and how note for an abuse of discretion. (beardslee, at p. 97.) in this case, the trial court did not abuse its discretion. upon receiving the jury note, the court carefully conducted an inquiry into precisely what the jury wanted to know. that inquiry revealed that the jury was looking for the that is, the answer to the ultimate issue the jury was to decide. a court cannot tell a jury how to decide the issues before it. (e.g., people v. montero (2007) 155 cal.app.4th 1170, 1180.) defendant suggests that the court should have restated the standard or quoted snippets from various cases, but doing so stated concern and would have risked either misstating the law (e.g., long v. barbieri (1932) 120 cal.app. rpts from . . . that is, how to decide one of the ultimate issues in the case. for these reasons, the court did not abuse its discretion when it declined to further instruct on the law and instead directed the jury that it had all the law the court could provide. ii. gang enhancement sentencing enhancements depending on the underlying crime. ( 186.22.) organization, association, or group of three or more persons (2) one of its primary activities the l statutorily enumerated crimes, common identifying sign or symbol 12 (that is, two or more of its members have committed two or more statutorily enumerated offenses in the last three years). ( 186.22, subds. (e) & (f).) defendant argues that (1) the gang enhancements as to all three crimes must be vacated due to insufficient evidence of the bellflower devils and (2) the gang enhancement as to the robbery must be vacated because it was a crime he committed on his own and was in no way for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with his gang. we review these claims for substantial evidence. (banks, supra, 59 cal.4th at p. 1156.) a. primary activities people v. sengpadychith (2001) 26 cal.4th 316, consistently and repeatedly (id. at p. 324.) there are g members have consistently and repeatedly committed qualifying crimes, and (people v. vy (2004) 122 cal.app.4th 1209, 1224-1226 [commission of three crimes by a small gang during a three-month period; sufficient]; people v. duran (2002) 97 cal.app.4th 1448, 1457; cf. in re jorge g. (2004) 117 cal.app.4th 931, 944-946 [commission of a single crime; insufficient]; people v. perez (2004) 118 cal.app.4th 151, 160 [commission of three qualifying crimes, including the charged crime, within one week as well as another qualifying crime six years earlier; insufficient]); (2) a gang expert can offer an people v. gardeley (1996) 14 cal.4th 605, 620, overruled on other grounds by people v. sanchez (2016) 63 cal.4th 665 (sanchez); sengpadychith, at p. 324; people v. martinez (2008) 158 purpose is to instill fear and to intimidate, and that gang members have committed qualifying crimes to create such fear and intimidation (duran, at p. 1465). 13 in this case, there is ample evidence that the bellflower devils primary activities were the commission of statutorily enumerated crimes. that the clirange from theft, vandalism, grand theft auto, sales of narcotics, possession of weapons, possession of firearms, witness intimidation, arson, assault, assault with deadly weapons, a nearly all of these crimes are qualifying felonies. ( 186.22, subd. (e)(9), (10), (25) [grand theft, grand theft auto, and unlawful taking of a vehicle], (20) [felony vandalism], (4) [sale and possession for sale of narcotics], (8) [witness intimidation], (23), (31), (32), (33) [possession of firearms and concealed firearms], (7) [arson], (1) [assault with a deadly weapon], (3) [homicide].) this opinion went unchallenged. the people also introduced evidence that bellflower devils clique members committed five statutorily enumerated crimes in a three-year perioda 2010 attempted murder, a 2010 assault with a deadly weapon, and the two attempted murders and the robbery committed in 2012 in this very case. ( 186.22, subd. (e)(1) [assault with a deadly weapon], (2) [robbery], (3) [homicide].) defendant responds with two arguments. citing in re nathaniel c. ed a sufficient foundation. however, the court in nathaniel c. found fault with an because it repeated of which the expert had no personal knowledge. (id. at pp. 1003-1004.) here, the expert relied upon his personal knowledge of the bellflower devils clique of the 18th street gang, a gang with which he was familiar. his opinion was further corroborated by properly admitted conviction documents regarding the two 2010 crimes as well as the evidence admitted as to the 2012 attempted murders and robbery charged in this case. defendant stimony ran afoul of u.s. v. mejia (2d cir. 2008) 545 f.3d 179, 190-191, which prohibits experts from offering case-specific opinions. our supreme court has rejected s rule. (sanchez, suprawhat [case- 14 b. robbery to prove the fact that the defendant was a gang member. (in re frank s.
