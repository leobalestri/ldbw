(a) [count 1]),1 two counts of sexual intercourse or sodomy with a child age 10 or younger ( 288.7, subd. (a) [counts 2 & 3]), and oral copulation or sexual penetration of a child age 10 or younger ( 288.7, subd. (b) [count 4]). the trial court sentenced martinez to the upper term of 8 years in count 1, imposed consecutive terms of 25 years to life in counts 2 and 3, and imposed a consecutive term of 15 years to life in count 4, for a total term of 73 years to life. martinez contends that the trial court misinstructed the jury with respect to the different intents required for conviction in each of the offenses, and that it impermissibly is an element of the offense of lewd act upon a child, to impose the high term in count 1. in supplemental briefing, martinez contends that imposition of court facilities and operations assessments and a restitution fine without a prior determination that he was able to pay violated his rights to equal protection and due process. he also notes a 1 all statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise specified. 3 and the abstract of judgment regarding the amount of the restitution fine imposed. we remand for the trial court to correct the abstract of judgment and minute order dated february 15, 2018, to properly reflect that it imposed a $1,000 restitution fine ( 1202.4, subd. (b)) and imposed and stayed a corresponding $1,000 parole revocation fine ( 1202.45, subd. (a)). in all other respects, the judgment is affirmed. discussion2 instructional error martinez contends that the trial court erred by instructing the jury under calcrim no. 251 that to find him guilty of all of the offenses charged it must find proof that he acted with the requisite specific intent, although several of the offenses with which he was charged are general intent crimes. we conclude that the claim is without merit, but that even if the trial court erred, the error was harmless. 2 we do not include a recitation of the facts, as they are not necessary for resolution of the issues on appeal. 4 legal principles the general principles of law relevant to and governing the case.

(people v. posey (2004) 32 cal.4th 193, 218.) proceedings here, the court instructed the jury as to the union of act and intent with respect to all of the charged offenses under calcrim no. 251, the instruction intended for use when the case involves only specific intent crimes and/or general intent crimes that require a specific mental state, such as knowledge or malice. (judicial council of cal., crim. jury instns.

(bench notes to calcrim nos. 251, 252 (2019) pp. 66, 69.) when a case involves crimes with different intent requirements the court should identify which counts require the specific intent, general intent, and/or a specific mental state in the instruction. (ibid.) 6 act, but must do so with a specific intent. the act and the specific intent required are explained in the instruction for two of the offenses charged, lewd act upon a child under the age of 14 years ( 288, subd. (a)) and sexual penetration of a child 10 years of age or younger ( 288.7, subd. (b)), are specific intent crimes. (see people v. martinez (1995) 11 cal.4th 434, 440, 444 (martinez) [lewd acts]; people v. ngo (2014) 225 cal.app.4th 126, 157 (ngo) [sexual penetration].) sexual intercourse with or sodomy of a child 10 years of age or younger ( 288.7, subd. (a)), and oral copulation of a child 10 years of age or under ( 288.7, subd. (b)) are general intent crimes without mental state requirements, however.4 (see people v. mendoza (2015) 240 cal.app.4th 72, 79 [sexual intercourse and sodomy]; saavedra, supra, 24 cal.app.5th at p. 613 [oral copulation].) thus, the trial court should have instructed the jury under calcrim no. 252, or included calcrim no. 250 in addition to calcrim no. 251.

[citationsaavedra, supra, 24 cal.app.5th at p. 614.) having found that the court did not err in instructing the jury on the general intent crimes, we find it even less crimes were affected. as with the general intent crimes, the jury was properly instructed on the union of act and intent and the necessity that martinez intended to commit the acts under calcrim no. 251. it was further instructed that it must find martinez harbored a specific intent with respect to those crimes and directed to the individual instructions, which undisputedly instructed on intent.7 this case require proof of the union, or joint operation, of act 7 [calcrim no. 1128] cover[s] both the requisite intent per 9 even if we were to find error, however, it would lie in the charge to the jury to find specific intent before it could convict on the general intent crimes, which, as the people point out, could only have benefitted martinez by increasing is harmless under both the federal constitutional standard of harmless error set forth in chapman v. state of california (1967) 386 u.s. 18, 24 [reversal required unless the court is articulated in people v. watson (1956) 46 cal.2d 818, 836 se and the requirement of a concurrence of act and specific intent [for conviction of sexual penetration of a child 10 saavedra, supra, 24 cal.app.5th at pp. 615616, fn. omitted; see also ngo, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 162.) specifically, calcrim no. 1128 sexual penetration means penetration, however slight, of the genital or anal opening of the other person by any foreign object, substance, instrument, or device, or by any unknown object for the purpose of sexual abuse, arousal, (ngo, supra, at p. 162.) calcrim no. 1110, which lists the elements of lewd act upon a child under the age of 14, is even more explicit. it contains the requirethe act with the intent of arousing, appealing to, or gratifying the lust, passions, or sexual desires of himself or the specific intent requirement. 10 more favorable to the appealing party would have been reached in the absence of the error]. sentencing error martinez also contends that the trial court erred in sentencing him to the high term of eight years in state prison in count 1 because it relied on the which was an element of the crime of lewd or lascivious acts upon a child under the age of 14. ( 288, subd. (a).) we reject this contention as well. proceedings following martinez by jury, the trial court held a sentencing hearing during which the prosecution argued the trial court should consivulnerability. specifically, the prosecution cited evidence that martinez knew the victim had once confided in her , and that left the victim in a vulnerable position with no one to believe her or protect her. the prosecution further argued that martinez used this vulnerability to continue the abuse for several years. with respect to the conviction of lewd act upon a child under the age of 14, the trial court pronounced the sentence in count 1 . . mr. martinez is to be imprisoned in the state prison for a determinate term of eight years. the court is selecting the high term as to count 11 1. [] this was an ongoing event. this was not a single isolated experience or even a few experiences. this is a sexual assault on a defenseless little girl over the period of at least a couple of years. her vulnerability, her inability to defend herself, and taking defense counsel did not object selecting the high term. legal principles for abuse of discretion. (people v. sandoval (2007) 41 must be exercised in a manner that is not arbitrary and capricious, that is consistent with the letter and spirit of the dividualized consideration [citation.]ibidrelies upon circumstances that are not relevant to the decision or that otherwise constitute an improper basis for ibid.) where, as in this case, age is an element of defend](people v. dehoyos (2013) 57 cal.4th 79, 154; see also people v. estrada (1986) 176 cal.app.3d 410, 418 (estrada) [proper 12 to consider fact that the victim was a vulnerable, small chil to impose high term].) solely on age, is improper . . . people v. dancer (1996) 45 cal.app.4th 1677, 16931694, disapproved on another ground in people v. hammon (1997) 15 cal.4th 1117.) analysis we agree with the people that martinez forfeited his contention by failing to object below. (people v. scott (1994) the trial court exercises its sentencing discretion and articulates its supporting reasons cannot be raised for the ].) he has also waived his ineffective assistance of counsel claim by failing to raise it in the opening brief. (people v. duff (2014) 58 cal.4th 527, 550, fn. 9 [defendant waived ineffective assistance of counsel claim first raised in reply brief].) however, even if we were to consider the merits of his argument s claim would fail. martinez concedes that the trial court identified several factors in seriatim to support the finding of vulnerability, but attempts to equate is not supported by the transcript of the sentencing hearing. 13 selecting the high term. period instead echoed the that martinez isolated the victim from her mother, leaving the victim without anyone to believe in her or protect her, and that he then used the s isolation to repeatedly abuse her over a course of years, without fear of discovery. (see people v. estrada, supra, 176 cal.app.3d at p. the entire sentencing process reveals no grounds for reversal nce relied on the circumstances of the crimes, and the nature of the victimnot the age. a single factor is (people v. ortiz (2012) 208 cal.app.4th 1354, 1371.) here, the court gave multiple valid reasons for its imposition of the high term, including the fact that the abuse was ongoing, inability to defend herself. we find no abuse of discretion. ability to pay at the sentencing hearing, the trial court imposed court operations assessments totaling $160 ( 1465.8), court facilities assessments totaling $120 (gov. code,  70373), and a restitution fine of $1,000 ( 1202.4, subd. (b)). it imposed and stayed a parole revocation fine of $1,000. 14 ( 1202.45, subd. (a).) martinez did not object to imposition of the assessments and fines, and nothing in the record suggests that he was unable to pay them. martinez contends that the trial courtdetermine whether he had the ability to pay the assessments and fines prior to their imposition violated his constitutional rights to due process and equal protection under people v. dueas (2019) 30 cal.app.5th 1157 (dueas). he requests that we strike the court operations and court facilities assessments, and stay execution of the restitution fine unless and until the people prove that he has the present ability to pay the fine, as the court of appeal in dueas did. martinez argues that the holding of dueas applies to him retroactively because his appeal was not yet final when the case was filed. he contends that he has not forfeited the constitutional claim that raises a pure question of law based time was such that it would have been futile to object before we reject these arguments. preliminarily, we agree with the parties that there is a discrepancy in the imposition of fines that requires clarification. specifically, although the trial court imposed a $1,000 restitution fine and imposed and stayed a corresponding $1,000 parole revocation fine at the sentencing hearing, the abstract of judgment and minute order reflect restitution and parole revocation fines of $300 15 of judgment must be corrected to reflect imposition of the $1,000 restitution fine under section 1202.4, subdivision (b), and imposition and stay of the $1,000 parole revocation fine under section 1202.45, subdivision (a). (see people v. mitchell (2001) 26 cal.4th 181, 185 n abstract of judgment is not the judgment of conviction; it does not control if different from t martinez forfeited any challenge to the trial imposition of a fine, fee, or assessment on the basis that the court failed to consider his ability to pay because he did not object in the trial court. (see people v. frandsen (2019) 33 cal.app.5th 1126, 11531155 (fransdsen).) although there are exceptions to the rule of forfeiture, such as when the defendant raises a constitutional claim that is a pure question of law (people v. welch (1993) 5 cal.4th 228, 235), or when the statan objection would have been futile or wholly unsupported by substantive law then in existence (id. at p. 237), neither exception applies here. a pure question of law based on undisputed facts. (people v. yeoman (2003) 31 cal.4th 93, 118.) rather, he requests a factual determination of his alleged inability to pay based on a record that contains nothing more than his reliance on appointed counsel . . . frandsen, supra, 33 cal.app.5th at p. 1153.) with respect to the futility of an objection, ability to pay was a statutory consideration with respect to 16 the $1,000 restitution fine, which was by far the most significant fine imposed. section 1202.4 requires a trial court to impose a restitution fine between $300 and $10,000 do so in any case in which a person is convicted of a felony. ( 1202.4, subd. (b).) the statute permits the trial court to imposes a fine greater than the $300 statutory minimum, as 1202.4, subd. (c).) it demonsfrandsen, supra, 33 cal.app.5th at p. 1154.) because the $1,000 restitution fine imposed is greater than the statutory minimum, it would not have been futile for martinez to request an ability to pay determination, which the statute expressly contemplates, and his failure to do so forfeits his argument on appeal. (ibid.) finally, any record that martinez made regarding his inability to pay the $1,000 restitution fine would have also addressed the $280 in court operations assessments ( 1465.8) and court facilities assessments (gov. code,  fine based on inability to pay, [martinez] has not shown a basis to vacate assessments totaling [$280] for inability to frandsen, supra, 33 cal.app.5th at p. 1154.) 17 disposition we remand for the trial court to correct the abstract of judgment and minute order dated february 15, 2018, to properly reflect that it imposed a $1,000 restitution fine ( 1202.4, subd. (b)) and imposed and stayed a corresponding $1,000 parole revocation fine ( 1202.45, subd. (a)). in all other respects, the judgment is affirmed. moor, j. we concur: rubin, p. j. kim, j.
