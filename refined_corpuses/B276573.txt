(a)(1)) in 1996. after the trial court found true allegations that he had suffered three prior convictions within the meaning of the three strikes law ( 667, subds. (b)-(i), 1170.12, subds. (a)-(d)), he was sentenced to a prison term of 25 years to life plus one year for a prior prison term enhancement ( 667.5, subd. (b)). in february 2013, defendant filed a petition for recall of sentence under section 1170.126 (proposition 36). the trial court denied the petition, and defendant appeals. we affirm the order. background ossession of a firearm by a felon, we described the facts of his offense as follows: on october 7, 1995, he was a patrol arrest warrant for [defendant], who was suspected of having committed robberies in the area. other officers accompanied detective ortiz to the he got a radio call from detective decker, who was outside the residence. decker told him he had just spoken to two women coming -in-law, sherril lyn white, and that she also lived there. 1 further undesignated statutory references are to the penal code. 3 men told decker that [defendant] was inside the house. white said that the front door to the house was open, the screen door was unlocked, and they could go inside. approached the house and entered through the open front door. ortiz entered, although this was not noted in his police report. the officers went through the front door, into a living room. from there, they could see an open bedroom door. as they entered that bedroom, they yelled at department. be sleeping. he was ordered to raise his hands. he raised his right hand, but his left hand remained under his pillow. after repeated instructions, he raised both hands, and the officers saw the butt of a gun protruding from beneath the pillow. at the hearing to determine for resentencing under section 1170.126, the people submitted several witness testimony, a portion ohearing, and portions of testimony from the trial. based upon the evidence presented, the trial court found by a preponderance of the evidence and beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was statutorily ineligible for recall and resentencing under section 1170.126 because 4 during the commission of the current offense, defendant was armed discussion section 1170.126 provides that an offender serving a three strikes sentence may be eligible for resentencing where the current felony conviction is not a serious or violent felony. (people v. johnson (2015) 61 cal.4th 674, 681.) however, an offender is statutorily ing the commission of the current offense, the defendant used a firearm, was armed with a firearm or deadly weapon, or intended to cause great bodily injury to another ( 667, subd. (e)(2)(c)(iii), 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(c)(iii), 1170.126, subd. (e)(2); people v. johnson, supra, 61 cal.4th at p. 681.) defendant contends on appeal that rules of statutory construction compel the conclusion that proposition 36s exclusion from resentencing for felons who are armed during the commission of the underlying offense applies only where the arming facilitates commission of that offense or an additional offense, and not when the firearm is merely available for use. we disagree. construed to mean having a firearm available for use, either offensively people v. osuna (2014) 225 cal.app.4th 1020, 1029.) it is the availability of and ready access to the weapon that constitutes arming. (people v. white (2014) 223 cal.app.4th 512, 524, 527 [armed-with-a-dangerous-weapon exclusion does not require that the arming be anchored or tethered to an offense that does not include simple 5 possession].) obviously, the threat presented by a firearm increases in direct proportion to its accessibility; a firearm that is available for use as a weapon creates the danger that it will be used. (people v. white (2016) 243 cal.app.4th 1354, 1363.) here, the record establishes that at the time of his arrest for possession of a firearm by a felon, defendant was armed with a firearm, because he had ready access to the weapon, which was under his pillow while he was lying on the bed. therefore, the trial court properly found that he was ineligible for resentencing under section 1170.126. (people v. white, supra, 223 cal.app.4th at p. 519 [where the record of conviction establishes that the defendant was convicted of possession of a firearm by a felon and was armed with the firearm during commission -with-a-firearm exclusion applies and the 1170.126].) as defendant concedes, many courts of appeal have rejected his argument that the armed-with-a-firearm exclusion cannot apply to a conviction for possession of a firearm by a felon. (see, e.g., people v. white, supra, 243 cal.app.4th at pp. 1360-1365; people v. burnes (2015) 242 cal.app.4th 1452, 1458; people v. hicks (2014) 231 cal.app.4th 275, 283-285; people v. brimmer (2014) 230 cal.app.4th 782, 797-799; people v. elder (2014) 227 cal.app.4th 1308, 1312-1314; people v. osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at pp. 1029-1038; people v. blakely (2014) 225 cal.app.4th 1042, 1051-1057; people v. white, supra, 223 cal.app.4th at pp. 519, 523-524.) we agree with the reasoning of these 6 decisions, and conclude that the trial court petition to recall his sentence. disposition the order denying the petition to recall the sentence is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports willhite, acting p. j. we concur: manella, j. collins, j.
