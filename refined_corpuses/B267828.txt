someone got out of the truck and 3 entered the house. ten minutes later, the same person got back into the truck and drove away. a california highway patrol officer stopped the truck for having illegally tinted windows. the driver, victor lopez (lopez), consented to a search of the truck. tucked center console was $26,700 in cash wrapped in a black plastic bag. ten cell phones were scattered through the truck. lopez had $800 in the pocket of his pants. when questioned about the cash, lopez said the money belonged to his brother. lopez was arrested and booked; facing deportation, he voluntarily left the united states.1 based on their observations, on the opinion that lopez was acting as a drug courier who had just dropped off cocaine and picked up $26,700 in cash plus an $800 commission for himself, and on additional information contained in a sealed portion of the affidavit, law enforcement agents sought and obtained a search warrant for the house on west 87th place. the warrant was executed a little after 1:00 a.m. on december 20. -year- the house or its back house. s bedrooms was (1) a shopping bag containing cocaine (weighing one kilogram each) wrapped in black electrical tape, and (2) a shoebox containing $68,724 in cash. a small plastic baggie containing rock cocaine was found in the rear den. to secure the premises, officers escorted all four occupants out of the house. because it was cold outside and because 1 lopez subsequently returned to the united states, and the people provided defense counsel with the address they had for lopez; however, counsel was unable to locate lopez. 4 defendant was only in his pajama bottoms, police brought defendant back into the house within 15 minutes. approximately 30 minutes later, defendant was arrested and transported to the hawthorne police station. at some point thereafter, a social worker from the los angeles county department of children and family services arrived at the house and took custody of the seven-year-presence in a house where drug dealing was taking place. defendant was interviewed at the police station approximately two hours and fifteen minutes after he was transported away from his house. during the recorded interview, defendant admitted to buying d -five, 26-selling the cocaine to others in usand in cash in the shoebox. ii. procedural history the people charged defendant with (1) possessing a controlled substance for sale (health & saf. code,  11351), and (2) possessing more than $25,000 in proceeds from a drug transaction (id.,  11370.9, subds. (a) & (f)). the people further alleged that defendant possessed more than one kilogram of cocaine (id.,  11370.4, subd. (a)(1)), that his 1994 conviction for the attempted murder of a federal agent constituted a strike under our three strikes law (pen. code,  667, subds. (b)-(j) & 1170.12, subds. (a)-(d)), and that his 1994 federal conviction for possessing a controlled substance with intent to sell (21 u.s.c.  841) constituted a prior drug conviction (health & saf. code,  11370.2, subd. (a)). 5 defendant filed several pretrial motions, including (1) a motion to obtain law enforcement personnel records under pitchessunavailability; (3) a motion to dismiss the charges due to the cash seized from his house and from lopez; (4) a motion to unseal the sealed portion of the search warrant affidavit; and (5) a motion to suppress his confession because it was obtained in violation of miranda v. arizona (1966) 384 u.s. 436 (miranda) and was involuntary. the trial court denied all of these motions. the matter proceeded to trial, and a jury convicted defendant of all counts and found all enhancements to be true. the court subsequently found all prior convictions true. the trial court imposed a prison sentence of 11 years. specifically, the court imposed a nine-year sentence on the possession count (comprised of a base term of three years, doubled due to the prior strike, plus an additional three years due to drug quantity), to be followed by a two-year sentence on the drug proceeds count (comprised of one-third the midterm (one-third of three years) doubled due to strike). defendant filed this timely appeal. discussion i. discovery-related motions a. pitchess motion 1. additional background defendant filed a motion asking the trial court to review the personnel records of 35 law enforcement officers from 12 different agencies who were on the task force or who otherwise had anything to do with the stop of of the search warrant at defendant house. he sought 6 information regarding tactics, suppression of evidence, improper reporting, violation of the fourth, fifth and/or sixth amendment, false testimony, and acts of untruthfulness, fabricati in support of the motion, defense counsel submitted an affidavit stating, on information and belief, that all of the 35 officers st, placed or caused false statements to be placed in the affidavit attached to the search fendant confessed. the trial court denied the motion without granting an in camera hearing. -forth . . . why this would have occurred, how it would have occurred, what the motivation for it to have occurred would have been, how all of these officers could have been drawn into this 2. analysis conditionally privileged under california law. (pen. code,  832.5, 832.7, 832.8.) they are not wholly immune from disclosure; instead, they may be disclosed if the party seeking them follows separate procedures articulated in pitchess, supra, 11 cal.3d 531 and later codified in evidence code sections 1043 through 1047. under these procedures, a co 7 that is, a showing that the agency from which the records and complaints are sought possesses them and, more relevant here, a showing that the bject matter (b)(3).) to establish materiality, the requesting party must (1) set the information litigation and how the information would support a defense or warrick v. superior court (2005) 35 cal.4th 1011, 1021, 1025-1027; california highway patrol v. superior court (2000) 84 cal.app.4th 1010, 1021.) to qualify as people v. sanderson (2010) 181 cal.app.4th 1334, 1340-1341; eulloqui v. superior court (2010) 181 cal.app.4th 1055, 1064; people v. galan (2009) 178 cal.app.4th 6, 12-13 (galan).) the proffered scenario need (people v. thompson (2006) 141 cal.app.4th 1312, 1316-1317 (thompson); sanderson, at p. 1340; warrick, at pp. 1025-1026), thompson, at pp. 1318-1319). we review a trial ssessment of good cause for an abuse of discretion. (people v. lewis and oliver (2006) 39 cal.4th 970, 992.) the trial court did not abuse its discretion in concluding although it is som 8 might falsify a police report recording allegedly illegal acts (uybungco v. superior court (2008) 163 cal.app.4th 1043, 1049-1050), a trial court does not abuse its discretion in concluding that it is not plausible that a large number of officers at least without some explanation of why they would single out the defendant. (thompson, supra, 141 cal.app.4th at pp. 1317-1318). as the trial court noted, thompson is directly on point. there, the court scenario when he asserted that police officers conspired to fabricate virtually all the events preceding and following his ion for police were singling him out. (thompson, at pp. 1317-1319.) for to plant drugs and money in his house, as well as to fabricate also not plausible, especially when he provides no explanation as counter-surveillance behavior or the smaller quantity of cocaine located elsewhere in the house, and no explanation for how nearly three dozen officers from a dozen different agencies could have been drawn into such a conspiracy. defendant raises two further arguments. first, he asserts that on appeal he is only seeking the personnel records for the lead detective who interviewed him (and thus abandoning his request for the records of the 34 other officers involved in the events leading up to and postdating his arrest). however, this 9 does not remedy the abseabove, is still premised on the existence of an implausible conspiracy to lie about everything that happened on december 19, and 20, 2012. second, defendant argues that the trial court was wrong, in finding that his proffered factual scenario was internally inconsistent, to rely upon his failure to deny that cocaine was found in his house or to repudiate his recorded confession because those events occurred after the search of his house, and he was seeking personnel records to attack the search itself. this argument ignores that defendant was also seeking the records to impeach any testifying officers at trial, for which the post-search inconsistencies remain relevant. (galan, supra, 178 cal.app.4th at p. 13.) further, even if we were to agree that the trial court should not have considered the post-search inconsistencies in evaluating plausibility with respect to whether the search was valid, proffered factual scenario is independently implausible for the reasons set forth above. (cf. people v. chism (2014) 58 cal.4th 1266, 1295 & fn. not its reasoning].) b. motion based o 1. additional background prior to trial, defendant moved and then renewed his motion to dismiss the case against him on the ground that the people allowed lopez, a material witness, to be deported. although defendant frankly acknowledged that he did not know what testimony lopez might offer, he argued that lopez was might testify that he (lopez) had secretly planted the cocaine in 10 windows were not illegally tinted. the trial court denied the motion, finding that the law enforcement agencies involved in the task force did not secure lopez 2. analysis a criminal defendant has a constitutional right, as part of the right to compulsory process and the right of due process, not to have the government make witnesses unavailable to the defense, including through deporting those witnesses. (united states v. valenzuela-bernal (1982) 458 u.s. 858, 872-873 (valenzuela-bernal) [noting federal constitutional right]; people v. jacinto (2010) 49 cal.4th 263, 267 [noting state constitutional right]; people v. coffman and marlow (2004) 34 cal.4th 1, 52.) however, this right only extends to witnesses who can offer and favorable valenzuela-bernal, at pp. 872-873, italics added.) although the absence of a missing witness eshowing material[] the basis for wholly dispensing with such a id. at pp. 870, 873.) findings for substantial evidence, but review de novo its ultimate determination of whether those facts satisfy the constitutional standard. (e.g., people v. ramos (1997) 15 cal.4th 1133, 1154.) testimony would have been favorable to hstatements to police at the time of the traffic stop did not exonerate defendant, and defendant freely admits that he has no idea what lopez might actually say. this is insufficient. indeed, 11 btimony would not exculpate defendant because lopez said the money belonged to rafficking drugs with lopez. testimony would be favorable to him; all that is required, defendant says, is that lopez be a material witnessthat is, someone in a position to have been a percipient witness to the alleged crime. for support, defendant cites people v. mejia (1976) 57 cal.app.3d 574. defendant correctly summarizes s holding (mejia, at pp. 579-581 ate [the defendant is] required, but overlooks that valenzuela-bernal displaced s laxer standard. (people v. jenkins (1987) 190 cal.app.3d 200, 205-206.) defendant resists this conclusion, noting that mejia still sets forth the pertinent standard under the california constitution. (cordova v. superior court (1983) 148 cal.app.3d 177, 183-184.) this is true, but irrelevant to the question of from suppressing evidence in a criminal case unless its admission violates the federal constitution, even if it violates the california constitution. (cal. const., art. i,  28, subd. (f)(2); in re lance w. (1985) 37 cal.3d 873, 895-896.) because defendant has not him, he has not demonstrated a violation of the federal constitution and is not entitled to suppression.2 2 in light of this conclusion, we need not decide whether the 12 c. motion based on destruction of evidence 1. additional background defendant sought dismissal of the charges against him on the ground that law enforcement commingled the cash seized from his house and the cash seized from lopez with cash seized in other investigations, and allowed the cash in this case to be forfeitedwhich, in the end, made it impossible for defendant to test the cash from his house to show that it did not have his fingerprints on it. the trial court denied the motion, finding that any material meaningful way[through, for example, the] testimony from a [finger]print expertexondefendant. the court also found no evidence that law enforcement acted in bad faith. 2. analysis although law enforcement generally has no duty to collect evidence (people v. montes (2014) 58 cal.4th 809, 837), it has a constitutional duty in certain instances to preserve the evidence it collects (people v. carrasco (2014) 59 cal.4th 924, 961). if the evidence collected has adestruction violates the police act in bad faith. (carrasco, at pp. 961-962; people v. depriest (2007) 42 cal.4th 1, 41-42 (depriest); see also california v. trombetta (1984) 467 u.s. 479, 489; arizona v. youngblood (1988) 488 u.s. 51, 57.) the standard of review is somewhat unsettled (people v. velasco (2011) 194 cal.app.4th 13 1258, 1262); we will give defendant the benefit of the doubt by motion. the money (or its wrapping) had no apparent exculpatory value; it had not been examined for fingerprints, so there is no way to know whether any prints that might have been found would exonerate or inculpate defendant. at best, the money was potentially useful to the defense but defendant adduced no evidence that the police acted in bad faith in commingling the cash or in allowing it to be forfeited. (depriest, supra, 42 cal.4th at p. 42.) to the contrary, the reason law fingerprinting was a good onenamely, that defendant already admitted the cash was his. defendant cites people v. bowles (2011) 198 cal.app.4th 318, 322-324fingerprint result criminal discovery under the criminal discovery act (pen. code,  1054 et seq.) and brady v. maryland (1963) 373 u.s. 83. however, there was no fingerprint resultconclusive or notin this case. (see people v. medina (1990) 51 cal.3d 870, 893 [police destroyed bottle bearing fingerprint; no violation because police r, or to what extent, the . . . printshat is more, bowles did not speak to whether an inconclusive result was obviouslyor apparentlyexculpatory, and strongly suggested that it was not when it stated that the inconclusive result was not material. (bowles, at pp. 324-326.) 14 ii. suppression motions a. motion to unseal search warrant affidavit 1. additional background defendant filed a motion to unseal the sealed portion of the affidavit accompanying the search warrant for his house. the trial court went in camera to examine the sealed portion of the affidavit. the court ultimately denied the motion to unseal, material omissions or misstatements [in the affidavit], nor was there a the court also declined to examine, in chambers, the confidential informant referenced in the sealed portion of the affidavit. 2. analysis the people have the right, when seeking a search warrant, to ask the magistrate to seal any portion of the affidavit if that portion is protected by either the official information or people v. hobbs (1994) 7 cal.4th 948, 971; evid. code,  1040 [official information privilege] & in striking a balance between interest in maintaining the applicable privilege against a e a search warrant, a defendant may ask the court to unseal the affidavit. (hobbs, at pp. 962, 971-972; people v. heslington (2011) 195 cal.app.4th 947, 957.) a court asked to unseal a warrant must examine the sealed portions of the affidavit in camera, and ask two questions: (1) does the applicable privilege continue to apply to the sealed portions of the affidavit?, and, if a fidavit remains sealed, (2) is there a that the defendant would prevail on a motion to quash (by demonstrating no substantial basis for a 15 finding of probable cause) or to traverse the warrant (by establishing that the affiant knowingly or recklessly included in the affidavit a false statement material to probable cause)? (heslington, at pp. 957-958 & fn. 7.) if the answer to both are put to a choice: consent to the unsealing of the affidavit or suffer suppression of the searchfruits. (ibid.; see also evid. code,  1042, subd. (d).) we review a independently reviewing the sealed portions ourselves and asking whether the trial court abused its discretion. (hobbs, at p. 976; people v. martinez (2005) 132 cal.app.4th 233, 241-242.) the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to unseal. we have examined the sealed portion of the ruling that there is no portion, that defendant would prevail on a motion to quash or traverse the warrant. indeed, there is ample probable cause based solely on the unsealed portion of the affidavit. thus, the well as his motion to unseal. defendant argues that the trial court erred in not examining the confidential informant in chambers, asserting that it is mandatory. it is not mandatory. (davis v. superior court (2010) 186 cal.app.4th 1272, 1277-quired at the in camera hearingnor was the failure to examine the confidential informant an abuse of discretion, as he/she was not a percipient witness to the events occurring on december 19, 2012, point[ed] the finger of suspicion toward a person who has violated people v. goliday (1973) 8 cal.3d 771, 16 782.) what is more, the search itself turned up drugs and money, thereby confirming the validity of the information he/she provided. (see people v. benjamin (1999) 77 cal.app.4th 264, 268, 275-276 [noting that results of search may be used to support truthfulness of statements in affidavit, when their veracity is attacked].) b. motion to suppress statement 1. additional background at the beginning of the interview of defendant at the police station, a local police detective handed defendant a written document delineating the miranda rights, had defendant read it aloud, and ask signature below a line that read: have read this statement of my rights, or i have been informed orally of my rights, and i understand what my rights are. i am willing to make a statement and answer questions. i do not want just paper[?] right there, it says signature, and at that point, a federal agent who was the second of those rights, you can stop want to talk to megonna ask me trick questions, we gonna stop talking. just tell me, fuck that bullshit. what brought you to my house? you tell me, what 17 brought you to my house. a search warrant brought you to my defendant moved to suppress the admission of his subsequent confession on two grounds: (1) his confession was involuntary because he confessed only after police adduced his cooperation by threatening to have social services take custody of e in the cold; and (2) his miranda waiver was involuntary in advisement that defendant was not waiving his rights and in light of the threats he received. after conducting an evidentiary hearing at which the local he trial court denied the motion. the court rdaughter in foster care if he did not cooperate. the court of the miranda form as based on the federal that defendant understood his right to remain silent and impliedly waived it by continuing to talk with the investigators. 2. analysis a. due process both the federal and california constitutions, as a matter of due process, preclude the admission of an involuntary confession. (people v. winbush (2017) 2 cal.5th 402, 452; u.s. const., 14th amend.; cal. const., art. i,  7.) a confession is e by coercive police conduct. (winbush, at p. 452; people v. carrington (2009) 18 47 cal.4th 145, 169.) in assessing whether a confession is involuntary, courts look to the totality of the circumstances, including factors relevant to the interrogation itself (that is, the interrogation tactics used, the length of the interrogation, its location, its continuity) as well as factors relevant to the defendant (that is, his maturity, education, physical condition, and mental health). (people v. massie (1998) 19 cal.4th 550, evidence, but its ultimate determination of voluntariness de novo. (winbush, at pp. 452-453.) voluntary. the local detective testified that he never threatened defendant social services if defendant did not cooperate, and the trial court contrary. we are required to defer to that credibility finding. (people v. armstrong (2016) 1 cal.5th 432, 451.) as a result, there is no credible evidence in the record of any threats or leniency involuntary. (cf. people v. mcwhorter (2009) 47 cal.4th 318, 347 ats or lynumn v. illinois (1963) 372 u.s. 528, 534-535 [police told woman that she will lose welfare benefits for her children if she does not cooperate; involuntary]; people v. trout (1960) 54 cal.2d 576, 585 [police threatened ry], overruled on another ground in people v. cahill (1993) 5 cal.4th 478, 509, fn. 17; united states v. tingle (9th cir. 1981) 658 f.2d 1332, 1335-1336 [police threatened children from her; involuntary].) to the extent defendant 19 suggests that the social worker did not have sufficient grounds to on the law (welf. & inst. code,  306, subd. (a)) and irrelevant because s house (or been transported to the police station. defendant also argues on appeal that his confession was involuntary because he was required to wait outside for 15 minutes in the cold until he could be escorted back into his house. although subjecting a defendant to extreme physical conditions can render a confession chill did not render involuntary the confession that he gave nearly three hours later while in a climate-controlled interrogation room. b. miranda as a prophylactic means of protecting against the pressures inherent to custodial interrogation, police must advise suspects of their rights to remain silent and to the assistance of counsel and obtain a waiver of those rights before the people may use any subsequent statement in its case-in-chief. (people v. jackson (2016) 1 cal.5th 269, 338-express or implied. (people v. sauceda-contreras (2012) 55 (people v. cunningham (2015) 61 cal.4th 609, 642), and may be based on the conduct, after understanding his rights, in answering questions posed to him by law enforcement (berghuis v. thompkins (2010) 560 u.s. 370, 382-384). any waiverexpress or impliedmust, viewed in the totality of the circumstances, be both knowing and 20 awareness of both the nature of the right being abandoned and choice rather than sauceda-contreras, at p. 219, quoting moran v. burbine (1986) 475 u.s. 412, 421.) we review de novo the question of whether a waiver was knowing and voluntary, while reviewing the underlying facts found by the trial court for substantial evidence. (people v. williams (2010) 49 cal.4th 405, 425.) the trial court correctly concluded that defendant impliedly advisement that defendant was not waiving his rights by signing the waiver undoubtedly precluded any finding of express waiver signing of the written form. however, the talking at any timewillingness to invoke that right to stop talking if the investigators kept asking him shows that defendant knew he had a right to remain silent and that his explained above, it was not the product of threats to take away the cold nearly three hours earlier. iii. cumulative error because there was no error, there was no cumulative error. (e.g., people v. melendez (2016) 2 cal.5th 1, 33.) iv. clerical error in sentence defendant points out, and the people concede, that the 21 sentence on the currency possession countthat is, one-third the midterm (one-third of three years) doubled due to the strike. disposition the sentence on count 2 is modified to reflect that the consecutive sentence imposed was one-third of the middle term. the clerk of the superior court is directed to forward a certified copy of the corrected abstract of judgment to the department of corrections and rehabilitation. as modified, the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. ______________________, j. hoffstadt we concur: _________________________, acting p. j. ashmann-gerst _________________________, j.* goodman * retired judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
