(a)). for the july 28, 2016 incident, the people charged scott with second degree burglary and driving or taks consent (veh. code,  10851, subd. (a)). on july 27, 2017 the jury convicted scott on all charges. d. august 3, 2017 on august 3, 2017 the trial court held the sentencing hearing. for the april 28, 2016 incident, the court sentenced scott on the burglary count to the upper term of three years,3 and on the vandalism count to a concurrent term of the lower term of one year four months. for the july 28, 2016 incident, the court sentenced scott on the burglary count to the middle term of two years, and on the driving or tak 2 undesignated statutory references are to the penal code. 3 the court mistakenly referred to it as the july 28, 2016 burglary. 5 4 both to be served concurrently with the sentence on the burglary conviction for the april 28, 2016 incident. discussion scott argues the trial court erred in not staying under section 654 the concurrent sentences the court imposed on the vandalism count in connection with the april 28, 2016 incident and the driving or taking a vehicle count in connection with the july 28, 2016 incident. a. applicable law section 654 prohibits separate punishment for multiple offenses arising from the same act or from a series of acts constituting an indivisible course of criminal conduct. (people v. williams (2013) 57 cal.4th 776, 781; people v. rodriguez (2009) 47 cal.4th 501, 507.) minal conduct is divisible and therefore gives rise to more than one act within the meaning of section 654 depends on the intent and objective of the actor. if all of the offenses were incident to one objective, the defendant may be punished for any one of such offenses but not 4 the lower term for driving or taking a vehicle is one year four months, not two years. (see veh. code,  10851, subd. (a);  1170, subd. (h).) scott, however, did not object to this mistake at sentencing, nor does he argue on appeal the trial court erred in imposing a two-year sentence, rather than a 16-month sentence, on this count. scott simply states in his opening brief that the trial court imposwithout consent . . . sentence unauthorized. 6 (rodriguez, at p. 507, italics omitted; people v. phung (2018) 25 cal.app.5th 741, 760.) broad latitude in determining whether section 654, subdivision (people v. garcia (2008) 167 cal.app.4th 1550, 1564; accord, people v. archer (2014) 230 cal.app.4th 693, 703; see people v. deegan (2016) 247 cal.app.4th 532, 545e question whether section 654 is factually applicable to a given series of offenses is for the trial court, and the law gives the trial court broad latitude in making this determination) we review an implied finding that two crimes were separate, involving separate objectives,substantial evidence. (people v. brents (2012) 53 cal.4th 599, 618; see people v. redd (2014) 228 cal.app.4th 465, 499.) failure to object under section 654 at the time of sentencing does not forfeit appellate review of the issue because imposition of a sentence that violates section 654 results in an unauthorized sentence. (people v. scott (1994) 9 cal.4th 331, 354, fn. 17, people v. mccoy (2012) 208 cal.app.4th 1333, 1338.) the trial court must impose a full term a (people v. relkin (2016) 6 cal.app.5th 1188, 1198.) nder section 654, a stayed sentence is one that has first been imposed, but because of some legal rule must be stayed to prevent the infliction of any punishment for such imposed sentence. imposing a stayed sentence results in the receipt of a sentence, albeit one that is not executed absent some subsequent reason to lift the stay.(people v. jones (2015) 236 cal.app.4th 1411, 1416.) 7 b. the trial court should have stayed execution of sentence on vandalism conviction the felony underlying the april 28, 2016 burglary was theft. although the information alleged scott entered a guilty of bucould not find the defendant guilty of burglary unless [they] all agree that he intended to had the jury convicted scott of burglary and theft in connection with the april 28, 2016 incident, section 654 would apply. (see people v. islas (2012) 210 cal.app.4th 116, 130 hen a defendant is convicted of burglary and the intended felony underlying the burglary, section 654 prohibits punishment for both crimespeople v. alford (2010) 180 cal.app.4th 1463, 1468 [section 654 preclude[s] punishment for both burglary and theft where . . . the burglary is based on an entry with intent to commit that theftpeople v. cline (1998) 60 cal.app.4th 1327, 1336 [section 654 applied to convictions for theft and commercial burglary]; people v. bernal (1994) 22 cal.app.4th 1455, 1458 [section 654 applied to convictions for burglary and theft occurring during the burglary]; see also people v. mcfarland (1962) 58 cal.2d 7convictions for burglary of a hospital and theft of an air compressor from the hospital where the record contained nothing indicating that he entered the hospital with intent to commit some crime other than theft) 8 does it make a difference, as the people suggest, that the underlying conviction here was vandalism and not theft? not in this case. the evidence showed that scott broke into the car looked around the service area for some, was unable to find any tools readily available, and vandalized a closed toolbox to get access to the tools he stole. as the people characterize his movements that nightook some tools that he apparently found in the shop and pried open was the basis of the vandalism charge . . . e only reason scott vandalized the toolboxes was to steal tools. the prosecutor emphasized this point in her closing arguments, telling the jury the prosecutor argued that, to completely tear the property of the toolboxes . . . there was no evidence, substantial or otherwise, scott damaged or destroyed a toolbox on april 28, 2016 for any reason or with any intent other than to steal its contents. the burglary, theft, and vandalism on april 28, 2016 constituted one indivisible transaction with one criminal objective, where the vandalism was not independent of, and was to, the goal of committing theft. (people v. harrison (1989) 48 cal.3d 321, 335; see people v. petronella (2013) 218 cal.app.4th 945, 963-964 limit[s] punishment for multiple convictions arising out of either an act or omission or a course of conduct deemed to be indivisible in 9 time, in those instances wherein the accused entertained a principal objective to which other objectives, if any, were merely incidental]; people v. powell (2011) 194 cal.app.4th 1268, 1296 [i]f all of the crimes were merely incidental to, or were the means of accomplishing or facilitating one objective, a defendant may be punished only once.) therefore, the trial court should have imposed and stayed execution of the 16-month sentence on in re william s. (1989) 208 cal.app.3d 313, cited by the people, is distinguishable. in that case two minors broke into an occupied house at night through a bedroom window, stole items from a hallway cabinet, and left the house through the front door after unlocking it. they through the front door, stole a wallet and keys from the kitchen, left again, and returned a third time, when one of the residents was waiting for them. (id. at pp. 315-316.) the court held that the minors committed two separate burglaries and that section 654 did not bar multiple punishments for the two crimes. (id. at pp. 316-318.) the court explained that crimes were committed by means of two distinct and different entries, separated both in time and place, and with the intent to steal entirely different s finding of two completed burglaries which were not so intertwined in a continuous course of conduct to justify application of penal code section 654id. at p. 319.) the facts here are very different. scott entered the commercial establishment once on april 28, 2016, vandalized toolboxes in order to gain access to tools, stole the tools, and left. he did make several efforts to open different toolboxes, but he was still 10 in different areas of the same shop and was engaged in a continuous course of conduct designed to steal tools. c. the trial court should have stayed execution of sentence on conviction for driving or taking a whether section 654 precluded separate punishments for the crimes scott committed on july 28, 2016 is a closer question. a defendant can commit the crime of driving or taking a vehicle, in violation of vehicle code section 10851, in several ways(people v. page (2017) 3 cal.5th 1175, 1180.) a person can [u]nlawfully taking a vehicle with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of possession.[citation.] sectwhen the driving occurs or continues after the theft is complete (referred to by the supreme court as posttheft driving) or by driving [a vehicle] with the intent only to temporarily deprive its owner of possession (i.e. joyriding). (people v. gutierrez (2018) 20 cal.app.5th 847, 854; see pagevehicle code section 10851 punishes not only taking a vehicle, but also driving it without the ownewith intent either to permanently or temporarily deprive the owner thereof of his or her title to or possession of the vehicle, whether with or without intent to steal the vehicleaking a vehicle with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of possession is a form of theft,osttheft driving and joyriding are not. (gutierrez, at p. 854; see people v. jackson (2018) 26 cal.app.5th 371, 377-378 he unlawful taking of a vehicle with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of possession is a theft offense, but the unlawful driving of a vehicle is not 11 here, the only evidence was that scott stole the pickup truck. there was no evidence scott drove the truck after he completed the theft of the truck on july 28, 2016 and no evidence scott only temporarily drove the truck. the testimony was that the truck was never seen again. in addition, tunder vehicle code section 10851 was theft of the truck. the spect to [the] july 28, with respect to the . . . unlawful taking or driving of a vehicle, referring to the under vehicle code section 10851 was a theft conviction, and under section 654 the court could not punish scott for burglary and theft. (see people v. islas, supra, 210 cal.app.4th at p. 130.) people v. see (1980) 109 cal.app.3d 76, cited by the people, is distinguishable. in that case and another person broke into a business office and stole several thousand dollars worth of office equipment. they removed the stolen items s car. - a truck and returned to the office building to remove a safe they had seen but could not remove by car. when they later opened the safe and found only papers, they abandoned the truck and safe.id. at p. 79.) the court held section 654 did not prohibit separate punishment for burglary and driving or taking a veconsent becauseonthere were in fact two burglaries, one before the theft of a truck and one afterthe first burglary was completed 12 before the truck was taken to effect the second burglary, it was a separate crime and incident to a separate course of conduct.(see, at p. 80.) truck [was] a separate intent obviously formed after [the defendant] burglarized the office building and discovered the first burglary and the later car theft were separated in time, place and victim.id. at p. 81.) here, unlike people v. see and william s., there was only one burglary on july 28, pickup truck was incidental to the burglary on that date. disposition the convictions are affirmed. the matter is remanded with directions for the trial court to impose but stay execution of the concurrent sentences for vandalism and driving or taking a segal, j. we concur: perluss, p. j. feuer, j.
