imposition of sentence was suspended, and defendant was placed on probation for three years on various terms and conditions. defendant presents two issues on appeal. first, he argues the trial court erred by denying his motion to suppress evidence pursuant to penal code section 1538.5 because the arresting officers effected a detention without an in-camera review of peace officer personnel records under pitchess v. superior court (1974) 11 cal.3d 531 (pitchess). we affirm. 1 all further statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise indicated. 3 motion to suppress pursuant to penal code section 1538.5 prosecution evidence on march 26, 2016, at approximately 5:00 p.m., defendant was approached by uniformed los angeles police department officers pedersen2 and osteen while defendant and another male were walking on a public sidewalk in a high-crime neighborhood. defendant was walking northbound on the sidewalk while the officers were driving southbound on the street. all parties were on the same side of the road. because he was wearing a hooded sweatshirt when the officer pedersen wanted to speak to defendant, so he pulled the police vehicle to the curb, offset from defendant, who was still on the sidewalk. the officers never activated their siren or bullhorn. the officers exited their vehicle and walked toward defendant and the other male. the officers did not any orders or commands. 2 officer pedersen was the witness for the prosecution 4 when approximately eight feet away, officer pedersen dersen approached, affirming the officers could speak to him. defendant removed his or probation. defendant said no and restated the police could not search him. in response, officer pedersen asked defendant if he had any drugs or weapons. defendant said he did

searches. although defendant was not cornered and nothing prevented him from walking away, he assumed by the way the officers approached that he was not free to leave. officer pedersen asked defendant if he was on probation. defendant stated no and handed the officer his wallet. after going through the wallet, officer pedersen began to pat-down defendant, and while doing so asked if defendant had drugs or weapons, trial court findings confronted . . . . but the law under the case of [people v. franklin (1987) 192 cal.app.3d 935 (franklin),] produced by the people suggested the subjected [sic]

unlawful detention.3 defendant argues the officers violated his fourth amendment rights by trial court finds the historical facts, then determines whether the applicable resolution of the factual
