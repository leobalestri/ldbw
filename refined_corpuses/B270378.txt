(veh. code,  10851, subd. (a).) the jury also convicted mr. villeda of making criminal threats (pen. code,  422, subd. (a))1 and ms. wizar of petty theft ( 484, subd. (a), 490.2). the trial court found mr. villeda had served five prior separate prison terms. ( 667.5, subd. (b).) mr. villeda was sentenced to 8 years in state prison. as to ms. wizar, the trial court imposed and suspended a 42-month sentence. ms. wizar was placed on formal probation for 3 years. we affirm the judgments of conviction but remand for resentencing as to mr. villeda. 1 further statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise noted. 3 ii. the evidence a. july 11, 2015 chevy suburban was stolen. his wife, guadalupe gonzalez, had parked the vehicle near . ms. gonzalez left the ignition key inside the unlocked suburban. an hour later, the vehicle was missing. the suburban contained paperwork reflecting mr. neither mr. nor mrs. gonzalez gave mr. villeda or ms. wizar permission to take or drive the car. items ms. gonzalez had left in the vehicle, including two infant car seats, were missing upon its return. b. july 14, 2015 three days later, on july 14, 2015, defendants entered a cvs pharmacy. the pharmacy was two blocks from where the suburban was stolen. ms. wizar was carrying a large reusable shopping bag. a store employee, rene tovar, noted the bag appeared to be empty. mr. tovar lost sight of ms. wizar. he reencountered her standing in an aisle. her shopping bag was full. surveillance videotape showed ms. wizar moving merchandise from the into her bag. but the cameras did not capture the entire aisle. and there was no videotape of ms. wizar putting anything into her clothing. the surveillance cameras also captured mr. villeda taking items off the shelves. john medina, the store manager, saw what looked the shape and 4 size of the boxes made mr. medina think they contained blood pressure monitors worth $100 to $175 each. after mr. tovar confronted her, ms. wizar removed items from her clothing. mr. tovar testiff mr. tovar told an investigating officer, detective elliott kane, that ms. wizar removed merchandise from her pants and also from underneath her shirt. when mr. tovar started yelling for his manger, mr. medina, ms. wizar emptied her shopping bag onto the floor. the bag had contained 25 to 30 items, including cosmetics, hair products ashaving merchandise. mr. tovar testified all of the goods belonged to cvs. according to mr. tovar, ms. wizar never said she intended to pay for the items . mr. medina was less certain. mr. medina did not remember whether ms. wizar had offered to pay for the items. but he vaguely remembered ms. wizar saying she had money. mr. medina further testified ms. wizar may have had money in her hand at the time she made the statement. ms. wizar exited the store but returned briefly. she picked something up from the floor and left again. she got into the and drove away. meanwhile, mr. medina had called an emergency operator. he started to read number to the operator. as he did so, mr. villeda began yelling at mr. medina. mr. medina testified, ] told me [to] get off the fucking phone mr. medina also recalled: [h]e [said he] ing at trial, mr. medina could not recall mr. villeda saying 5 anything about the license plate. but he told detective kane that mr. medina had saidack and mr. medina was walking toward the suburban and reading its license plate number to the emergency operator when ms. wizar drove away. although mr. villeda had appeared to be waiting for ms. wizar outside the store, ms. wizar drove off without him. c. july 15, 2015 the following day, july 15, 2015, officer steve norris was at a chevron gas station located approximately four miles from the cvs pharmacy. officer norris saw ms. wizar exit the suburban and enter the gas market. while in the market, ms. wizar was detained on suspicion of theft. as she was being detained, a male hispanic, later identified as frank sarabia, got out of the suburban. he briefly entered the store and then left. he walked back to the suburban, pretended to pump gas into it, then reentered the vehicle on the front passenger side. officer steven martinez determined the suburban had been stolen. officer norris exited the store to observe the vehicle while officer martinez telephoned for back up. just as the suburban pulled out of the gas station, a police helicopter appeared over head and pursued it. mr. villeda was arrested shortly thereafter. he had been driving the vehicle. there were 67 items inside the suburban with sales stickers attached. there were no purchase receipts for the 6 merchandise. the goods included cosmetics, shampoo, tools and dog leashes. following his arrest, mr. villeda told officer kane he had stolen some deodorant from the cvs pharmacy and concealed it underneath his shirt. mr. villeda denied threatening mr. medina. mr. villeda also said he had purchased the suburban several days earlier. however, he was not able to name the seller. iii. discussion 1. sufficiency of the evidence a. unlawful driving or taking the conviction under vehicle code section 10851, subdivision (a), required proof ms. wizar had a specific intent to permanently or temporarily deprive the owner of title to or possession of the suburban. (veh. code,  10851, subd. (a); people v. moon (2005) 37 cal.4th 1, 26; people v. barrick (1982) 33 cal.3d 115, 134.) ms. wizar challenges the sufficiency of the evidence she had such specific intent. we find substantial s verdict. 7 [w]e review the whole record to determine whether any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime . . . beyond a reasonable doubt. [citation.] the record must disclose substantial evidence to support the verdicti.e., evidence that is reasonable, credible, and of solid valuesuch that a reasonable trier of fact could find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. [citation.] in applying this test, we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution and presume in support of the judgment the existence of every fact the jury could resolve neither credibility issues nor evidentiary conflicts; we upon no hypothesis whatever is there sufficient substantial people v. zamudio (2008) 43 cal.4th 327, 357 ( zamudio ), italics people v. manibusan (2013) 58 cal.4th 40, 87; accord, people v. banks (2014) 59 cal.4th 1113, 1156, overruled on another point in people v. scott (2015) 61 cal.4th 363, 391, fn. 3.) the question of intent is for the trier of fact and may be inferred from circumstantial evidence. ((2007) 153 cal.app.4th 1569, 1577; people v. green (1995) 34 cal.app.4th 165, 181.) knowledge the vehicle is stolen is not an element of the offense, but it may be evidence of the necessary specific intent. (153 cal.app.4th at p. 1574; people v. green, supra, 34 cal.app.4th at p. 180.) also, flight upon apprehension may indicate guilt. (supra, 153 cal.app.4th at pp. 1576-1577; in re robert v. (1982) 8 132 cal.app.3d 815, 821.) the jury was so instructed.2 further, vehicle has been established, possession of the recently taken vehicle by the defendant with slight corroboration through statements or conduct tending to show guilt is sufficient to sustain a conviction of vehicle code section 10851. (in re robert v.[, supra,] 132 cal.app.3d [at pp.] 821-82people v. clifton (1985) 171 cal.app.3d 195, 200; accord, people v. green, supra, 34 cal.app.4th at p. 181; people v. windham (1987) 194 cal.app.3d 1580, 1590.) viewed in the light most favorable to the judgment, the evidence and reasonable inferences therefrom support ms. mr. villeda and ms. wizar were in possession of the suburban for four days after it was stolen from a nearby location. documents inside the vehicle named mr. gonzalez as the owner. and although mr. villeda claimed to have purchased the suburban, he was unable to identify the seller. items belonging to ms. gonzalez, including two infant car seats, had been removed from the vehicle. when the suburban was recovered, it contained multiple items with sales stickers attached but no purchase receipts for the merchandise. the jury could reasonably infer that over the course of four days, defendants, operating as a team, had used the stolen vehicle to 2 immediately after the crime was committed or after (he/she) was accused of committing the crime, that conduct may show that (he/she) was aware of (his/her) guilt. if you conclude that the defendant fled, it is up to you to decide the meaning and importance of that conduct. however, evidence that the 9 commit thefts at nearby stores including the cvs and the gas station market. when confronted, ms. wizar drove the vehicle away to avoid apprehension. ms. wizar drove the suburban away from the cvs pharmacy when mr. medina was reading the . ms. wizar drove away leaving mr. villeda behind. the foregoing was sufficient evidence from which the jury could reasonably conclude ms. wizar had the specific intent to permanently or temporarily deprive the owner of title to or possession of the suburban. b. petty theft the petty theft conviction under sections 484, subdivision (a), and 490.2, required proof that ms. wizar had a specific intent to permanently deprive the owner of the property. (people v. avery (2002) 27 cal.4th 49, 54; people v. davis (1998) 19 cal.4th 301, 305, 307.) ms. wizar challenges the sufficiency of the evidence she had such specific intent. we apply the sufficiency of the evidence standard of review set forth above. we find substantial evidence supported the conviction. first, ms. wizar argues cvs employees made no effort to ascertain whether she intended to pay for the merchandise in her shopping bag. she notes mr. medina could not recall whether she had offered to pay. whether she intended to pay for the items was a question for the jury to determine. (people v. buonauro (1980) 113 cal.app.3d 688, 692; people v. jaso (1970) 4 cal.app.3d shelves and placed them not only in her shopping bag but also in her clothes. the jury could reasonably conclude the only reason ms. wizar would have concealed merchandise in her clothes was 10 because she intended to steal it. moreover, the jury could infer ms. wizar only offered to pay for the items, if at all, after she was caught; if she did offer to pay fpossession, she did so only to avoid prosecution. second, ms. wizar argues there was no theft because she did not remove any cvs property from the store. that contention is without merit. a theft is complete when a defenda(people v. shannon (1998) 66 cal.app.4th 649, 652, 654.) as the court of appeal held in shannonproperty from the store to be convicted of theft of the property from the store. (people v. tijerina (1969) 1 cal.3d 41, 47; people v. buonauro[, supra,] 113 cal.app.3d [at p.] 692, fn. 1.) one need only take possession of the property, detaching it from the store shelves or other location, and move it slightly with the intent to deprive the owner of it permanently. (people v. khoury [(1980)] 108 cal.app.3d supp.[1], 4-people v. shannon, supra, 66 with the intention to appropriate it is sufficient to constitute larceny even though the property may subsequently be returned to the owner . . . . the fact that a thief is prevented by an officer from getting away with the property, or that he may change his mind and return the property to escape prosecution for the crime, does not relieve him from the consequences of the theft. [citations.].id. at p. 656, citing people v. post (1946) 76 cal.app.2d 511, 514.) given the evidence, the jury could reasonably conclude as follows. ms. wizar took items from the storplaced them in her shopping bag and hid then in her clothes with the intent to permanently deprive cvs of the property. she only offered to pay for the stolen items, if at all, 11 after she was caught. if she did so, it was to avoid prosecution. she fled the location when mr. medina telephoned an emergency operation. this was substantial evidence ms. wizar committed petty theft. third, ms. wizar argues she had concealed items in her clothing w for several her pants as cvs merchandise; mr. medina did not see her remove any merchandise from her person; the act was not captured by surveillance cameras; and mr. medina saw items on the floor that may not have belonged to cvs. witness credibility is an issue for the jury to decide. (people v. letner (2010) 50 cal.4th 99, 161-162; people v. hovarter (2008) 44 cal.4th 983, 996.) here, mr. tovar testified he witnessed ms. wizar removing items from her pants. he told detective kane she had removed merchandise from her pants and also from underneath her shirt. the jury could reasonably conclude mr. tovar had no reason to lie. 2. the uncharged act evidence ial attorney, deputy public defender alissa sterling, officer martinez testified as follows. he was in the chevron gas station on july 15, 2015, when an employee approached him. the employee said ms. wizar was stealing items, putting them in her bag and in her jacket. officer martinez and his partner detained ms. wizar for a theft investigation. they found ms. wizar possessed items from a pair of sunglasses and some cans or bottles of soda. 12 ms. wizar argues this was improper propensity evidence and, in allowing it, the trial court abused its discretion and deprived her of a fair trial. irrelevant, included inadmissible hearsay statements of the clerk, and was more prejudicial than probative, allowing the jury to infer from this uncharged alleged act that [ms.] wizar had committed the offenses [at cvs] alleged on july 14, 2015, where evidence of an uncharged criminal act is admissible to ; people v. edwards (2013) 57 cal.4th 658, 711; people v. foster (2010) 50 cal.4th 1301, 1328.) the relevance depends, in part, on whether the act is sufficiently similar to the current charges to support a rational inference of intent, common design, identity, or other material fact. (people v. kipp (1998) 18 cal.4th 349, (between the uncharged act and the charged offense) is required in order to prove intent. [citation.] . . . in order to be admissible to prove intent, the uncharged misconduct must be sufficiently people v.] ewoldt [(1994)] 7 cal.4th [380,] 402.) greater similarity is required to prove the existence of a common design or plan. in such a case, evidence of uncharged misconduct such a concurrence of common features that the various acts are naturally to be explained as caused by a general plan of which ibid.) to 13 committed uncharged criminal acts that are similar to the charged offense may be relevant if these acts demonstrate circumstantially that the defendant committed the charged offense pursuant to the same design or plan he or she used in id. people v. leon (2015) 61 cal.4th 569, 598.) a trial court may exclude uncharged act evidence under outweighed by the probability that its admission will . . . create substantial danger of undue prejudice, of confusing the issues, or ode,  352.) but a defendant cannot seek to exclude relevant evidence merely because it is helpful to the prosecution. (people v. brown (2014) 59 cal.4th 86, 102; people v. doolin (2009) 45 cal.4th 390, 439 [prejudicial under evidence code section 352 not synonymous with damaging].) our supreme court has explaifor purposes of evidence code section 352, evidence is considered unduly prejudicial if it tends to evoke an emotional bias against the defendant as an individual and has a negligible bearing on the issues. (people v. padilla (1995) 11 cal.4th 891, 925[, disapproved on another point in people v. hill (1998) 17 cal.4th 800, 823, fn. 1].) put another way, evidence should be excluded he jury, motivating them to use the information, not to logically evaluate the point upon which it is relevant, but to reward or punish one circumstance, the evidence is unduly prejudicial because of the substantial likelihood the jury will use it for an illegitimate people v. doolin[, supra,] 45 cal.4th [at p.] 14 people v. howard people v. mendoza (2011) 52 cal.4th 1056, 1091-1092.) we sections 352 and 1101 for an abuse of discretion. (people v. leon, supra, 61 cal.4th at p. 597; people v. edwards, supra, 57 cal.4th at p. 711.) a trial court abuses its discretion if it acts in an arbitrary, capricious or patently absurd manner that results in a manifest miscarriage of justice. (people v. foster, supra, 50 cal.4th at pp. 1328-1329; people v. gutierrez (2009) 45 cal.4th 789, 828.) there was no abuse of discretion. the evidence was admissible under evidence code section 1101, subdivision (b). the theft at the gas station market was sufficiently similar to that at the cvs pharmacy to allow a reasonable inference ms. wizar had the same intent on both occasions. her detention at the gas station occurred only one day after the events at cvs. in both cases, ms. wizar entered a store, took items from the shelves and placed them in her clothes and in a bag. in both cases, mr. villeda was also present at or near the scene. the items taken from cvs were similar to those found in the suburban. the evidence supported an inference ms. wizar intended permanently to deprive store owners of property. it supported a finding mr. villeda and ms. wizar were working together and using the stolen suburban to conduct thefts at stores, all within a limited geographic area. (evid. code,  1101, subd. (b); e.g., people v. davidson (2013) 221 cal.app.4th 966, 973.) further, that mr. villeda fled the gas station when ms. wizar was detained was probative of his intent and his 15 consciousness of guilt. the jury was so instructed.3 (people v. abilez (2007) 41 cal.4th 472, 522 [jury could find flight manifested a consciousness of guilt]; people v. bonilla (2007) 41 cal.4th 313, 328-329 [same].) in defense of the petty theft charge, ms. sterling by suggesting she intended to pay for the items. the gas station theft evidence was relevant as tending to disprove that assertion. moreover, the evidence was of a simple alleged theft. that ms. wizar was detained for theft at the gas station market was not ms. wizar because of their emotional reaction. hence it was not unduly prejudicial. the trial court could reasonably conclude the gas station theft evidence was not more prejudicial than probative. even if the trial court had abused its discretion, reversal is not required unless it is reasonably probable the verdict would have been more favorable to ms. wizar absent the uncharged acts evidence. (people v. carter (2005) 36 cal.4th 1114, 1152; people v. kipp, supra, 18 cal.4th at p. 374.) ms. wizar asserts the had committed the offenses alleged . . . where there was in light of the very strong evidence ms. wizar committed the charged crimes, it is not reasonably probable the verdict would have been more favorable to her absent evidence she was detained on suspicion of shoplifting at the gas station. 3 see footnote 3, above. 16 evidentiary ruling rose to the level of a constitutional violation. (people v. lewis (2009) 46 cal.4th 1255, 1289; people v. brown (2003) 31 cal.4th 518, 545.) as our supreme court held in brownnot implicate defenda(people v. brown, supra, 31 cal.4th at p. 545, fn. omitted; accord, people v. mills (2010) 48 cal.4th 158, 194; people v. lewis, supra, 46 cal.4th at p. 1289.) the gas station martinezthat ms. wizar was stealing itemswas inadmissible hearsay. the statement was not offered for the truth. it was offered to show why officer martinez detained ms. wizar.

[] (b) except where subdivision (a) [concerning violent felonies] applies, where the new offense is any felony for which a prison sentence . . . is imposed . . . , in addition and consecutive to any other sentence therefor, the court shall impose a one-year term for each prior separate prison term . . . for any felony; provided that no additional term shall be imposed under this subdivision for any prison term . . . prior to a period of five years in which the defendant remained free of both the commission of an offense which results in a felony conviction, and prison (italics added.) 18 the trial court found defendant had served five prior separate prison terms resulting from the convictions in: 1999, case no. la033094; 2000, case no. la035600; 2002, case no. la039716; 2003, case no. la043435; and 2010, case no. la063517. the trial court imposed five prior separate prison term enhancements. ( 667.5, subd. (b).) mr. villeda contends four of those five enhancements were unauthorized because the underlying felonies had been designated misdemeanors pursuant to proposition 47, section 1170.18, subdivision (f). prior to sentencing, mr. villeda presented evidence in the trial court that his 1999, 2000, 2003 and 2010 convictions had been designated misdemeanors. he argued the misdemeanor convictions did not support section 667.5, subdivision (b) enhancements. the trial court ruled mr. villeda was not a person the voters intended to benefit from proposition 47.4 the trial court erred. pursuant to section 1170.18, subdivision (k), a prior felony conviction designated a apply to a prior felony conviction that has been designated a misdemeanor prior to sentencing on the enhancement.

( 2933.1.) the parties agree the trial court erred. mr. villeda was not convicted of a violent felony. therefore, he was not limited to conduct credit measured as 15 percent of his actual custody credit. ( 2933.1; people v. kimbell (2008) 168 cal.app.4th 904, 908.) mr. villeda was entitled to 218 days of conduct credit. ( 4019, subds.
