(see people v. holmes (2004) 32 cal.4th 432, 440 [when both parties stipulate on the record to a document, such as a police report, the factual basis requirement for the plea is met].) all further statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise indicated. 3 burglary ( 459), one count of grand theft ( 484g, subd.

[] i think based upon that, mr. moor [] . . . [] please take it up on appeal. defense counselagree with the discussion i. proposition 47 and relevant statutes proposition 47, the safe neighborhoods and schools act, was approved by california voters in november 2014. ( 1170.18.) it makes certain drug- and theft-related offenses misdemeanors, unless the offenses were committed by certain ineligible (people v. rivera (2015) 233 cal.app.4th 1085, 1091.) person who has completed his or her sentence for a conviction, whether by trial or plea, of a felony or felonies who would have been guilty of a misdemeanor under this act had this act been in effect at the time of the offense, may file an application before the trial court that entered the judgment of conviction in his or her case to have the felony conviction or convictions designated as misdemeanors proposition 47 created a new crime of shoplifting: notwithstanding section 459 [burglary statute3], shoplifting is defined as entering a commercial establishment with 3 section 459 provides in part: every person who enters any house, room, apartment, tenement, shop, warehouse, store, mill, barn, stable, outhouse or other building, tent, vessel, . . . floating home, . . . railroad car, locked or sealed cargo 5 intent to commit larceny while that establishment is open during regular business hours, where the value of the property that is taken or intended to be taken does not exceed nine hundred fifty dollars ($950). any other entry into a commercial establishment with intent to commit larceny is burglary ( 459.5, subd. (a).) ection 490a, which wherever any law or statute of this state refers to or mentions larceny, embezzlement, or stealing, said law or statute shall hereafter be read and interpreted as if the word theft were substituted therefor section 484, subdivision (a) every person who shall feloniously steal, take, carry, lead, or drive away the personal property of another, or who shall fraudulently appropriate property which has been entrusted to him or her, or who shall knowingly and designedly, by any false or fraudulent representation or pretense, defraud any other person of money, labor or real or personal property, or who causes or procures others to report falsely of his or her wealth or mercantile character and by thus imposing upon any person, obtains credit and thereby fraudulently gets or obtains possession of money, or property or obtains the labor or service of another, is guilty of theft added.) ii. analysis appellant argues the trial court erred in denying his proposition 47 application because he pled no contest to count 1, which stat[establishment] and it is undisputed that fedex suffered no loss. the people do not specifically address this issue. appellant relies on people v. sherow (2015) 239 cal.app.4th 875 (sherow), but this reliance is misplaced. sherow stands for the proposition that a defendant bears the initial burden of demonstrating eligibility for resentencing under proposition 47. (sherow, supra, at p. 880.) the case container, whether or not mounted on a vehicle, trailer coach, . . . any house car, . . . inhabited camper, . . . vehicle as defined by the vehicle code, when the doors are locked, aircraft . . . , or mine or any underground portion thereof, with intent to commit grand or petit larceny or any felony is guilty of burglary 6 does not discuss the situation here, where a defendant enters a commercial establishment with the intent to defraud a different establishment. it is axiomatic that language in a judicial opinion is to be understood in accordance with the facts and issues before the court. an opinion is not authority for propositions not considered.people v. knoller (2007) 41 cal.4th 139, 154155.) appellant cites no other relevant authority to support his position that the shoplifting statute does not apply to the circumstances here, where appellant entered the fedex store with the intent to defraud the westin hotel. the people argue underlying the burglary, or at least the preeminent intended crime under the clearly to send a fax using so the pidentity-theft argument was rejected by the third district in people v. triplett (2016) 244 cal.app.4th 824, 833 (triplett), and we likewise reject it. as the triplett court noted, larceny or theft is defined broadly in section 484, subdivision (a) to include any false or fraudulent representation or pretense [for the purpose to] defraud any other person of money. this is what happened here. as the police report, which moore who fax credit card letter of authorizations to the westin hotel in pasadena, using a credit card account 4 that underlay the commercial burglary offense was larceny, appellant was still not eligible for proposition 47 relief because he did not demonstrate that the amount taken, or attempted to be taken, was the people point out that several credit card authorizations were faxed to the westin hotel from fedex on two different datesseptember 30, 2011, and 4 we note that after the briefs were filed in this case, review was granted in people v. vargas (2016) 243 cal.app.4th 1416 and people v. gonzales (2015) 242 cal.app.4th 35, which also discussed this issue. 7 october 3, 2011. each authorization stated that it was covering all guest charges, but the authorizations listed different departure dates, and stated a different number of nights to be charged. the people argue appellant cannot demonstrate that even a single one of these authorizations resulted in obtaining goods and services less than $950. the problem with this argument is that count 1 only specified the date of october 3, 2011. the other dismissed counts stated various dates, with some counts the record is unclear as to how often the credit cards were charged by the westin hotel, but an e-mail attached to the police report from the assistant front office manager of the westin hotel suggests credit cards were being charged daily. because we cannot tell from the record the amount that was charged to any credit card on october 3, 2011, the matter is remanded to the trial court for a determination of this amount. appellant bears the initial burden of establishing that this amount was less than $950. (sherow, supra, 239 cal.app.4th at p. 880.) disposition the order is conditionally reversed and the matter is remanded to the trial court for a determination of whether the amounts charged by the westin hotel on october 3, 2011, to the credit card used by appellant were less than $950. if so, the order is reversed. if not, the order is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. __________________________, j. ashmann-gerst we concur: _____________________________, p. j. boren ____________________________, j. hoffstadt
