filed 3/3/16 p. v. mcintyre ca2/2 not to be published in the official reports california rules of court, rule 8.1115(a), prohibits courts and parties from citing or relying on opinions not certified for publication or ordered published, except as specified by rule 8.1115(b). this opinion has not been certified for publication or ordered published for purposes of rule 8.1115. in the court of appeal of the state of california second appellate district division two the people, plaintiff and respondent, v. dell mcintyre, defendant and appellant. b263644 (los angeles county super. ct. no. ba403144) appeal from a judgment of the superior court of los angeles county. barbara r. johnson, judge. affirmed with modifications. james r. bostwick, jr., under appointment by the court of appeal, for defendant and appellant. kamala d. harris, attorney general, gerald a. engler, chief assistant attorney general, lance e. winters, senior assistant attorney general, steven e. mercer and paul s. thies, deputy attorneys general, for plaintiff and respondent. * * * * * * 2 dell mcintyre (defendant) appeals his convictions for second-degree robbery and assault by means likely to inflict great bodily injury as well as the resulting 27-year prison sentence. defendant argues that the trial court should have given a self-defense instruction, should have stayed the sentence on his assault conviction under penal code section 654,1 first argument, but find merit with his second and third arguments. we consequently affirm his convictions and order that his sentence be reduced to 23 years with a stayed consecutive sentence of two years on the assault count. facts and procedural background defendant walked up to drew michael (michael)s prescription medication. as defendant walked away, michael started to follow. when michael was about three to six feet behind defendant, michael michael never touched defendant. rned around and punched michael with his fists multiple times; this knocked michael to the ground, broke his nose, and caused a laceration to his chin that necessitated eight stitches. the people charged defendant with (1) second-degree robbery ( 211), and (2) assault by means likely to produce great bodily injury ( 245, subd. (a)(4)). as to both counts, the people alleged that defendant had personally inflicted great bodily injury ( 12022.7, subd. (a)). robbery conviction, his 1999 massachusetts armed assault conviction, and his 1987 massachusetts ( 1170.12, subds. (a)-(d) & 667, subds. (b)-( 667, subd. (a)(1)), and prior prison terms ( 667.5, subd. (b)). the people alleged six other prior prison terms as well. 1 unless otherwise indicated, all further statutory references are to the penal code. 3 the matter proceeded to trial. during closing arguments, the people argued that defendant dish[ed] out to . . . michael the jury convicted defendant of both crimes, and found the great bodily injury allegation to be true. in a birfurcated trial, the court found that the 2002 attempted robbery conviction and the 1999 armed assault found six prior prison terms. the court orally imposed a 27-year sentence and the abstract of judgment reflects that sentence, but the minute order from the sentencing hearing indicates a prison sentence of 23 years and 27 years. the court imposed a 23 year sentence on the robbery count comprised of a 10-year base sentence (five years, doubled as a second strike sentence), plus two five-ee more years for the great bodily injury allegation. as to the assault count, the court orally imposed a consecutive four-year sentence (two years doubled as a second strike sentence), which is reflected in the abstract of judgment and the last part of the minute order. prison priors. defendant timely appeals. discussion i. self-defense instruction defendant argues that his assault conviction must be overturned because the trial court did not instruct the jury on self-defense. we disagree. self- people v. humphrey (1996) 13 cal.4th 1073, 1082.) the reasonable person in the position of [the] defendant . . . .id. at p. 1083, quoting people v. mcgee (1947) 31 cal.2d 229, 238.) a trial court has a duty to instruct on a 4 (people v. villanueva (2008) 169 cal.app.4th 41, 49.) we independently review a trial people v. orlosky (2015) 233 cal.app.4th 257, 270.) we conclude that substantial evidence did not support a self-defense instruction. as noted above, michael did nothing that would cause a reasonable peposition to fear bodily harm of any sort: michael followed defendant and accused him of taking his mediation; michael made that accusation from a distance of three to six feet and without touching defendant. in people v. kranhouse (1968) 265 cal.app.2d 440, 450-451, the court held that a self-defense instruction was not available to a defendant his valise back from the defendant. michael used even less force, and posed even less of a threat of physical harm, than the victim in kranhouse. defendant argues that one of the witnesses saw michael approach defendant in a defenda tel] was no punches or nothing like that. it was like he was accusing him of something is what it notwithstanding that answer, the defense attorney asked the same witness, manner, then you saw the black male turn around and punch the the witne read together, these exchanges do not constitute substantial evidence that the encounter was confrontational, let alone a justification for the beating defendant inflicted. in sum, there was no instructional error. 5 ii. stay of assault conviction under section 654 defendant next argues that the trial court erred in imposing a consecutive sentence on the assault by means likely to cause great bodily injury count rather than staying the sentence under section 654. we agree. sector a people v. capistrano (2014) 59 conduct is divisible and therefore gives rise to more than one act within the meaning of section 654 depends on the intent and objective of the actor. if all of the offenses were incident to one objective, the defendant may be punished for any one of such offenses but not ibid., quoting people v. rodriguez (2009) 47 cal.4th 501, 507; people v. beamon (1973) 8 cal.3d 625, 639-640 (beamon).) the trial court in this case did not address the sn 654 people v. rodriguez (2015) 235 cal.app.4th 1000, 1005.) we conclude there is not substantial evidence to support the finding that defendant acted with a different intent or objective in assaulting michael than he did when taking his medication from fear is not used, robbery requires a use of physical force over and above what is necessary to seize the property taken. (see people v. morales (1975) 49 cal.app.3d 134, people v. burns (2009) 172 cal.app.4th 1251, 1259 [same]; people v. wright (1996) 52 cal.app.4th 203, 210 [same].) here, that bag of medication from michael. (cf. burns, at p. 1resistance and stepped on her foot; sufficient use of force]; people v. prieto (1993) 15 cal.app.4th 210, 215 [defendant and victim physically struggled; sufficient use of force].) indeed, the prosecutor explicitly argued 6 in assaulting the victim is indistinguishable from his intent to commit the robbery and section 654 applies. (see, e.g., in re jesse f. assault is committed as the means of perpetrating a robbery, section 654 requires the sentence for the assault to be stayedbeamon, supraa deadly weapon in the commission of first degree robbery simultaneously assaults the victim with such weapon but clearly may not be punished for both the robbery and assault with a deadly weaponin re henry (1966) 65 cal.2d 330, 330-331 [assault with firearm while robbery in progress; section 654 applies]; people v. niles (1964) 227 cal.app.2d 749, 752-755 [assault with firearm after victim took back property; section 654 applies]; people v. sutton (1973) 35 cal.app.3d 264, 271, fn. 1 (sutton) [assault with firearm while robbery in progress; noting, in dicta, that section 654 applies].)2 the people raise three arguments in response. first, the people contend that the amount of force defendant used on michaels was well in excess of what was needed to establish an independent intpeople v. donohue (1962) 200 cal.app.2d 17, 31.) proof of a further intent is required. thus, in people v. cleveland (2001) 87 cal.app.4th 263, the court affirmed separate punishments for robbery and attempted muid. t is this history which motivated the gratuitous violence supporting the finding of two simultaneous intents also, people v. nguyen (1988) 204 cal.app.3d 181, 185, 190-191 [gratuitous violence was separate from and in addition to force to effectuate robbery; 2 whether section 654 requires a stayed sentence is a separate question than whether the defendant may stand convicted of both crimes. (e.g., people v. logan (1953) 41 cal.2d 279, 290; sutton, supra, 35 cal.app.3d at p. 267.) the latter issue is not before us. 7 multiple punishment permitted].) there is no evidence in the record that defendant harbored a further intent. defendant assaulted michael. this argument is not supported by the record which, as become a robbery until defendant assaulted michael. what matters is the relationship between the robbery and the assault, not the timing of when they occurred vis--vis the end of the robbery. (see people v. estes (1983) 147 cal.app.3d 23, 28 [the crime of robbery is a continuing offense that begins from the time of the original taking until the robber reaches a place of relative lastly, the people argue that defendant assaulted michael with the separate intent to prevent him from sounding the alarm, and cite people v. coleman (1989) 48 cal.3d 112 for support. in coleman, the defendant compelled one woman to help him rob another victim and then proceeded to shoot his helper after he completed the robbery and shot the robbery victim; the court upheld separate punishments for the robbery and id. at pp. 162-163.) unlike in coleman, the robbery and assault victim in this case are one and the same: michael. more to the point, unlike in colemanrobbery; there is no basis for implying a distinct intent to avoid detection. iii. calculation of assault sentence defendant lastly argues that the trial court erred in imposing four years on the assault count. the people agree, and so do we. where, as here, a subordinate crime is a second strike offense, a trial court is to double one-third of the mid-term sentence for that crime. (people v. nguyen (1999) 21 cal.4th 197, 203-204.) because the mid-term sentence for assault by means likely to product great bodily injury is three years ( 245, subd. (a)(4)), doubling one third of that sentence yields a sentence of two years. 8 disposition the convictions are affirmed. the sentence on count 2 is modified to a consecutive term of two years (one-third the middle term, doubled) and is stayed pursuant to section 654. the superior court is directed to forward a certified copy of the corrected abstract of judgment to the department of corrections and rehabilitation. as modified, the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. _______________________, j. hoffstadt we concur: _______________________, p.j. boren _______________________, j. ashmann-gerst
