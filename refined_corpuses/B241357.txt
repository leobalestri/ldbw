(a)),2 six counts of procuring and offering false documents for recording ( 115, subd. (a)), two counts of theft from an elderly person ( 368, subd. (d)), two counts of forgery ( 470, subd. (d)), one count of identity theft ( 530.5, subd. (a)), and two counts 1 hesca was adopted in 1979 to protect homeowners whose residences were in foreclosure from unfair dealings with investors seeking to purchase their properties; it was intended to ensure a homeowner has adequate information to make informed decisions and imposes a number of requirements to protect the homeowner. (see civ. code,  1695.2-1695.6; spencer v. marshall (2008) 168 cal.app.4th 783, 794.) civil code section 1695.8 criminalizes violations of hesca involving fraud or deceit: violates any subdivision of section 1695.6 or who engages in any practice which would operate as a fraud or deceit upon an equity seller shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine of not more than twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000), by imprisonment in the county jail for not more than one year, . . . or by both that fine and imprisonment for each (see people v. shetty (2009) 174 cal.app.4th 1488, 1491.) a violation of civil code section 1695.8 is punishable as either a felony or a misdemeanor. (pen. code,  17, subd. (b); see people v. park (2013) 56 cal.4th 782, 789.) 2 statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise indicated. 3 of first degree residential burglary ( 459). the information specially alleged the crimes were related felonies involving the taking of more than $500,000 ( 186.11, subd. (a)) and barnett had suffered two prior serious or violent felony convictions within the meaning of the three strikes law ( 667, subds. (b)-(i), 1170.12, subds. (a)-(d)). barnett pleaded not guilty and denied the special allegations. 2. prior to trial barnett was represented by private attorney winston mckesson from the time of his arrest in april 2010 through june 2011 when mckesson was replaced by amy konstantelos. in mid-november 2011 barnett wrote two letters to the trial court expressing he told the court he had no money to pay konstantelos and was worried she did not have time to meet with him to discuss the case. konstantelos had told him that without financial resources she could not represent him effectively.3 barnett said he had asked both of his retained attorneys if a state-appointed attorney would be better for all concerned, but they had recommended against it. he emphasized he did not want to delay his trial but explained in the five months he had been represented by konstantelos he had yet to speak with her about the case or receive any documents related to his case. based on her lack of preparation and the possibility he would spend the rest of his life in prison, he believed he needed appointed counsel and asked the court to assign one. the court december 1, 2011 pretrial conference, which had been scheduled before barnett wrote his letters. the court stated compensation. konstantelos told the court she barnett because she was not being paid and had been forced to take on other matters to keep her practice afloat. she stated, however, she understood her responsibility and thought she could still be ready for trial. barnett interrupted konstantelos to say he did not want her to feel obligated when 3 barnett stated he had paid mckesson approximately $25,000 before mckesson withdrew. barnett had paid $2,500 to konstantelos. 4 her. . . mmunication with her and i. and with all due . . . after expressing concern a change of attorney would result in a delay of the trial datewhich had not yet been setand hardship for the elderly witnesses, the court asked whether barnett wanted to discharge his counsel. barnett answered by referring the court to the letters he had written. t . . if i can get a state appointed the court asked the prosecutor for a response; the prosecutor asked, if there were to be a delay, the court then observedthe other thing that came to mindtically frowned is to appoint the lawyer who takes the case privately and then have her appointed as a public lawyer. . . s and then turning around and then putting them on the public payroll. . . . counsel . . . . . . ago and spoke to the clerk . . . . i said could you let the judge know, and if i need to come early before today, we can schedule a motion, she responded she was not asking to be relieved because she believed she was . . . 5 else i can rto allow time to research the question, the court set a follow-up hearing for the following week. on december 9, 2011 the court reconvened the hearing and announced there was no ground to appoint konstantelos as harris counsel.4 the court also stated it had decided there were no grounds to remove konstantelos on economic grounds, concluding, the trial could begin on february 8, 2012 but realized that date would push the trial to the end of the 70-day limitation. the court asked barnett if he would waive his right to a speedy trial, and barnett agreed. the trial was set for february 8, 2012 and began on february 17, 2012. 3. the evidence at trial aloccurred prior to trial, we summarize the evidence of the complex real estate transactions preparation and his request to replace her with state-appointed counsel.5 barnett owned a real estate loan brokerage company known as trusperity acquisition corporation that also operated at times under the names buyers market realty services (bmrs) and dealpoint investments. in 2005 trusperity began processing home equity sales transactions. barnett oversaw those transactions and trained his staff to identify homeowners in default on secured loans who might be interested in a home equity sales contract. as his employees testified, barnett, who is african-american, referred to hispanics and african-on the hispanic and black populations in south los angeles and compton 4 in harris v. superior court (1977) 19 cal.3people v. lancaster (2007) 41 cal.4th 50, 70, fn. 5.) harris did lancaster, at p. 71, fn. 6.) 5 the evidence at trial was introduced by the people. barnett did not testify or present any witnesses. 6 . . . although trusperity used templates approved by an attorney for these transactions, when customers came into the office to sign the printed forms, they rarely read what they were signing. the charges in this case arose from five home equity sales contracts solicited and implemented by barnett: a. the baker transaction eddie baker bought his south los angeles home in 1969. in 2004 he borrowed $206,000, an amount secured by a deed of trust on the property. by june 2005 he had fallen behind in his payments, and the company holding the deed of trust filed a notice of default. barnett appeared at his house and told baker he could help baker pay his arrears and repair his credit. after several meetings baker signed an equity purchase agreement loan, and pay baker $12,000. on july 6, 2005 baker also signed a grant deed transferring title to barnett and a lease indicating he would pay a monthly rent of $1,000 to barnett for the next three years. the lease contained an option clause, guaranteeing baker the right to buy back the house for $251,000 at any time during the second year of the lease term. if he failed to exercise the option, however, it would terminate. baker later testified he did not understand he had sold his house to barnett and did not read all the papers because he trusted barnett, who seemed professional, treated baker well and was a christian. barnett also had baker sign escrow instructions reflecting a sale price of $440,000, to be funded by a loan of $352,000. an amendment to the escrow instructions directed the escrow company to wire the proceeds from the sale to bmrs. in mid-july 2005 this escrow was cancelled and re-opened with new instructions indicating a sale price of secured loan). trusperity deposited funds to cover the costs specified in the new escrow instructions but, on the same day, recorded the grant deed signed by baker that reflected the price of $440,000, as specified in the original escrow instructions. barnett then opened a third escrow account. on july 7 three days later. kimberly) obtained a loan from anchor mortgage (anchor) for $285,000 secured by a loan, as well as escrow and title fees, trusperity received $45,639.92 from the loan proceeds. in september 2005 trusperity entered into an agreement to sell the home to derry hood for $440,000. an escrow account was opened for the transaction with a different company. the escrow instructions indicated the purchase price would be funded by a $352,000 loan secured by a first deed of trust and an additional loan of $66,000 secured by a second deed of trust. barnett deposited $27,000 into escrow for the benefit of hood. when the escrow closed and the loans were funded, the anchor loan of $285,000 was paid off. after deducting closing costs, the escrow company wired barnett the balance of $136,975.94. after the sale to hood, baker began receiving mail at his house addressed to hood. baker called barnett and asked him about the letters. barnett told baker not to worry and that he would take care of it. barnett also told baker hood was a former sought legal assistance. b. the iverson transaction billie mae iverson bought her compton home in 1967. in 1988 she borrowed $88,000 from aames home loan secured by a trust deed recorded against the property. in 1997 she borrowed $25,000 from wells fargo similarly secured by a trust deed , and by 2005 she was behind on her payments to wells fargo. on september 14, 2005 a notice of default was recorded against the property. on september 15, 2005 a munderstood she was having financial problems with her house. he told iverson he had a brother in real estate who had helped many other people in the area. barnett showed up at the house an hour later. iverson told barnett she only wanted a reverse mortgage, and barnett replied he had a better program. barnett explained the program, but iverson 8 testified at trial she did not understand any of the details. iverson repeatedly told barnett she did not want to sell her home, and barnett assured her she would not lose her home. iverson believed she would receive monthly income from her equity until her death. she signed multiple documents while barnett was at her home, later saying barnett earned her trust by saying he was a christian and professing his desire to help people. iverson, barnett said, reminded him of his mother. one of the documents iverson signed was an equity purchase agreement providing barnett would purchase the home for $104,000, subject to the existing first and second trust deeds. she also signed a lease under which barnett became her landlord. the lease contained an option provision, granting iverson the right to buy the property back for $100,000 during the second year of the lease. the lease required iverson to pay barnett $1,470 each month. she also signed a consent for barnett to sell or encumber the house during the lease period. an escrow account for the transaction was opened, and iverson signed instructions providing barnett would purchase the home for $250,000 (later amended to $266,500) and finance the sale with a loan subject to a deed of trust. barnett obtained a loan from anchor. on september 16, 2005 iverson signed a grant deed transferring the property to barnett, which he recorded. iverson also signed a consent for the escrow company to disburse the proceeds from the sale of her home to barnett with the exception of $6,000 to be paid directly to iverson. after the escrow closed and the original trust deed holders had been paid, the escrow company disbursed $6,000 to iverson and $139,064.03 to barnett. in january 2006 an escrow account was opened with a different escrow company for the sale of the property from barnett to robbie odom for $400,000. funding in the amount of $378,793.50 was obtained from silver state financial, which was used to pay the existing anchor secured loan of $271,411.26. after deducting closing costs, the escrow company disbursed $112,112.85 to barnett and $284.78 to odom. a grant deed signed by barnett transferred the property to odom on january 23, 2006. 9 after the sale, called barnett, who told her odom was a business associate. on august 21, 2007 a notice of default indicating odom was delinquent on his loan was recorded against the houselegal assistance, and a lawsuit was filed on her behalf. as a result odom quit-claimed the property to iverson. c. the hitchens transaction tohnnie ray hitchens and his elderly mother, ruby lee harris, purchased their income decreased, and he fell behind on payments. on october 7, 2005 a notice of default was recorded against their home indicating a delinquency of $4,750.12. several days later hitchens arrived home to find his mother missing. soon barnett drove up to the home with harris in the car. barnett introduced himself, saying he understood their property was in default and he was there to help them. harris had documents in her possession barnett had given her. barnett offered to purchase the property for $60,000. hitchens owed $65,000 on the house and did not want to sell. barnett told hitchens he would have to make a quick decision and left. hitchens met with barnett and explained he wanted to save his home, not sell it. barnett agreed to help hitchens refinance the house and pay off the existing loan. hitchens signed multiple documents provided by barnett, still believing he was refinancing his home. hitchens trusted him because barnett was a christian, african-american, as he was, and had stressed his ethical values. escrow instructions created for the transaction indicated hitchens would obtain a loan for $90,000. hitchens signed a note secured by a deed of trust on the property stating he had borrowed $15,000 from bmrs and would repay it by november 21, 2005. he also signed a deed of trust securinharris signed a deed transferring her interest in the home to her son to facilitate the search for a loan. 10 several months later barnett informed hitchens he had been unable to find a lender because hitchens did not qualify for new financing. barnett suggested instead he purchase the home from hitchens, qualify himself for a secured loan and then reconvey the home to hitchens in 45 days. barnett told hitchens this was a customary real estate procedure. hitchens agreed. new escrow instructions were prepared stating hitchens would sell his house to barnett for $230,000. on february 13, 2006 hitchens signed a grant deed transferring the property to barnett. anchor agreed to fund the transaction through a hard money loan with a one-year term. hitchens was unaware of these terms. on february 15, 2006 the sale closed. after the original wells fargo loan was repaid, $15,000 was also paid to bmrs. after closing costs were deducted, $7,000 was disbursed to hitchens, and $131,202.47 was disbursed to barnett. despite his promise to reconvey the property to hitchens, barnett failed to do so. hitchens sought legal assistance when barnett did not respond to him and eventually won his house back. however, he was unable to pay off the debt, was forced into foreclosure, and the house was sold. d. the king transaction dorothy king bought her south los angeles home in 1964. while suffering from dementia in 2004, she obtained several loans, including one for $235,000, secured by trust deeds on the property. on december 5, 2005 a notice of default was recorded stating king was delinquent on one of those loans. on december 7, 2005 king signed an equity purchase agreement to sell her home to barnett for $288,500. she also signed a disclosure form indicating she understood she had equity in the home in excess of the purchase price but that the offer was best suited to her needs and goals. an escrow account was opened to process the sale at a price of $300,000. amendments to the instructions indicated king would pay all closing costs and that all proceeds were to be wired to barnett. on december 31, 2005 barnett borrowed $301,000 from anchor, again in the form of a hard money loan with a balloon payment at the end of a year. king signed a deed transferring the property to barnett and a lease with a term of three years and a monthly rent of $1,000. the lease gave king the right to 11 repurchase the home during the second year of the lease term for $396,000. after closing, including repayment of the 2004 loans, the escrow company distributed the balance of $34,186 to barnett. in january 2006 another escrow account was opened to process sale of the home to odom at a price of $427,600, funded by loans of $360,000 and $67,500. the sale price was subsequently adjusted to $450,000, and odom deposited $27,296 to make up the difference. on january 24, 2006 barnett signed a deed transferring odom. on march 1, 2006 odom borrowed $315,000 secured by a first deed of trust and an additional $112,500 secured by a second deed of trust. after closing, barnett netted $119,310.80 from the sale. allen, a real estate professional, learned of the foreclosure and accompanied her aunt to file a complaint with the department of consumer affairs. allen filed a lis pendens on the property in january 2007; and, in response, barnett filed an unlawful detainer against king to evict her from her home. the parties mediated the dispute and reached an agreement that required barnett and odom to make payments on the secured loans, but the payments were never made. after a notice of default was recorded in august 2007, king sued. the property was returned to her, but the encumbrances remained. e. the sedwick/lewis transaction freddie marie sedwick purchased her south los angeles home in 1990. in 2005 she added her daughter kimberly lewis to the title. in december 2005 sedwick and lewis refinanced the home with a $330,000 loan from countrywide home loans. in july 2006 they obtained a home equity line of credit of $24,000, also secured by a deed of trust, from orion equity credit to finance improvements to the home. by december 2006 they were in default on the orion loan, and a foreclosure sale was set for april 24, 2007. a trusperity employee came to the home and told lewis trusperity could help resolve their financial issues. lewis met with barnett in his office. barnett told her he could help and could be trusted because he was a christian. although barnett first told 12 lewis he would help her get a loan, he eventually told her to do so he would have to put lack of options, ultimately agreed. she and sedwick signed documents acknowledging their property would be brought out of foreclosure by barnett and sold as a regular residential property; verifying sedwick was of sound mind and competent to enter the transaction; and affirming they had read the documents and were not under duress or undue influence. they also signed an equity purchase agreement to sell the property to gregory matta (at the same address as other equity purchasers identified by barnett), who would obtain loans totaling $570,000. an escrow account was opened in april 2007 identifying the sale price of the property as $570,000. lewis and sedwick signed a document waiving their rights under hesca to rescind the sale within two years if the purchaser took unconscionable advantage of them and a lease requiring them to pay rent of $1,395 for two years. the lease contained a purchase option at the price of $525,000 to be exercised during the ght to sell or encumber the property. barnett told lewis he would refinance the home and she would be able to get the house back in her name. on may 9, 2007 countrywide recorded a notice of default against the property, and lewis learned barnett had failed to make the promised payments on the loan. when confronted, barnett told lewis the original buyer did not have his finances together and barnett would proceed with a different buyer. he opened a new escrow account identifying dealpoint investments as the buyer, and sedwick and lewis signed a grant deed transferring their property to dealpoint. they also signed amended escrow instructions directing that all proceeds from the sale be disbursed to dealpoint at the close of escrow. the price of the property was reduced to $416,000, to be funded by a $250,000 loan and a loan from lewis and sedwick to the buyers of $166,000. a representative of dealpoint executed a note promising to pay lewis $166,000 by december 1, 2007 and a deed of trust securing the note. 13 anchor funded the $250,000 loan on july 5, 2007. nearly $50,000 of that loan went to pay the orion loan (including penalties and interest), and the escrow company disbursed the remaining $180,245.82 to dealpoint. the countrywide loan was not paid. in late 2007 lewis learned barnett had not been making payments to countrywide. he claimed he had no money and asked her to wire him $6,000. she then learned her home was in foreclosure and confronted barnett because her mother had nowhere to go if forced out of the house. barnett told her he did not want to hear it because she had entered the transaction and knew what she was doing. sedwick died in march 2010, and lewis was ultimately evicted from the property. f. the breakdown of profits on the equity sales real estate expert dean cloud reviewed the transactions and determined the homeowner victims received the following amounts for the sale of their homes: baker$12,000; hitchens$7,000; iverson$6,000; king$0; and sedwick$0. according to cloud, barnett collected $182,615.86 for the baker transaction; $131,202.47 for the hitchens transaction; $251,176.88 for the iverson transaction; $153,496.80 for the king transaction; and $180,245.82 for the sedwick transaction. cloud further opined none of the homeowners would have lost their homes at foreclosure if they had not entered the equity purchase agreements with barnett because of the positive equity in their homes. 4. the verdicts and sentencing the jury convicted barnett of five counts of illegal purchase of equity in real property, five counts of theft of real property, six counts of procuring and offering false documents for recording, and one count of theft from an elderly person.6 it also found the offenses were related fraudulent felonies involving the taking of more than $500,000. the trial court found barnett had suffered two prior serious or violent felony convictions within the meaning of the three strikes law but granted his motion to dismiss one prior conviction with respect to all counts except count 13 for theft from an elderly person. for that count the court sentenced barnett to an indeterminate state prison term 6 barnett was acquitted on the forgery and burglary charges. 14 of 25 years to life and imposed consecutive, determinate terms totaling 8 years 4 months on four of the five counts of theft of real property, plus the enhancement for taking more than $500,000 in related felonies.7 it stayed imposition of sentence on the remaining counts under section 654. discussion 1. the right to discharge retained counsel n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the

[but] right now and despite what [barnett] indicates, you will be the lawyer including his letters to the court, barnett repeated his request for appointment of counsel on three occasions. he clearly believed he would receive a less-than-adequate defense unless new counsel was appointed , of course, legitimate, but the court appeared to seize upon the possibility of paying konstantelos to continue as counsel,8 a proposition it investigated but denied a week later without returning to 8 as discussed, after listeni 19 to paraphrase lara, was still willing to proceed to trial despite his disagreements with [konstantelos]. such an inquiry would have settled the issue as to whether [barnett] was still unsatisfied with representation.lara, supra, 86 cal.app.4th at p. 158.) whether konstantelos performance at trial was adequateand barnett contends it was nothis situation mirrored the concerns articulated by the supreme court in people v. ortiz, supra, 51 cal.3d at page the risk in compelling a defendant to go to trial with unpaid counsel against his wishes and those of his attorney, is that thget what he paid for. in accord with her ethical duty, but by her own admission she had been forced to spend time on other matters precisely because she was not being paid. b. that the court did not abuse its discretion by lacks merit. we have found no case in which e than two months before trial was found to be untimely.
