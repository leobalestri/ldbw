filed 10/10/19 p. v. orozco ca2/2 not to be published in the official reports california rules of court, rule 8.1115(a), prohibits courts and parties from citing or relying on opinions not certified for publication or ordered published, except as specified by rule 8.1115(b). this opinion has not been certified for publication or ordered published for purposes of rule 8.1115. in the court of appeal of the state of california second appellate district division two the people, plaintiff and respondent, v. serviano orozco, defendant and appellant. b292926 (los angeles county super. ct. no. ba455549) appeal from an order of the superior court of los angeles county. craig richman, judge. reversed. adrian k. panton under appointment by the court of appeal, for defendant and appellant. xavier becerra, attorney general, lance e. winters, senior assistant attorney general, steven e. mercer and david a. voet, deputy attorneys general, for plaintiff and respondent. * * * * * * 2 the trial court even though it was undisputed that the reason the defendant never reported was because he was involuntarily deported. this was error, so we reverse. facts and procedural background on april 10, 2017, serviano orozco (defendant) pled guilty to a felony count of transporting methamphetamine (health & safety code,  11379). the trial court placed him on three years of formal probation, which included 180 days in the county jail. to the [probation office] . . . within 48 hours of [his] release[] [the] [p]robation [office] advised of [his] home, work address, and telephone numbers at all times. upon his release from the county jail on may 4, 2017, defendant was deported to mexico. as a consequence, defendant to the probation office. more than 15 months later, in august 2018, the probation [d] and had not paid the outstanding fine of $4,050.00.1 at an august 24, 2018 hearing, the trial court noted that t[d] never probation at this point in time and issu[ed] a no-bail 1 the fines originally imposed against defendant came only to $420, so we surmise the remaining $3,630 are the costs of probation. 3 . . . defendant filed this timely appeal. discussion defendant argues that the trial court erred in summarily revoking his probation. we review this claim for an abuse of discretion. (people v. galvan (2007) 155 cal.app.4th 978, 981-982 (galvan).) the trial court abused its discretion in summarily revoking was people v. leiva (2013) 56 cal.4th 498, 504- . . . probation violation must be willful to justify revocation (people v. gonzalez (2017) 7 cal.app.5th 370, 382, overruled on another point as stated in people v. deleon (2017) 3 cal.5th 640, 646; people v. moore (2012) 211 cal.app.4th 1179, 1186; see also people v. hall probation typically requires proof that the probation violation ) where, as here, a defendant is involuntarily deported, his subsequent failure to report to the probation office is not willful and hence cannot provide the basis for revoking his probation. (galvan, supra, 155 cal.app.4th at pp. 983-984; people v. cervantes (2009) 175 cal.app.4th 291, 295-297 (cervantes); see also people v. maya (2019) 33 cal.app.5th 266, 271 [so noting].) revoking probation in this situation is an abuse of discretion necessitating reversal. (cervantes, at p. 295.) 4 the people resist this conclusion. the people cite language from people v. campos (1988) 198 cal.app.3d 917 stating that in violation of that probation for failure to report to the probation department although his deportation makes it impossible for the defendant to fulfill this condition id. at 923.) this language is impossible to square with the above cited precedent requiring that violations of probation be willful, precedent our supreme court recently cited with approval in hall. the people alternatively urge that, even if deportation prevented him from reporting to the probation office, we should still affirm the order summarily revoking because defendant willfully failed to comply with other conditions of probation unaffected by his deportation to mexiconamely, his failure to advised of [his] home, work address, and telephone number at all and his failure to pay his fines. this argument ignores provide current contact information as a basis for revocation (see people v. bauer (2012) 212 cal.app.4th 150, 156, fn. 2 [due process demands that proper notice be given of grounds for probation violations]), ignores that it would have been nigh impossible to provide that information absent the initial assignment to a particular probation officer (and his deportation prevented that assignment), and ignores that there was also no ev 5 disposition the order is reversed. not to be published in the official reports. ______________________, j. hoffstadt we concur: _________________________, acting p. j. ashmann-gerst _________________________, j. chavez
