(b)). in both actions, appellant pleaded not guilty and denied the special allegations. prior to the consolidation of the actions, they were assigned to the same judge, and appellant was represented by the same court-appointed defense counsel. appellant filed motions for pretrial discovery pursuant to pitchess v. superior court (1974) 11 cal.3d 531. in case no. pa077747, the trial court granted the motion with respect to two police officers, but determined that there were no discoverable materials. in case no. pa078593, the court granted the motion with respect to two different police officers, determined there were discoverable materials, and directed their disclosure to defense counsel. in january 2015, in case no. pa078593, appellant filed a motion for dismissal of the gang allegations, which the trial court denied. on march 3, 2015, the trial court denied appellants motion under people v. marsden (1970) 2 cal.3d 118 for a new court-appointed attorney. later, the court information in case no. pa077747 to include the five counts alleged in the information in case no. pa078593, which were renumbered as counts four through eight. on march 12, 2015, appellant entered into a plea agreement under which he was to be given a total term of 14 years and 4 months in state prison. in accordance with the agreement, appellant pleaded nolo contendere to the charges 4 of possession of a controlled substance for sale (count one) and possession of a firearm with a prior conviction for a violent offense (count four). in addition, he admitted the truth of the gang allegation accompanying count four, and the existence of a 1994 robbery conviction constituting a strike under the three strikes law and a serious felony ( 667, subd. (a)(1)). as provided in the plea agreement, the trial court imposed the three-year upper term on count four and a consecutive eight-month term on count one (one-third the middle term), doubled those terms pursuant to the three strikes law, and added a two-year gang enhancement ( 186.22, subd. (b)(1)(b)) and a five-year prior serious felony conviction enhancement ( 667, subds. (a)(1), (a)(4), 1192.7, subd.

(people v. johnson (2009) 47 cal.4th 668, 676.) a defendant must obtain a certificate of probable cause (pen. code, 1237.5) to attack the plea agreement itself or the sentence imposed, insofar as the challenge goes to an aspect of the sentence to which the defendant agreed as an integral part of [the] plea agreement. (people v. johnson, supra, 47 cal.4th at p. 678.) in the absence of a certificate of probable cause, a defendant may contend only (1) that a motion to suppress evidence was improperly denied, or (2) that after the plea, errors occurred in the subsequent adversary hearings conducted by the trial court for the purpose of determining the degree of the crime and the penalty to be imposed. (people v. brown (2010) 181 cal.app.4th 356, 360, quoting people v. ward (1967) 66 cal.2d 571, 574.) aside from asserting an intent to challenge the validity of the plea, notice of appeal states that the appeal is based a motion to suppress evidence under . . . section 1538.5 the sentence or other matters occurring in requesting a certificate of probable cause to 6 attack the validity of the plea, appellant alleged violations of his federal constitutional rights. in addition, he contended that he received ineffective assistance from his counsel because she failed to challenge the search of his house, appeal is limited to hat do not challenge the validity of people v. cuevas (2008) 44 cal.4th 374, 379), as no motion under section 1538.5 people v. hunter (2002) 100 cal.app.4th 37, 41), and the trial court denied his request for a certificate of probable cause (cuevas, supra, 44 cal.4th at p. 379). that limitation on the appeal reflects the principle that [w]hen a guilty [or nolo contendere] plea is entered in exchange for specified benefits such as the dismissal of other counts or an agreed maximum punishment, both parties . . . must abide by the terms of the agreement. (id. at p. 383, quoting people v. panizzon (1996) 13 cal.4th 68, 80.) as sentence was imposed in accordance with the plea agreement, our review of the record discloses no arguable error within the scope of the appeal. lleges numerous errors prior to his plea, the only contention potentially subject to our review is that his sentence contravened proposition 36, which amended the three strikes law. that contention fails because the trial court correctly applied the amended three strikes law in in entering the pleas of nolo contendere, appellant admitted that in 1994, he was convicted of robbery ( 211), which constitutes a violent felony ( 667.5, subd. (c)(9)), for purposes of the amended three strikes law ( 667, subd. (d)(1), 1170.17, subd. (b)(1)). in view of that prior conviction, the amended three strikes law authorized the court to double the terms for counts 1 and 4 ( 667, subd. (e)(1), 1170.12, subd. (c)(1)). we 7 therefore conclude that responsibilities and that no arguable issues exist.
