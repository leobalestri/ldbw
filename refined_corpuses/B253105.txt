(pen. code,  594, subd. (a).) at trial, lopez and her friend sara valencia testified that they saw murga scratch lopezs truck. at the close of this evidence the court denied murgas motion for acquittal, finding the evidence, which included photographs and the testimony of lopez and valencia, was sufficient to sustain a conviction. (pen. code,  1118.1.) murga and her fianc, osvaldo arana, then testified arana picked up their children from school on the day of the vandalism, and murga was not at the school that day and did not vandalize lopezs truck. murga was convicted and sentenced to serve 34 days in county jail and was placed on three years of formal probation. the court awarded murga 17 days actual custody credit and 17 days good time/work time credit. she paid $1,200.00 in restitution (pen. code,  1202.4, subd.

(pen. code,  1202.44.) murga timely appealed. we appointed counsel to represent her on appeal, and after examination of the record, appointed counsel filed an opening brief raising no issues and asking this court to independently review the record. (people v. wende (1979) 25 cal.3d 436, 441-442.) on april 22, 2014, we sent letters to murga and appointed counsel, directing counsel to forward the appellate record to murga and advising murga that within 30 days she could personally submit any contentions or issues she wished us to consider. to date she has not responded. 3we have examined the entire record and find no arguable issue exists. we are therefore satisfied that murgas attorney complied with her responsibilities and affirm the judgment. (people v. wende, supra, 25 cal.3d at p. 441.) disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published. chaney, j. we concur: rothschild, p. j. johnson, j.
