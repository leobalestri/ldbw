(defendant), paul lopez (lopez) and dayvon andrew brazile (brazile) are all members of the whittier, california-based jim town gang. between 2004 and 2014, defendant lived with his family in jim town gang territory; his next door neighbors were richard mationg (mationg), defendant and mationg used to get along, in the years prior to 2014, they argued and occasionally got into fist fights. around 9 p.m. on may 10, 2014, mationg and his father were sitting on their front porch drinking beer. a car screeched to a halt in front of the mationg residence, and lopez, brazile car and, as they walked across the 3 front porch out into the middle of the street. the other men followed. soon thereafter, defendant came out of his house. although it is not clear whether a fist fight broke out between the three men and mationg before defendant joined, defendant and mationg traded taunts and punches. when mationg started to hold his own against his assailants, defendant backed away, pulled out a gun and aimed it ng defendant then got into a car with the others and drove off. ii. procedural background the people charged defendant with murder (pen. code,  187, subd. (a)).1 the people further alleged that the murder principal in the crime had discharged a firearm causing death ( 12022.53, subds. (d) & (e)(1)). the trial court instructed the jury on the crimes of first degree murder, second degree murder and voluntary 1 the people also charged lopez and brazile with murder, charged lopez with assault with a firearm ( 245, subd. (a)(2)) and charged brazile with voluntary manslaughter ( 192, subd. (a)). the other defendants were tried separately, and are not part of this appeal. all further statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise indicated. 4 manslaughter (as a lesser included offense due to imperfect self-defense and due to provocation / heat of passion as well as on perfect self-defense.2 the jury found defendant guilty of second degree murder, and found true both the firearm and gang allegations. the trial court sentenced defendant to prison for 40 years to life. this sentence was comprised of a base sentence of 15 years to life for the second degree murder count plus 25 years to life for the firearm enhancement. the court struck the gang enhancement for purposes of sentencing. the court also imposed direct restitution of $12,563.70 to the mationg family and $7,000 imposed a $300 restitution fine, a $30 criminal conviction assessment and a $40 court operations assessment. defendant filed a timely notice of appeal. discussion i. instructional issues defendant argues that the trial court erred in instructing the jury because (1) the court did not instruct the jury on imperfect defense of otherseffectively prevented the jury from convicting him of the lesser included crime of voluntary manslaughter. we independently review claims of instructional error. (people v. posey (2004) 32 cal.4th 193, 218.) 2 the trial court also instructed the jury on the lesser included offense of involuntary manslaughter, but later instructed the jury to disregard that instruction. 5 a. imperfect defense of others if a criminal defendant unlawfully kills another person someone else] . . . [was in] imminent danger of death or great (so-called imperfect self-defense or imperfect defense of others), he is guilty of voluntary manslaughter rather than murder. (people v. michaels (2002) 28 cal.4th 486, 528 (michaels); people v. randle (2005) 35 cal.4th 987, 997.) because voluntary manslaughter is a lesser included offense to murder (people v. barton (1995) 12 cal.4th 186, 200-201), a trial court is required to instruct a jury on imperfect self-defense or imperfect which a reoffense [of voluntary manslaughter], but not the greater [offense people v. cruz (2008) 44 cal.4th 636, 664; people v. hughes (2002) 27 cal.4th 287, 366-367, italics any evidence people v. flannel (1979) 25 cal.3d 668, 684, fn. 12.) in assessing whether substantial evidence exists to support a lesser included offense instruction, we construe the record in the light most favorable to the defendant. (people v. millbrook (2014) 222 cal.app.4th 1122, 1137.) the trial court did not err in declining to instruct the jury on voluntary manslaughter based on the imperfect defense of others because there was not substantial evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that defendant, in shooting mationg, actually but unreasonably believed that anyone else people v. nguyen (2015) 61 cal.4th 1015, 1066.) at the time defendant joined the fight, there was either no ongoing fist fight or a fist 6 fellow gang members; in either instance, the gang members were defendant himself then joined or started a fist fight with mationg and, after a brief melee, backed away, pulled out a gun, and shot mationg in the chest. these facts all but defeat the inference that defendant harbored any belief in the necessity to intervene to protect anyone else from imminent danger of death or great was no direct evidence of such a belief. defendant makes what amount to two arguments to the contrary. first, he asserts that there was substantial evidence that he actually believed that his fellow gang members were in imminent danger of death or great bodily injury because police recovered an empty knife sheath in matifound the corresponding knife beneath a staircase inside of mationg with a knife before or during the fist fight. to the contrary, moments before mationg was shot, he was balling his fists at his sidesomething he could only do if he was unarmed. it is also undisputed that neither defendant nor any of his fellow gang members ever saw the knife or its sheath at any point that evening. the involvement of a knife in the melee is purely (people v. ramon (2009) 175 cal.app.4th 843, 851). defendant seeks to avoid this conclusion by asserting that the people never proved he could not see the knife sheath and that his counsel argued the knife was at play in his closing argument. these further arguments lack merit because neither the absence of 7 evidence nor the argument of counsel constitutes evidence, let alone substantial evidence. (roddenberry v. roddenberry (1996) 44 cpeople v. redd (2010) 48 second, defendant posits that the trial court should have instructed the jury to consider his long history of animosity with mationg in evaluating his claim of imperfect defense of others. threats or assaults by the victim conductpeople v. gonzalez (1992) 8 cal.app.4th 1658, 1663-1664, italics added and deleted; people v. minifie (1996) 13 cal.4th 1055, 1065-1066; people v. moore (1954) 43 cal.2d 517, 528-529.) thus, such an instruction may be necessary when instructing on perfect self-defense or defense of others, which (people v. rodarte (2014) 223 cal.app.4th 1158, 1170-1171.) but it is wholly irrelevant where, as here, the issue is imperfect self-defense or defense of others, for which the reasonableness of a -defense is irrelevant. (michaels, supra, 28 cal.4th at p. 528.) b. removal of voluntary manslaughter from consideration explicitly defined ci- 8 people v. lasko (2000) 23 cal.4th 101, 108, citing  192 (lasko); people v. blakeley (2000) 23 cal.4th 82, 87-88.) what differentiates murder from voluntary manslaughter is the element of malice aforethought: a defendant who commits an unlawful killing while acting under the heat of passion or laboring under an actual but unreasonable belief in the need for self-defense (or defense of others) is deemed to be acting without malice aforethought. (people v. rangel (2016) 62 cal.4th 1192, 1226; lasko, at pp. 109-110.) the jury instructions in this case, while wordier than they needed to be, correctly conveyed the above stated law. using caljic nos. 8.10 and 8.11, the jury was instructed that (1) performed with knowledge of the danger to, and with conscious largely parallels caljic nos. 8.10 and 8.11, the jury was kill[ing] [of] another of which are dangerouperformed by a person who knows that his or her conduct endangers the life of another and who acts with conscious 9 3 using caljic nos. 5.17, 8.42, 8.43, 8.50 and 4.33, the jury was instructed on the two circumstances that negate malice aforethought (and that thereby differentiate murder from voluntary manslaughter)namely, (1) killing a sonable belief in the necessity to defend against imminent peril to life or great bodily defendant nevertheless argues that these instructions effectively foreclosed the jury from finding him guilty of any type of voluntary manslaughter. specifically, he argues that the manslaughter instruction, which meant that once the jurors concluded that he acted with implied malice, they could never find him guilty of voluntary manslaughter. this danger, defendant continues, was exacerbated by the caljic 8.75 instruction that required the jury to reach a verdict about murder before reaching a verdict upon voluntary manslaughter and by wish to vex, annoy, or injure another person, or an intent to do a and hence impermissiblereading of the jury instructions. he is correct that the murder and voluntary manslaughter instructions given 3 under this definition, an unintentional killing can be voluntary manslaughter if it is preceded by an intentional act that is, and is known to be, dangerous to human life. 10 and (ii) other instructions informed the jury that malice aforethought (based on either express or implied malice) does not exist if the defendant acts under a heat of passion or in imperfect self-defense. to be sure, the caljic instructions do in two steps (defining murder and voluntary manslaughter with parallel language, and then having separate instructions as to when murder is reduced to voluntary manslaughter) what the calcrim instructions do in just one step (defining voluntary manslaughter by the circumstances of reduction themselves). this is undoubtedly why calcrim is preferred over caljic. (cal. rules of court, rule 2.1050(e); people v. cornejo (2016) 3 cal.app.5th 36, 60.) but, read as a whole, even these caljic instructions correctly relay the pertinent legal principles and voluntary manslaughter. (accord, people v. covarrubias (2016) 1 persons and capable of understanding and correlating all jury instructions is the definition of malice in caljic 1.22. as the that is inapplicable to the crime of murder. however, this error people v. shade (1986) 185 cal.app.3d 711, 715.) ii. sentencing issues a. remand for firearm enhancement in january 2018, our legislature for the first time granted trial courts the discretion to dismiss firearm enhancements 11 pursuant to section 12022.53. ( 12022.53, subd. (h).) this legislation applies retroactively to persons, like defendant, whose convictions are not yet final. (e.g., people v. chavez (2018) 22 cal.app.5th 663, 712 (chavez).) because the trial court sentenced defendant several months after the amendments to al rule is that a trial court is presumed to have been aware of and followed people v. mosley (1997) 53 cal.app.4th 489, conferred discretion and why it elected not to exercise it is, by that silence is accompanied by indications in the record that the court misunderstood its discretion, silence cannot be equated with the proper exercise of discretion. (people v. carmony (2004) people v. davis (1996) 50 demonstrate[s] error on the amendment to section 12022.53, but the prosecutor argued court for the gang and the gun the prosecutor that he was wrong in arguing that the court had the discretion to sentence on both the gang and gun allegation because the court could impose only one of the two. however, and as the people argue on appealunderstanding was itself wrong because defendant personally used the firearm. (people v. brookfield (2009) 47 cal.4th 583, 590.) this confusion regarding the existence and scope of the --vis both enhancements undermines 12 12022.53 enhancement reflected a proper exercise of its same (chavez, at p. 713; people v. mcdaniels (2018) 22 cal.app.5th 420, 425), defendant is entitled to a remand. b. fines and restitution defendant argues that people v. duenas (2019) 30 cal.app.5th 1157 (duenas) requires us to vacate all of his restitution, fines and fees. he is wrong. 1. direct restitution duenas imposition of $19,563.70 in direct restitutionthat is, $12,563.70 to the mationg family and $7,000 to the victim compensation duenass id. at p. 1169.) what is more, defendant waived any objection to this amount because he had a statutory right to contest the amount of restitution ( 1202.4, subd. (f)(1)) and, rather than exercising that seem[] people v. case (2018) 5 cal.5th 1, 53 [so holding].) 2. restitution fines and fees citing the constitutional guarantees of due process and excessive fines, duenas held that trial courts may not impose three of the standard criminal assessments and finesnamely, the $40 court operations assessment ( 1465.8), the $30 criminal 13 convictions assessment (gov. code,  70373), and the $300 minimum restitution fine ( 1202.4)without first ascertaining duenas, supra, 30 cal.app.5th at pp. 1164, 1172, fn. 10.) so duenas applies to the $370 in fines and fees imposed in this case. however, we need not grapple with duenass validity because the record in this case, unlike the record in duenas itself, indicates that defendant has the ability to pay the $370 in assessments in this case. (cf. people v. bennett (1981) 128 cal.app.3d 354, 359-360 [remand for resentencing unnecessary where (people v. hennessey (1995) 37 cal.app.4th 1830, 1837; people v. gentry (1994) 28 cal.app.4th 1374, 1376-1377.) prisoners earn wages of at least $12 per month). (dept. of corrections, operations manual,  51120.6, 51121.10 (2019).) at even this minimum rate, defendant will have enough to pay the $370 in assessments and fines in 31 months, which is long before his 40 year sentence would end (or, if the trial court elects to strike the 25-year firearm enhancement or to impose a lesser firearm enhancement, before his lesser sentence would end). even if defendant does not voluntarily use his wages to pay the amounts due, the state may garnish between 20 and 50 percent of those wages to pay the restitution fine. ( 2085.5, subds. (a) & (c); people v. ellis (2019) 31 cal.app.5th 1090, 1093.) in light of these statutes, we reject dthe record also contains evidence that defendant, at the time of his crime, was employed. because defendant 14 (people v. gamache (2010) 48 cal.4th 347, 409), and hence no evidence that he would suffer any consequence for non-payment, a remand would serve no purpose. defendant asserts for the first time in his reply brief, and without citation to authority, that the presumption that a defendant sentenced to assertion is correct because, for the reasons described above, any presumption has been rebutted as to the minimum fines and fees imposed in this case. 15 disposition the matter is remanded for the limited purpose of allowing the trial court to exercise its sentencing discretion under section 12022.53, subdivision (h) (2019). in all other respects, the judgment of conviction is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. ______________________, j. hoffstadt we concur: _________________________, p. j. lui _________________________, j. chavez
