(b)-(i), 1170.12) and penal code section 667, subdivision (a)(1). after granting defendants motion to dismiss his prior strike conviction pursuant to penal code section 1385 and people v. superior court (romero) (1996) 13 cal.4th 497, 530, the trial court sentenced him to an aggregate state prison term of seven years, consisting of the lower term of two years for second degree burglary, plus five years for the penal code section 667, subdivision (a)(1), enhancement. defendant received presentence custody credits of 166 days (144 actual days and 22 days of conduct credits). 3 the trial court ordered defendant to pay a $40 security assessment, a $30 criminal conviction assessment and a $240 restitution fine. the court imposed and suspended a parole revocation fine pursuant to penal code section 1202.45. discussion we appointed counsel to represent defendant on appeal. after examination of the record, counsel filed an opening brief in which no issues were raised. (people v. wende (1979) 25 cal.3d 436, 441.) on october 15, 2012, we advised defendant he had 30 days within which to personally submit any contentions or issues he wished us to consider. on november 5, 2012, we received a hand-written and typed supplemental brief in which he makes numerous assertions (specifically concerning questions his trial counsel failed to ask, or evidence his trial counsel failed to introduce), which amount to a claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel. we have examined the entire record and are satisfied that defendants attorney has fully complied with the responsibilities of counsel and no arguable issues exist. (smith v. robbins (2000) 528 u.s. 259, 277-284 [120 s.ct. 746, 145 l.ed.2d 756]; people v. kelly (2006) 40 cal.4th 106, 118-119; people v. wende, supra, 25 cal.3d at p. 441.) the record provides no support for defendants claim that his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance.
