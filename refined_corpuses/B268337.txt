(a)(1), now  29800, subd. (a)(1)). he admitted prior convictions for residential burglary ( 459) and criminal threats ( 422), which qualified as serious or violent felonies under the three strikes law. (see  1170.12, subds. (a)-(d); 667, subds. (b)-(i).) consequently, the trial court sentenced him to an indeterminate term of 25 years to life imprisonment. we affirmed the judgment on direct appeal. (desantiago, supra, b212783, at p. 9.) in november 2012, voters adopted the act, which prospectively limited the imposition of indeterminate life sentences under the three strikes law by amending sections 667 and 1170.12. prior to the act, a defendant with two or more prior convictions for serious or violent felonies (see  667.5, 1192.7) who also was convicted of any new felony was subject to an indeterminate life sentence. (people v. yearwood (2013) 213 cal.app.4th 161, 167.) the acsentence for cases where the current crime is a serious or violent felony or the prosecution has pled and proved an enumerated ibid.) the act also established a 4 postconviction relief process soner who is serving an indeterminate life sentence imposed pursuant to the three strikes law for a crime that is not a serious or violent felony and who is not disqualified, may have his or her sentence recalled and be sentenced as a second strike offender unless the court determines that resentencing would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. ( (id. at p. 168.) in january 2013, desantiago filed a petition requesting recall of his sentence pursuant to section 1170.126. in september 2015, the trial court denied the petition on the ground that desantiago was ineligible for resentencing under the disqualifying provisions of the act because he was armed with a firearm [d]uring the commission of the . . . offense of being a felon in possession of a firearm. ( 667, subd. (e)(2)(c)(iii), 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(c)(iii), both cross-referenced in  1170.126, subd. (e).) the court relied on several recent decisions in concluding that the armed-with-a-firearm exclusion applies to current convictions for being a felon in possession of a firearm. (see people v. white (2014) 223 cal.app.4th 512 (white); people v. osuna (2014) 225 cal.app.4th 1020 (osuna); people v. elder (2014) 227 cal.app.4th 1308 (elder).) this timely appeal followed. discussion on appeal, desantiago argues the trial erred in finding him ineligible for resentencing under proposition 36. at issue is the proper interpretation of the exclusion precluding resentencing if urrent offense, the defendant . . . was armed with a firearm . . . . ( 667, subd. (e)(2)(c)(iii), 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(c)(iii).) we review de novo 5 issues of statutory interpretation. (people v. bradford (2014) 227 cal.app.4th 1322, 1332.) when interpreting a voter initiative, we apply the same principles that govern statutory construction. we turn first to the language of the statute, giving the words their ordinary the statutory language must also be construed in the context of the statute as a whole and the overall statutory scheme. [citation.] when the language is ambiguous, we refer to other indicia of the intent, particularly the analyses and arguments contained i(people v. rizo (2000) 22 cal.4th 681, 685.) appellant offense as an addition and not just be an element of the current other words, he maintains that one cannot be during the commission of the current offense if the current offense is simple possession of a firearm. he acknowledges that appellate courts consistently have rejected this argument and held that the armed-with-a-firearm exclusion applies to the offense of being a felon in possession of a firearm. (see osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at pp. 1029-1032; white, supra, 223 cal.app.4th at pp. 524-527; people v. blakely (2014) 225 cal.app.4th 1042, 1051-1057 (blakely); elder, supra, 227 cal.app.4th at pp. 1312-1314; people v. brimmer (2014) 230 cal.app.4th 782, 793-799 (brimmer); people v. hicks (2014) 231 cal.app.4th 275, 283-284 (hicks); people v. white (2016) 243 cal.app.4th 1354, 1362-1363 (white).) he argues these cases were wrongly decided. we disagree with his analysis for the reasons explained below. 6 i judicially construed to mean having a firearm available for use, either offensively or defensively. (osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1029, citing  1203.06, subd. (b)(3); health & saf. code,  11370.1, subd. (a); people v. bland (1995) 10 cal.4th 991, 997 (bland) [construing arming enhancement in  12022].) we presume the elecarmed with a firearmhave this meaning under proposition 36. (osuna, at p. 1029, citing people v. weidert (1985) 39 cal.3d 836, 844 [the enacting body is deemed to be aware of existing laws and judicial constructions in effect at the time legislation is enacted . . . [and] [t]his principle applies to legislation enacted by initiative.) following this construction, courts uniformly have held that the armed-with-a-firearm exclusion applies to a conviction for being a felon in possession of a firearm whenever the record indicates the defendant was in actual physical possession of the weapon.2 (see, e.g., osuna, at p. 1030 [record showed fleeing defendant was observed holding handgun that was discovered during subsequent search of nearby house from which he emerged]; white, supra, 223 cal.app.4th at p. 524 [record showed defendant was observed tossing away pair of rolled-up sweatpants 2 because section 1170.126 does not require facts related to resolved by the verdicts or special findings rendered at trial, the trial court may independently examine the record of conviction to make determinations regarding those facts. (see white, supra, 223 cal.app.4th at pp. 526-527; osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1020; elder, supra, 227 cal.app.4th at pp. 1314-1316; brimmer, supra, 230 cal.app.4th at pp. 799-801; hicks, supra, 231 cal.app.4th at p. 286.) 7 containing handgun during police pursuit]; brimmer, supra, 230 cal.app.4th at p. 796 [record showed defendant was personally armed with unloaded shotgun while arguing with his girlfriend].) the facts of this case are not distinguishable. the record shows appellant was observed tossing a dark object as he was running from a police officer. (desantiago, supra, b212783, at p. 1.) the officer discovered an unloaded handgun shortly thereafter in the location where he had seen appellant toss the object. (ibid.) subsequent discovery, the evidence also indicated that appellant had actually used the handgun because the weapon was operable and he had gunpowder residue on his hands. (ibid.) based on this record, it is clear that available for use, either offensively or defensively and w section 667, subdivision (e)(2)(c)(iii) and section 1170.12, subdivision (c)(2)(c)(iii). (see osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at pp. 1029-1032.) appellant does not dispute that the record shows he had a firearm available for use, either offensively or defensively. (osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1029.) rather, he maintains osuna incorrectly interpreted the armed-with-a-firearm exclusion. he argues the exclusion attach to the current offense as an addition and not just be an relying on bland, supra, 10 cal.4th at page 997, he maintains the exclusion should be interpreted to disqualify an inmate from resentencing only if the arming is or has some current offense other than, or in addition to, the offense of possessing a firearm as a felon. we disagree. 8 as a preliminary matter, appellant incorrectly asserts that being armed with a firearm is an element of the offense of being a felon in possession of a firearm. (see blakely, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1052 [the elements of the offense are owing possession, custody, or control of a firearm . . . . [] a firearm can be under a white, suprat of being armed with a firearm . . . necessarily requires possession of the firearm, possession of a firearm does not necessarily require that ) thus, there are circumstances under which a third strike offender is eligible for resentencing even though he or she was commission of the felon-in-possession offense. (see blakely, at p. 1052; osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1030; elder, supra, 227 cal.app.4th at pp. 1313-1314.) this undermines assumption that the arming must attach to a separate offense and not just be an element of the current offense. courts consistently have rejected the argument that the arming must have facilitative nexuswith a separate offense. (see osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1032; accord brimmer, supra, 230 cal.app.4th at pp. 798-799; hicks, supra, 231 cal.app.4th at pp. 283-284; white, supra, 243 cal.app.4th at pp. 1362-1363.) as appellant notes, the osuna court ed with a bland, supra, 10 cal.4th at page 997. that case involved a sentencing enhancement that applies where a a felony drug possession offense. ( 12022, subd. (c).) as discussed in osuna, at p. 1030, the bland court interpreted the phrase 9 defendant has the specified weapon available for use, either bland, at p. 997.) the court went on to drugs and a firearm will satisfy the statutory requirement of possession only if the evidence shows a nexus or link between the firearm (id. at p. 1002.) based on this . . . it must be construed to require that the weapon be available for use in furtherance of the commission of the offense the osuna court rejected this argument, explaining that the construction of section 12022 requiring a facilitative nexus between the arming and an underlying felony is specific to the enhancementan additional term of imprisonment added to the base term, for which a defendant cannot be punished until and unless convicted of a related (osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1030.) as the court explained not further or aid in the commission of the crime of possession of a firearm by a felon [former  12021, subd. (a)(1), now  29800, subd. (a)(1)]. thus, a defendant convicted of violating . . . section 12021 does not, regardless of the facts of the offense, risk imposition of additional punishment pursuant to section 12022, because tbetween the arming and id. at p. 1032.) the court also reasoned that unlike section 12022, which requires that a defendant be armed in 10 imposed (italics added), [proposition 36] disqualifies an inmate from eligibility for lesser punishment if he or she was armed with during added). ut the s 3d new internat. dict. (1986) p. 703.) in other words, it requires a temporal nexus between the arming and the underlying felony, not a facilitative one. the two are not the (osuna, at p. 1032.) defendant argues the osuna analysis does not withstand scrutiny because there is no meaningful distinction between the use of the words to support the conclusion that the armed-with-a-firearm exclusion only requires a temporal nexus between the arming and the possession offense. although we agree that the two words often are used synonymously, courts applying the section 12022 sentencing enhancement have articulated a distinction. (see in re pritchett (1994) 26 cal.app.4th 1754, 1757 [rejecting an enhancement ed the shotgun as a club during his crime of possession. . . . [u]sing it as a club in no way further, we disagree with the contention that by borrowing a judicial construction of from blandcomprehensive interpretation of a sentencing enhancement statute. here, our task is to determine the proper scope of an eligibility exclusion under proposition 36. the issue is not whether a defendant could or should be punished more harshly for a particular aspect of his or her offense, but whether, having already been found to warrant an indeterminate life sentence as 11 a third strike offender, he or she should now be eligible for a lesser term. (blakely, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1054.) ii appellant also argues the plain language and structure of s support his proposed interpretation of the exclusion. section 1170.126, subdivision (e)(2) provides that an inmate is ineligible for relief if his or her sentence was imposed for any offense listed in clauses (i) to (iii) of section 667, subdivision (e)(2)(c) and section 1170.12, subdivision (c)(2)(c). both clauses (i) and (ii) enumerate and cross-reference specific controlled substance and sex offenses using the language . . . ., 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(c).) clause (iii), the exclusion at issue here, does not enumerate specific offenses but states in full: during the commission of the current offense, the defendant used a firearm, was armed with a firearm or deadly weapon, or intended to cause great bodily injury to another person.( 667, subd. (e)(2)(c)(iii), 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(c)(iii).) based on this distinction, appellant reasons that if the statute were intended to exclude the offense of felon in possession of a firearm, this offense would have been specifically enumerated. (see gikas v. zolin (1993) 6 cal.4th 841, 852 [the expression of some things in a statute necessarily means the exclusion of other things not expressed].) instead, he maintainsother offense to which the arming is tethered. we interpret this linguistic and structural distinction between the exclusions differently. clause (iii) effectively functions as a catch-all provision to exclude violent or dangerous 12 third strike offenders from resentencing eligibility. (see  667, subd. (e)(2)(c)(iii), 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(c)(iii).) as the blakely [a]pparently recognizing the maxim expressio unius est exclusio alterius . . . voters rendered ineligible for resentencing not only narrowly drawn categories of third strike offenders who committed particular, specified offenses or types of offenses, but also broadly inclusive categories of offenders who, during commission of their crimesand regardless of those crimes basic statutory elementsused a firearm, were armed with a firearm or deadly weapon, or intended to cause great b(blakely, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1055.) support for this interpretation is found in the ballot materials related to proposition 36. sentence penalty if third strike conviction was for certain nonserious, non-violent sex or drug offenses or involved firearm possession. (voter information guide, gen. elec. (nov. 6, 2012) official title and summary, p. 48, italics added.) proponents stated: child molesters, and other dangerous criminals serve their full sentences. [] . . . [] today, dangerous criminals are being released early from prison because jails are overcrowded with nonviolent offenders who pose no risk to the public. prop. 36 prevents dangerous criminals from being released early. people convicted of shoplifting a pair of socks, stealing bread or baby t deserve life sentences. (voter information guide, gen. elec., supra, rebuttal to argument against prop. 36, p. 53, italics added & omitted.) section 1 of the initiative measure provides [m]aintain that repeat offenders convicted 13 of non-violent, non-serious crimes like shoplifting and simple drug possession will receive twice the normal sentence instead of a life sentence. (voter information guide, gen. elec., supra, text of proposed laws,  1, p. 105, italics added.) materials expressly distinguished between dangerous criminals who were deserving of life sentences, and petty criminals (such as shoplifters and those convicted of simple drug possession) who posed little or no risk to the public and did not deserve life sentences (blakely, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at pp. 1056-1057.) was not to throw open the prison doors to all third strike offenders whose current convictions were not for serious or violent felonies, but only to those who were perceived as nondangerous or posing little or no risk to the public.id. at p. 1057, italics omitted.) having a weapon readily available for use generally does not make a person truly dangerous, we believe the record shows he is the kind of third strike offender that proposition 36 seeks to exclude from resentencing. a felon who has been convicted of two or more serious and/or violent felonies in the past, and most recently had a firearm readily available for use, simply does not pose little or no risk to the public.ibid.) 14 disposition the order denying the petition for recall and resentencing is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. epstein, p. j. we concur: willhite, j. collins, j.
