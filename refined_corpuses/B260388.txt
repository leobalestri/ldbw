(see cal. law revision com. & historical and statutory notes, 51d, 3 (d)), and two prior serious felonies ( 667, subd. (a)(1)). the people also alleged that a principal in the robbery was armed with a firearm ( 12022, subd. (a)(1)). a jury convicted defendant of all three offenses and found the conduct enhancement to be true. the trial court found the prior conviction allegations to be true. the trial court sentenced defendant to prison for 86 years to life. the trial court imposed consecutive sentences of 25 years to life on each offense because they were each -subd. (e)(2); 1170.12, subd. (c)(2).) the trial court then imposed a consecutive sentence of one year for the firearm enhancement and five years for each prior serious felony conviction. defendant appealed. we affirmed defendto the trial court to exercise its discretion whether to impose consecutive or concurrent sentences on the firearm and controlled substance possession counts. (people v. turner (october 16, 1998, b112835 [nonpub. opn.], at pp. 3-5.) the trial court reimposed consecutive sentences. ii. the current petition in 2012, the voters enacted the act. among other things, the act permits criminal -law to seek -conduct is not otherwise excepted from eligibility. ( 1170.126, subds. (a) & (e)(1).) in 2014, defendant sought resentencing on the firearm possession and controlled substance possession counts. the trial court denied his petition, reasoning that degree robbery count automatically rendered him ineligible for resentencing on the other two counts. defendant timely appeals. discussion defendant argues that the trial court erred in declaring defendant ineligible for 4 sentences just because he was ineligible on the second degree robbery count. defendant is correct. in a decision handed down after eligibility for resentencing to be evaluated on a count-by-johnson, supra, (2015) 61cal.4th at p. 688), such that ineligibility for resentencing on one count does not people v. chism (2014) 58 cal.4th 1266, 1295, fn. 12.) here, the for rese-eligibility for resentencing under the act de novo. (people v. martinez (2014) 226 cal.app.4th 1169, 1181.) defendant is ineligible for resentencing under the act on the robbery count -defined as serious and/or violent felonies by subdivision (c) of section 667.5 or both a serious felony ( 1192.7, subd. (c)(19)) and a violent felony ( 667.5, subd. (c)(9)), so the act by its terms does not reach this count. additionally, defendant is ineligible for resentencing under the act on the felon in possession of a firearm count. although that offense is neither a serious nor violent section 667, subdivisions (e)(2)(c)(i)-(iii). ( 1170.126, subd. (e)(2).) section 667, subdivision (esubd. for use, either offenspeople v. bland (1995) 10 cal.4th 991, 997;  1203.06, subd.

(see white, supra, 223 cal.app.4th at p. 527 [so holding, as to felon in possession of a firearm count where defendant was also armed]; people v. osuna (2014) 225 cal.app.4th 1020, 1026-1027 [same]; elder, at pp. 1313-1314 [same]; brimmer, at pp. 793-797 [same].) for the same reasons, defendant is also ineligible for resentencing on the controlled substance possession count. defendant possessed the cocaine at the same time he possessed the gun. because he was, as explained above, armed while possessing the gun, he was no less armed while simultaneously possessing the cocaine. where a defendant is armed while possessing a controlled substance, he is ineligible for resentencing on that count. (see people v. quinones (2014) 228 cal.app.4th 1040, 1042-1045.) disposition the order denying the petition for resentencing is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. _______________________, j. hoffstadt we concur: ____________________________, p.j. _______________________, j. boren chavez
