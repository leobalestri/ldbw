(a); count 1),1 possession of a firearm by a felon ( 29800, subd. (a)(1); count 2), and unlawful possession of ammunition ( 30305, subd. (a)(1); count 3). it was alleged that he had served a prior prison term within the meaning of section 667.5, subdivision (b). the jury convicted appellant on counts 1 and 3. count 2 was dismissed after the trial court declared a mistrial because the jury was unable to reach a verdict. the trial court sentenced appellant to serve nine years eight months in state prison. the sentence included a one-year prior prison term enhancement. appellant appeals, arguing: (1) the trial court erred by failing to conduct an in camera review in connection with his pitchess2 motion; and (2) the trial court committed error by failing to conduct a trial regarding the truth of the prior prison term allegation. we find no pitchess error and affirm the judgment as it relates to the convictions. we conditionally reverse the judgment as it relates to the enhancement because appellant was denied a trial on the prior prison term allegation. upon remand, the trial court shall conduct a trial and determine whether the allegation is true. if it finds the allegation true, it shall reinstate the 1 all further statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise indicated. 2 in pitchess v. superior court (1974) 11 cal.3d 531 (pitchess), our supreme court created a procedure for a in 1978, the legislature codified pitchess in sections 832.7 and 832.8, and evidence code sections 1043 through 1045. (people v. jordan (2003) 108 cal.app.4th 349, 359.) 3 judgment. if it finds the allegation not true, it shall strike the enhancement from the sentence. facts the crimes; the arrest; the police report a patrol car began following d.h. while he was driving his chrysler sebring in the desert near lancaster. appellant, who was in the passenger seat, saw the patrol car and panicked. he pointed a gun at d.h. this prompted d.h. to pull over to the side of the road. appellant opened the door and started to get out. but then he got back in and told d.h. to keep driving. because d.h. was afraid, he complied. soon after, d.h. ended the situation by driving into a river bed and saying he could not go any farther. detective sean maloney and deputy adam nelson of the los angeles county department pulled over, exited their patrol car and approached the chrysler, which was stuck in some sand. d.h. jumped out, approached them while holding his hands in the air, and said, he has a gun. help meanwhile, appellant decamped with a gun in his hand. deputy nelson gave chase but appellant evaded capture for a while. eventually, deputy nelson observed appellant running down a road and detained him. when deputy nelson returned to the chrysler, he conducted a search and retrieved a black backpack. it contained two unloaded magazines for weapons. detective maloney, deputy nelson, and a third officer with a gun dog later searched the area for a gun but did not find one. after appellant was arrested, he admitted the magazines in the backpack belonged to him. 4 the police report was prepared by deputy nelson. it set forth details of the encounter with d.h. and appellant, including that deputy nelson saw a gun and detective maloney at one also, it provided a synopsis of , noting: fir[appellant] said he fled law enforcement on foot because [d.h.] told him to do so. the pitchess motion prior to trial, appellant filed a pitchess motion to discover complaints against detective maloney and deputy nelson on topics such as fabrication of charges and evidence. defense counsel submitted a declaration stating: the police report indicated that both detective maloney and deputy nelson saw appellant holding a gun. appellant, in contrast, denied that he ever had a gun in his hands, either inside or outside the chrysler. he specific factual scenario of officer misconduct that is plausible when read in light of trial; posttrial matters the jury found appellant guilty on counts 1 and 3. defense counsel requested a bench trial on the prior. without holding a bench trial on the prior, the trial court proceeded to sentence appellant. 5 discussion i. pitchess discovery. to discover complaints against a peace officer, a moving party must establish good cause for compelling production. (evid. code,  1043, subds. (a)-(b).) a . . . to establish not only a logical link between the defense proposed and the pending charge, but also to articulate how the discovery being sought would support such a defense or how it would warrick v. superior court (2005) 35 cal.4th 1011, 1021.) in addition, a defendant is required to articulate a plausible scenario of officer misconduct. (id. at p. 1026). the scenario must be one that might or could have occurred. such a scenario is plausible because it presents an assertion of specific police misconduct that is both internally (ibid.) if good cause is established, a trial court must examine the requested information in camera and determine whether the defendant is entitled to receive it in order to ensure a fair trial. (city of santa cruz v. municipal court (1989) 49 cal.3d 74, 8285.) we will defer to a trial court and uphold its ruling on a pitchess motion unless the record establishes that it abused its discretion. (city of san jose v. superior court (1998) 67 cal.app.4th 1135, 1145.) an erroneous denial of a pitchess motion is subject to harmless error analysis. (people v. memro (1985) 38 cal.3d 658, 684.) appellant did not allege any misconduct by detective maloney and deputy nelson. at most, appellant implied that they falsely stated that he possessed a gun when in fact he only 6 possessed a bong. we need not decide whether this was sufficient to show good cause because even if there was error, appellant failed to demonstrate prejudice. the jury hung on the gun charge and it was dismissed. appellant has not explained why the evidence sought would support a defense on count 1 or count 3, or why impeachment of the officers would be relevant as to the outcome of those counts. regarding count 1, it was supported by impeachment of the officers. as to count 3, appellant has not denied culpability either below or on appeal, and there was no implication in his pitchess motion that the count was the product of police misconduct. ii. the prior. a defendant has a right to a trial on the factual issues raised by a denial of a prior prison term allegation. (cf. people v. cross (2015) 61 cal.4th 164, 172;  1025.) appellant was denied this right, which the people concede. the one-year enhancement for a prior prison term must be reversed and the matter must be remanded for a trial on the matter. 7 disposition the judgment is affirmed as to the convictions. the judgment is conditionally reversed as to the prior prison term enhancement and remanded for a trial. if the trial finds the prior prison term allegation true, it shall reinstate that portion of the judgment. if it finds the allegation not true, it shall strike the enhancement. not to be published in the official reports. _____________________, j. ashmann-gerst we concur: ________________________, p. j. lui _______________________, j. chavez
