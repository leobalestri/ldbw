(people v. washington (aug. 23, 2016, b257234 [nonpub. opn.] (washington i).) we remanded the case to the trial court with directions, among other things, to exercise its discretion to impose or strike a one-year prior prison term enhancement under section 667.5, subdivision (b). (washington i, supra, at p. 11.) on september 28, 2016 washington filed a petition for review in the supreme court. on november 22, 2016 the supreme court denied the petition for review. discussion on june 17, 2015, when the trial court ruled on (people v. scarbrough (2015) 240 cal.app.4th 916, 924-925, 929 (scarbrough); see people v. bradshaw (2016) 246 cal.app.4th 1251, 1257 to the statutory remedy, set forth in section 1170.18, of petitioning for recall of sentence [citation] or applying for designation of felony convictions as misdemeanors [citation], as appropriate, in the trial court once the judgment is final; accord, people v. noyan (2014) 232 cal.app.4th 657, 672.) as the court explained in scarbrough, the general rule is that the trial court may not issue an order affecting a judgment while an appeal is pending. this rule protects the jurisdiction of (scarbrough, at 4 p. 923.) the court in scarbrough concluded that nothing in proposition 47 creates an exception to this general rule or suggests the voters intended that the defendant must immediately seek, or the trial court must immediately grant, relief under proposition 47. (ibid.) the court explained that, to the contrary, proposition 47 gives a defendant three years from the effective date of the initiative, or longer on a showing of good cause, to petition for relief. (id. at p. 928; see  1170.18, subd. (j).) the court in scarbrough noted that allowing a trial court to hear a petition under proposition 47 while an appeal was pending also would not result in any judicial economy savings: oncurrent jurisdiction would not support judicial economy. our efforts to review the initial judgment may be rendered futile; we may be asked to review conflicting judgments, each with different errors to be corrected; and the trial court may be asked to effectuate a remittitur against a judgment that has since been modified. these scenarios would lead to chaos, confusion, and wastenot judicial economy. additionally, there is nothing that indicates judicial economy was even contemplated by the voters(scarbrough at p. 928.) because the trial court did not have jurisdiction to consider petition for resentencing under proposition 47 during the pendency of his appeal, order denying the petition in part did not affect substantial rights and is not appealable. therefore, this appeal must be dismissed. (see  1237, subd. (b); people v. behrmann (1949) 34 cal.2d 459, 462; people v. turrin (2009) 176 cal.app.4th 1200, 1208; people v. chlad (1992) 6 cal.app.4th 1719, 1726; see also people v. loper (2015) 60 cal.4th 1155, 1166 refusal to act on a defective defense motion for resentencing could not have affected 5 any legal rights the defendants . . . possessed, and the appellate courts properly dismissed the appeals.) dismissal of this appeal will provide washington with an opportunity to obtain some of the relief he seeks in this appeal. the court and counsel expressed some uncertainty about the evidence relating to the count the court concluded was not eligible for resentencing under proposition 47, including questions about which stolen items related to that specific count and their monetary values.2 neither the court nor [the] prosecutor could accurately recall what evidence had been presented at the hearing to support the that count, and that the court and the prosecutor confused the evidence relating to that count with the evidence relating to another count. filing a new petition, when the trial court has jurisdiction, will give 2 as we stated in washington ithe people charged washington with 21 counts arising from incidents occurring on six separate dates. in each of the first five incidents, washington entered a 24 hour fitness gym, stole credit cards and other personal effects from lockers, then used the stolen credit cards to make purchases at various retailers. the sixth incident involved s motel room, in which police discovered cocaine and stolen property.washington i, supra, at p. 1.) the confusion at the august 31, 2015 hearing involved which items of personal property were involved in the count that the court did not reclassify as a misdemeanor, whether the value of those items did not exceed $950, and whether those items were the subject of a different count. in fact, the court had continued the sentencing hearing to allow newly substituted-in counsel stolen items involved in this count. 6 washington, the people, and the trial court an opportunity to review the evidence and sort out which evidence related to which count. people v. contreras (2015) 237 cal.app.4th 868, cited by washington, is distinguishable. the defendant in that case asked the court of appeal to reduce two felony convictions to misdemeanors under proposition 47 and remand the case to the trial court for resentencing. (id. at p. 891.) the court of appeal declined to because doing so would at must be id. at p. 892.) the court concludedin essence, defendant asks this court to designate his offenses as misdemeanors under section 1170.18 in the first instance, rather than review the trial cos ruling on his petitions to recall his sentence. that is not our role.id. at pp. 891-892; see people v. awad (2015) 238 cal.app.4th 215, 221-222 [ . . . vests with the trial .) washington is not asking this court to grant him relief under proposition 47 in the first instance. he is asking this court for appellate review of an order the trial court had no jurisdiction to make.3 3 in people v. awad, supra, 238 cal.app.4th 215 the court postconviction motion (id. at p. 222.) washington does not ask for that remedy here. in any event, awad is distinguishable. in awad the trial court because the trial court ruled it lacked jurisdiction to hear the petition while the case was on appeal.
