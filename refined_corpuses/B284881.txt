filed 8/14/18 p. v. sanchez ca2/2 not to be published in the official reports california rules of court, rule 8.1115(a), prohibits courts and parties from citing or relying on opinions not certified for publication or ordered published, except as specified by rule 8.1115(b). this opinion has not been certified for publication or ordered published for purposes of rule 8.1115. in the court of appeal of the state of california second appellate district division two the people, plaintiff and respondent, v. jose dejesus sanchez, defendant and appellant. b284881 (los angeles county super. ct. no. ba441318) the court: on september 7, 2016, the los angeles county district appellant jose dejesus sanchez with one count of murder. (pen. code,  187, subd. (a).) it was also alleged that defendant personally used a deadly and dangerous weapon, a knife, in the commission of the crime. (pen. code,  12022, subd. (b)(1).) defendant pleaded not guilty and denied all allegations. on july 13, 2017, the jury returned a verdict of first degree murder, finding the knife enhancement true. 2 defendant was sentenced to serve 25 years to life, plus a consecutive sentence of one year for the knife enhancement, for a total of 26 years to life in prison. this timely appeal ensued. counsel was appointed to represent defendant in connection with this appeal. after examination of the record, o arguable issues were raised. on march 27, 2018, we advised defendant that he had 30 days within which to personally submit any contentions or issues for us to consider. after receiving an extension, on july 23, 2018, defendant submitted a supplemental brief. we address each argument he raises in turn. 1. challenges to the verdict form first, defendant appears to argue that the appellate record is inadequate because it does not contain any evidence that the jury was provided with proper verdict forms. no proof that verdict forms for second degree murder or in support, he cites to various case law and the california rules of court, which require that an appellant supply the appellate court with an adequate record and adequate record citations. what defendant does not seem to grasp is that he, as the appellant, has the burden of providing us with an adequate record for appellate review. (hernandez v. california hospital medical center (2000) 78 cal.app.4th 498, 502.) because defendant did not provide us with an adequate record, and we presume the judgment was correct (ibid.), defendant offers no basis for reversal. setting that procedural obstacle aside, to the extent defendant is claiming that the jury was only provided with the 3 one guilty verdict form for first degree murder, the appellate record indicates otherwise. as evidenced by the transcript of the were signed by both counsel and provided to the jury. moreover, the trial court gave the jury verdict forms: for use when defendant is charged with first degree murder and jury is given not guilty forms for each jurors on how to consider the different kinds of homicide (first degree murder, second degree murder, and voluntary manslaughter) charged and how to use the different verdict forms provided to them. not only does this instruction confirm that various verdict forms were provided to the jury, but we also presume the jury understood and followed these instructions. since the jury was properly instructed as to the different degrees of the offense charged, had only the one first degree murder verdict form been provided to them, we presume that the jury would have either asked for the proper verdict form or written it out themselves. (people v. osband (1996) 13 cal.4th 622, 689690.) seconddefendant offers no evidence of juror confusion, and his brief speculation is insufficient to reverse his judgment of conviction. (people v. williams (1988) 44 cal.3d 883, 933.) third, defendant argues that the predrafted jury verdict form directed a true finding on the penal code section 12022, subdivision (b)(1), allegation against him. but defendant offers no legal authority in support of his contention that the verdict 4 form violates the law. (benach v. county of los angeles (2007) 149 cal.app.4th 836, 852.) setting this issue aside, we see no prejudice in the form of the verdict. the jury was given the and the evidence was overwhelming that defendant used a knife when he murdered the victim.1 2. arrest defendant argues that the trial court erred when it failed to admit evidence that prosecution witness izaiah ramirez (ramirez) had been arrested on a crime of moral turpitude, namely violation of vehicle code section 31.2 vehicle code writing, information to a peace officer while in the performance of his duties under the provisions of this code when such person 1 defendant also argues that he was denied effective assistance of counsel in connection with the verdict form. that the jury was provided verdict forms allowing them to find degree murder, second degree given that we reach the issue on the merits, there is no reason for us to consider whether defendans trial counsel was ineffective. 2 defendant also argues that he was denied effective assistance of counsel regarding this issue. given that we reach the issue on the merits, there is no reason for us to consider s trial counsel was ineffective. 5 this statute because it would have been relevant in its assessment of his credibility. even if the trial court erred in not admitting this evidence, we conclude that the error was harmless as a matter of law. (people v. houston (2012) 54 cal.4th 1186, 1222; chapman v. california (1967) 386 u.s. 18, 24; people v. watson (1956) 46 cal.2d 818, 836.) at least one other witness testified that he saw defendant stab the victim in the neck. 3. alleged failure to advise defendant to accept a plea defendant argues that he was denied effective assistance of counsel when his trial attorney advised him to proceed to trial as opposed to accepting a plea deal to second degree murder. he also argues that his defense attorney failed to conduct an adequate investigation to prepare for trial and failed to impeach a witness. we usually do not consider ineffective assistance of counsel claims on appeal; we generally leave defendants to petition for a conduct might have had a tactical purpose and the appellate record does not illuminate its basis. (people v. phillips (1985) 41 cal.3d 29, 61.) we only address the claim on appeal if there could be no conceivable ctions. (people v. diaz (1992) 3 cal.4th 495, 558; people v. pope (1979) 23 cal.3d 412, 426.) because there may have been a legitimate tactical defendant, we cannot decide these issues on direct appeal. we have examined the entire record and we are satisfied that appellate counsel has fully complied with her 6 responsibilities and that no arguable issues exist. (people v. wende (1979) 25 cal.3d 436, 441 (wende).) defendant has, by virtwende procedure and our review of the record, received adequate and effective appellate review of the judgment and sentence entered against him in this case. (smith v. robbins (2000) 528 u.s. 259, 278; people v. kelly (2006) 40 cal.4th 106, 123124.) the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. ____________________________________________________________ lui, p. j., ashmann-gerst, j., chavez, j.
