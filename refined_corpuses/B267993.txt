(a)(1).) the trial court n aggregate term of seven years in state prison. islas argues insufficient evidence supports his robbery conviction because there was no evidence he used force or fear. we disagree and affirm. facts background michael angeles and alex vargas worked as loss prevention officers for superior grocers in long beach. on march 25, 2015, both men were on duty when islas and priscilla mcmichael entered the store. officer vargas watched islas select a three-pack of beer from the refrigeration aisle and then walk several aisles over to where mcmichael stood. officer angeles saw mcmichael place several items in her purse, including shampoo and lotion bottles. officers angeles and vargas then watched islas approach mcmichael to hand her the beer, and mcmichael placed the beer in her purse with the other items. islas and mcmichael exited the store without paying. officers angeles and vargas followed them outside. officers angeles and vargas approached mcmichael and islas in the parking lot. the two men identified themselves as loss prevention officers, displayed their badges, and asked mcmichael and islas to come back inside the store. mcmichael and islas attempted to walk away, but officer vargas positioned himself in front of mcmichael to prevent her from leaving. mcmichael then became hysterical and screamed at officer vargas. islas began walking down a nearby alleyway. officer angeles testified mcmichael began swinging her purse at officer vargas, yelling that he could have the merchandise back, and throwing the items from her purse in his direction. one of these items, a lotion bottle, hit vargas in the chest and exploded rse, islas returned to the scene. he grabbed 1 all further undesignated section references are to the penal code. 3 officer raised it above his right shoulder. officer angeles warned islas that the situation would escalate to a robbery if he hit him or officer vargas. islas then let go of officer arm, and both islas and mcmichael fled the scene. officer vargas testimony was similar, but varied slightly. vargas testified he king lot. both individuals -of-er the purse. mcmichael had a cross-body strap, so the tug-of-war took place while she was wearing it. islas then ran back, grabbed the air at vargas. vargas told islas that if he punched him or angeles, the situation would be considered a robbery. islas lowered his vargas as she and islas fled down an alleyway. officers angeles and vargas then called 911 and followed mcmichael and islas. mcmichael tripped and fell in the alleyway, but islas continued running and got on the metro train. officers angeles and vargas detained mcmichael. shortly thereafter, long beach police officer timothy redshaw arrived in the alleyway, handcuffed mcmichael, and searched her purse. he found a can of beer in her bag, but did not note this on his police report. angeles testified that he believed s purse were not all of the ones he saw mcmichael put into her purse in the store. the police sent out a radio dispatch informing officers that a robbery suspect was on board the metro train. officer edmund moscoso responded, located the train, and detained islas and two other individuals. angeles and vargas then identified islas as the robbery suspect in a field show up, and the police arrested islas. the trial the people filed an information charging islas with second degree robbery (count 1;  211.) the information also alleged that islas suffered a prior conviction that qualified as both a serious felony and a strike. ( 667, subds. (a), (b)-(j); 1170.12.) islas pleaded not guilty and denied the special allegations. a jury found islas guilty of second 4 degree robbery. islas then admitted the prior allegations. he received a sentence of seven years in state prison, comprised of the low term of two years and an additional five years for the prior serious felony allegation. the court struck the prior strike allegation for sentencing purposes pursuant to section 1385. the trial court ordered islas to pay a variety of fines and fees and awarded him 241 days of presentence custody credit. islas timely appealed discussion islas contends the evidence is insufficient to support the robbery conviction. specifically, he argues the evidence did not establish he used force or fear with the intent to we disagree. when an appellant challenges the sufficiency of evidence sverdict, the reviewing court examines whether there was substantial evidence, considered as a whole, to permit a reasonable trier of fact to find the defendant guilty of the charged crime beyond a reasonable doubt. (jackson v. virginia (1979) 443 u.s. 307, 318-319; see also people v. smith (2014) 60 cal.4th 603, 617; people v. lindberg (2008) 45 cal.4th 1, 27.) (people v. kraft (2000) 23 cal.4th 978, 1053.) o (people v. young (2005) 34 cal.4th 1149, 1181 (young), citing people v. allen (1985) 165 cal.app.3d 616, 623.) the reviewing court presumes every fact that the trier of fact could reasonably have deduced from the evidence in support of the judgment. (people v. hajek and vo (2014) 58 cal.4th 1144, 1197; see also people v. lewis (1990) 50 cal.3d 262, 277; people v. white (2014) 230 cal.app.4th 305, 315, fn. 13.) [t]he relevant question is whether, after viewing the evidence in light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. (people v. staten (2000) 24 cal.4th 434, 460.) therefore, the upon no 5 hypothesis whatever is there sufficient substantial evidence to support [the conviction]. (people v. hughes (2002) 27 cal.4th 287, 370.) the possession of another . . . ( 211.) the distinguishing factor that turns a larceny into a robbery is the application of force or fear to the victim to permanently deprive him of his property. (people v. gomez (2008) 43 cal.4th 249, 265; people v. marquez (2000) 78 cal.app.4th 1302, 1308.) any amount of force or fear beyond the seizure of the property that occurs concurrently with the larceny is sufficient to elevate the charge to robbery. (people v. morales (1975) 49 cal.app.3d 134, 139.) divides the taking of property into two elements gaining physical possession of the the application of fear or force in either stage of the crime is sufficient to transform larceny into robbery. (see people v. gomez, supra, 43 cal.4th at pp. 264-265.) therefore, even if the perpetrator acquires wrongful possession peacefully, mere theft will become robbery if he or she uses force or fear while moving the property. (miller v. superior court (2004) 115 cal.app.4th 216, 222; people v. cooper (1991) 53 cal.3d 1158, 1165, fn. 8.) additionally, a defendant can be found guilty of robbery if he uses force or fear either to acquire original possession of the property or resist attempts to retake the property. (people v. estes (1983) 147 cal.app.3d 23, 27-28 (estes); see also people v. anderson (1966) 64 cal.2d 633, 638-639.) islas concedes that he used force or fear against officers angeles and vargas during the incident, but claims that this force or fear should not elevate the charge from larceny to robbery. he contends officer shows that all of the items officer , and thus mcmichael surrendered the stolen merchandise before islas intervened. completed and ended the theft, and the subsequent use of force could not complete a omplished if no caption or 6 asportation is occurring then there is no ongoing theft to aggravate into robbery. we are not persuaded. islas correctly contends that if a defendant before using force, then, of course he could be guilty of theft, but not of an estes type (people v. pham (1993) 15 cal.app.4th 61, 68.) however, the prosecution presented evidence that all the stolen property had not been abandoned. officer vargas testified that he was certain that the throwing of the items from the purse occurred after the struggle for the purse. further, officer redshaw testified that he saw a can of beer in well after the incident ended. officer angeles testified that not all of the items mcmichael stole from the store and concealed in her purse were recovered in the parking lot. islas is correct that officer redshaw did not note in his police report that additional items were recovered from the islas and mcmichael, but he did testify to that fact. the jury was entitled to believe his testimony, as [r]esolution of conflicts and inconsistencies in the testimony is the exclusive province of the [jury] (young, supra, 34 cal.4th at p. 1181.) it was the jurygreater credibility to officer oned at the time force was used. further, the jury could accept officer beer although he did not report it. also, the jury could believe officer testimony. the jury needed only to believe one of these witnesses on the matter to convict islas of robbery. (ibid.) islas also argues that his conviction should be reversed because he lacked the intent to steal the property when he used force against officer vargas. officer vargas testified that islas grabbed his arm after -of-over her cross-body purse. against mcmichael. islas claims that if he intended to furthermore, he claims that mcmichael would not have thrown the items at vargas if their intent was to retain the items, nor would they have fled without the merchandise once vargas let go of 7 the purse. therefore, islas submits that the only was that he was protecting mcmichael from vargas. e, it is not the inference the jury motivated by the intent to steal. . . . (people v. anderson (2011) 51 cal.4th 989, 991-992.) even if the defendant did not intend to instill fear or use force against the victim, the court will still sustain a robbery conviction if fear or force existed. (ibid.) robbery is way to a place of te (people v. carroll (1970) 1 cal.3d 581, 585.) therefore, a defendant can be convicted of theft, even if the taking already occurred, if he or she uses force while attempting to escape. (estes, supra, 147 cal.app.3d at p. 28.) violence at any point in the commission of the crime will negate any peacefulness in the process. (people v. anderson, supra, 51 cal.4th at p. 994.) the jurythat islas used force at some point during the taking, moving, or escape with the property with the intent to steal the property. the jury examined the same facts that islas now presents and found it wanting. we must do so as well. disposition the judgment is affirmed. bigelow, p.j. we concur: flier, j. grimes, j.
