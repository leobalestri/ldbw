filed 5/15/12 p. v. wall ca2/8 not to be published in the official reports california rules of court, rule 8.1115(a), prohibits courts and parties from citing or relying on opinions not certified for publication or ordered published, except as specified by rule 8.1115(b). this opinion has not been certified for publication or ordered published for purposes of rule 8.1115. in the court of appeal of the state of california second appellate district division eight the people, plaintiff and respondent, v. william wall et al., defendants and appellants. b232286 (los angeles county super. ct. no. la066056) appeal from judgments of the superior court of los angeles county, michael k. kellogg, judge. affirmed. law offices of carl k. osborne and carl k. osborne for defendant and appellant william wall. law offices of michael l. galey and michael l. galey for defendant and appellant jesse kenyon boddie. kamala d. harris, attorney general, dane r. gillette, chief assistant attorney general, lance e. winters, assistant attorney general, victoria b. wilson, and jonathan j. kline, deputy attorneys general, for plaintiff and respondent. _________________________________ 2 after the trial court denied their joint motion to quash a search warrant, william wall pleaded no contest to possession of ammunition by a felon and possession of a deadly weapon (pen. code,  12316, subd. (b)(1), 12020, subd. (a)(1)), and jesse kenyon boddie pleaded no contest to possession of cocaine for sale, with a four-kilogram weight enhancement (health & saf. code,  11351, 11370.4, subd. (a)). boddie and denial of their motion to quash. we affirm. facts on may 18, 2010, wall purchased 50 rounds of 9-millimeter ammunition, 50 rounds of .38-caliber ammunition, 50 rounds of .357-caliber ammunition, and 20 rounds of .460-caliber ammunition at the firing-line indoor shooting range on eddy street in northridge. firing-los at some point, the form was forwarded to the los angeles police department (lapd). lapd received the ammunition registration form on may 25, 2010. on august 5, 2010, lapd officer jennifer rogers and her partner, detective j. they noted the may 18, 2010 entry by firing-chase of ammunition. officer rogers conducted a check on wall utilizing lapd resources and found that he was a convicted felon, including a conviction for being a felon in -stocompared a thumbprint on the ammunition registration form from firing-line against comparison showed that wall purchased the ammunition noted on the may 18, 2010 ammunition registration form received from firing-line. officer rogers also confirmed records showed that wall was placed on formal probation through november 2012, and had been ordered not to possess any deadly weapons, including firearms. 3 on september 10, 2010, officer rogers executed an affidavit in support of an application for a searresidence an apartment on oxnard street in north hollywood his vehicle, and his person.1 the application sought a search warrant authorizing police to search for issued the warrant. the probation reports provide the following information regarding the execution into custody. wall exited a bedroom and was also placed in custody. during the -caliber bullet from bedroom and the living room. in a second bedroom, police recovered five brick-shaped boddie. the brick-shaped objects contained a white, powdery substance resembling cocaine. in november 2010, the people filed an information jointly charging wall and boddie with possession of a controlled substance, cocaine, for sale (count 1; health & saf. code,  11351), with an allegation that the cocaine weighed more than four kilograms (health & saf. code,  11370.4, subd. (a)). further, the information charged wall with possession of ammunition by a felon (count 2; pen. code,  12316, pen. code,  k 12020, subd. (a)(1)). 1 information had been obtained from department of motor vehicle records. officers had 4 wall filed a written motion to quash the search warrant. boddie filed a notice of was not supported by probable cause. on february 8, 2011, the parties argued the motion to quash to the trial court. the er hould be likened more to the published cases in which searches for stolen property were that passage of time in his case from his purchase of ammunition (may 2010) until officer rogers submitted her affidavit for the search warrant (september 2010), defeated counsel. at the conclusion of the argument, the trial court denied the motion to quash. the e two [] would be residence. but the court found firearms and ammunition to be items of a different nature. even in the likelihood that the ammunition purchased in may had beat a firing range, it was still reasonable to conclude that wall possessed a firearm at his i clean the weapon, put [it] back in my case and take it back home from where it came. . . . [] . . . [] . . . so looking at the time frame, weapons have a history of remaining longer than do drugs. drugs are transitory [whereas] weapons even though 5 on february 16, 2011, wall waived his constitutional trial rights and pleaded no contest to possession of ammunition by a felon as charged in count 2, and possession of a deadly weapon as charged in count 3. boddie waived his constitutional trial rights and pleaded no contest to possession of cocaine for sale as charged in count 1 (health & saf. code,  11351) and admitted the weight enhancement allegation ( 11370.4, subd. (a)). on april 5, 2011, the trial court sentenced wall to an aggregate term of one year four months.2 counts 1 and 4 were dismissed pursuant to the plea negotiations. on april 12, 2011, the trial court sentenced boddie to an aggregate term of five years.3 wall and boddie filed timely notices of appeal. discussion i. staleness wall contends the trial court erred in denying his motion to quash because the in determining the sufficiency of an affidavit for the issuance of a search warrant, the test of probable cause is whether the facts in the affidavit would lead a person of ordinary caution and prudence to believe and conscientiously entertain a strong suspicion of the guilt of the accused. (people v. kraft (2000) 23 cal.4th 978, 1041.) the task of the issuing magistrate is to make a common-sense decision whether, given the information in the affidavit, there is a reasonable probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place. (ibid.) there is no bright-line, count-the-number-of-days rule defining the point at which information in an affidavit must be considered too stale to support probable cause; the question of staleness depends on the facts of each case. (people v. carrington (2009) 47 cal.4th 145, 163-165.) 2 the aggregate term consisted of a low term of one year four months for the possession of ammunition, and a concurrent low term of one year four months for the possession of a deadly weapon. 3 the aggregate term consisted of a low term of two years for possession of cocaine for sale, plus a three-year term for the weight enhancement pursuant to health and safety code section 11370.4, subdivision (a). 6 wall cites four cases in support of his staleness argument: hemler v. superior court (1975) 44 cal.app.3d 430 (hemler); durham v. united states (1968) 403 f.2d 190 (durham); sgro v. united states (1932) 287 u.s. 206 (sgro); and people v. hulland (2003) 110 cal.app.4th 1646 (hulland). in hemler, the court of appeal ruled that facts 34 days before the affidavit was submitted were stale and did not support the probable cause determination for a warrant to search the residence. (hemler, at pp. 432-435.) in durham, a search pursuant to a warrant resulted in the recovery of a $20 counterfeit bill and a plate for printing counterfeit money. (durham, at p. 192.) the court ruled that a delay of more than 17 weeks between the activity described in an affidavit for the search warrant and the search warrant itself was too long of a delay. (id. at p. 194.) sgro involved a case during the prohibition era. there, the united states supreme court ruled that a delay of 21 days between the sale of beer at a hotel and the ensuing affidavit and search warrant negated probable cause for believing that beer would still present as of the date of the search warrant. (srgo, supra, at pp. 210-211.) sgro involved a statutory interpretation issue under a federal search warrant statute, but its discussion of delay is related to the probable cause issue. hulland is another drug-related case. there, the trial court denied a motion to suppress, finding information in an affidavit was stale, but that the good faith exception applied. (hulland, at p. 1653, discussing united states v. leon (1984) 468 u.s. 897.) the court of appeal reversed, agreeing that information in an affidavit regarding activities in september was too stale to support a warrant issued in november (hulland, supra, at pp. 1649, 1652-1653), and then rejecting application of the good faith exception because the officer who executed the affidavit knew the information was stale. within the same framework as hemler, sgro, and hulland. although durham is closer, we nonetheless agree with the people that the nature of the evidence involved in a search warrant here, in particular, firearms is the factor that carries the day. in our view, 7 approved in cases such as u.s. v. neal (8th cir. 2008) 528 f.3d 1069, u.s. v. kennedy (8th cir. 2005) 427 f.3d 1136, 1142, and united states v. bowers (9th cir. 1976) 534 f.2d 186. neal, kennedy and bowers teach that information concerning someone who is neal, supra, at p. 1074; see also kennedy, supra, at p. 1142, fn. 5 & bowers, supra, at pp. 192-193 [it is probable not support a reasonable probable cause determination. rejected. ii. omission of fact wall contends the trial court erred in denying his motion to quash because officer gistrate that police received information as early as may 25, 2010, the date on which the lapd received the ammunition registration form from firing-line, which indicated that wall was involved in criminal activity.4 we disagree that the omission, if any, commands that the search warrant be quashed. a defendant who challenges a search warrant based on an alleged omission in the affidavit bears the burden of showing an intentional or reckless omission of material fact that, when added to the affidavit, renders it insufficient to support a finding of probable cause. (people v. scott (2011) 52 cal.4th 452, 484.) an omitted fact may be deemed material when there is a substantial probability that the fact, if disclosed, would have changed a reasonable magistmakes the affidavit substantially misleading. (people v. kurland (1980) 28 cal.3d 376, 385.) 4 at the hearing on the motion to quash, the parties agreed that the lapd received the ammunition registration forms on may 25, 2010. 8 we do not see a material omission, or an omission of any measurably significance. s affidavit disclosed that the ammunition registration form was dated may 18, 2010, and that she first saw the form on august 5, 2010. even if the affidavit stated the further fact that the police received the form on may 25, 2010, we see no possibility tdetermination. we see no relevance to the date upon which lapd received the ammunition registration form. the important dates for probable cause are the date the ammunition was bought, the date officer rogers submitted her affidavit for the search warrant, and the date the magistrate found probable cause and issued the warrant. this information was available to the magistrate. we see no grounds for reversal of the trial cision denying the motion to quash based on an alleged omission in officer rejected. iii. the good faith exception because we have found that the search warrant was properly issued, we need not (see united states v. leon, supra, 468 u.s. 897) to justify the search on a warrant issued pursuant to an allegedly insufficient affidavit. are rejected. iv. suppression of the cocaine boddie contends the cocaine should have been suppressed because the location where it was found was outside the scope of the warrant and no exception to the requirement of a warrant existed. we disagree. first, boddie forfeited any claim that the police wrongly looked in the duffel bag in the bedroom where he was staying. he did not raise this duffel bag search issue in the of lack of probable cause. it would be unfair to both the prosecution and the trial court to 9 address an issue not presented at the hearing on the motion to quash. the prosecution did not have an opportunity to respond to the issue and the court did not have an opportunity to rule on the issue. (people v. williams (1999) 20 cal.4th 119, 136; see also people v. garcia (2003) 111 cal.app.4th 715, 720.) assuming boddie did not forfeit his claim that the police exceeded the scope of the warrant, we find no error in not suppressing the cocaine. the scope of a permissible search pursuant to a warrant is determined by its language. (people v. balint (2006) 138 cal.app.4th 200, 207.) officers executing a search warrant may be called upon in certain situations to interpret the scope of the warrant, but they are not required to interpret it narrowly. on the contrary, a search pursuant to an interpreted search warrant is proper if ibid.) search is to include all rooms . . . warrant, and see no evidence in the record, indicating that the police were on notice that wall did not have control over the whole the apartment. (see people v. govea (1965) 235 cal.app.2d 285, 300 [a search by police of an entire residence pursuant to a warrant identifying the residence was within the scope of the warrant as to an occupant because nothing on the face of the warrant indicated that the residence was more than a single living unit, or that it included a separate dwelling area for the occupant].) we see no evidence in the record, for example, indicating that boddie was a co-lessee of the oxnard street apartment, or a sub-lessee of wall, or that he told police he had control over the second bedroom. there is no evidence in the record that boddie was had anything other than an unlucky, transient visitor in the apartment when the police executed the search warrant.5 the on- was reasonable and did not exceed the scope of the search warrant. 5 there are comments by the lawyers at the hearing on the motion to quash that the nd that boddie had been staying in the bedroom for a couple of days when the search warrant was executed. 10 motion to suppress the cocaine as the fruit of a search that exceeded the scope of the search warrant. disposition the judgments are affirmed. bigelow, p. j. we concur: rubin, j. grimes, j.
