(pen. code,  12022.53, subd. (b).) before judgment became final, two statutory changes took effect which, if applied retroactively, potentially ameliorate his punishment: (1) the electorate passed the public safety and rehabilitation act of 2016 (proposition 57), which eliminated a against a juvenile directly in adult court; and (2) the legislature amended penal code section 12022.53, subdivision (h), to permit courts to strike or dismiss a firearm enhancement in furtherance of justice. we conclude that these changes apply retroactively to thomas and, therefore, conditionally reverse the judgment with the directions set forth below. factual and procedural summary in 2013, the district attorney filed an information charging thomas with two counts of robbery (counts 1 and 2; pen. code,  211), one count of attempted robbery (count 3; pen. code,  664 & 211), and one count of carrying an unregistered loaded firearm (count 4; pen. code,  25850, subd. (a)). the information further alleged that thomas, in committing the robberies, personally used a firearm within the meaning of penal code section 12022.53, subdivision (b). thomas pleaded no contest to the charges and admitted the firearm allegation. the court sentenced thomas to 17 years 10 months in prison s belief that the prison sentences on counts 2 and 3 had to run consecutively to the sentence on count 1. 3 the sentence included a 10-year prison term imposed for the firearm enhancement under penal code section 12022.53, subdivision (b). thomas appealed and, in an unpublished opinion filed in may 2016, we held that the court had discretion to impose concurrent sentences on counts 2 and 3, and reversed the judgment ence with full awareness of its 1 (people v. thomas (may 24, 2016, b259783) [nonpub. opn.], quoting people v. fuhrman (1997) 16 cal.4th 930, 944.) at a sentencing hearing held in december 2016, the court ordered the sentence on count 2 to run concurrently to the sentence on count 1, imposed consecutive sentences on counts 3 and 4, and again imposed the 10-year sentence on the firearm enhancement. the revised total prison term is 14 years 4 months. thomas timely appealed. discussion i. retroactivity of proposition 57 on november 8, 2016, the california voters passed proposition 57, which became effective the next day. (see cal. const., art. ii,  10, subd. (a).) as a result, minors can now be tried juvenile court judge conducts a transfer hearing to consider various factors such as the maturity, degree of criminal sophistication, prior delinquent people v. superior court (lara) (2018) 4 cal.5th 299, 305-306 (lara), quoting people v. vela (2017) 11 cal.app.5th 68, 72 (vela), review granted 1 notice of the record and our unpublished opinion in his prior appeal, case no. b259783. 4 july 12, 2017 and vacated on other grounds feb. 28, 2018, s242298.) if the juvenile court does not transfer the case to adult court and thereafter adjudicates the petition in the juvenile court, the court may declare the minor a ward of the court based on a finding that the minor committed the alleged offenses. (welf. & inst. code,  602 & 725, subd. (b).) in that event, the court does not impose the punishment applicable to adults who violated the same statute; instead, it makes a dispositional order intended to treat and rehabilitate the minor. (see welf. & inst. code,  725, 727, 730, 731 & 1700; people v. smith (2003) 110 cal.app.4th 1072, 1080.) in determining an appropriate dispositional order, the court must consider, among other relevant material, the age of the minor, the circumstances and gravity of the s previous delinquent history. (welf. & inst. code,  725.5.) in lara, supra, 4 cal.5th 299, our supreme court considered can be tried as an adult applies to [the] defendant even though he had already been charged in adult court before proposition 57 took id. at p. 306.) the court concluded that the transfer hearing provision of proposition 57 applied retroactively and that the defendant was therefore entitled to such a hearing. (id. at p. 309.) the lara court relied on in re estrada (1965) 63 cal.2d 740 (estrada), which established a presumption of retroactivity when a statute is amended to reduce the punishment for a prohibited act. the estrada rule, the in the absence of contrary indications, a legislative body ordinarily intends for ameliorative changes to the criminal law to extend as broadly as possible, distinguishing only as necessary between (lara, supra, 4 cal.5th at p. 308.) although proposition 57 did not reduce the punishment f 5 (ibid.) although the defendant in lara, unlike thomas, had only been charged in adult court and had not yet been convicted when proposition 57 was passed, laraall persons whose judgments were not yet final when the initiative became effective. (see lara, supra, 4 cal.5th at pp. 307-308.) indeed, the lara court relied oin vela, supra, 11 cal.app.5th 68, which held that proposition 57 applied retroactively to a defendant who had been convicted of crimes before proposition 57 passed. (see lara, supra, 4 cal.5th at p. 311 we infer that the electorate intended the possible ameliorating benefits of proposition 57 to apply to every minor to whom it may constitutionally apply vela, supra, 11 cal.app.5th at p. 81.) although the vela court held that proposition 57 applied entitled to an unconditional reversawell as its true findings as to the sentencing enhancements, will remain in place. nothing is to be gained by havinvela, supra, 11 cal.app.5th at p. 81.) the court then set forth the was juvenile court was conduct a juvenile e and institutions code section court shall, to the extent possible, treat the matter as though the prosecutor had originally filed a juvenile petition in juvenile court and had then moved to transfer [the dof criminal jurisdiction. ([wel. & inst. code, ] 707, subd. (a)(1).) if, after conducting the juvenile transfer hearing, the court determines that it would have transferred [the defendant] to a court of criminal 6 and proper subject to be dealt convictions and sentence are to be reinstated. ([wel. & inst. code, ] 707.1, subd. (a).) on the other hand, if the juvenile court finds that it would not have transferred [the defendant] to a court of criminal jurisdiction, then it shall treat [his] convictions as juvenile adjudications and impose an appropriate vela, supra, 11 cal.app.5th at p. 82.) in lara, the supreme court acknowledged that velaremedy lara, supra, 4 cal.5th at p. 313.) in light of vela and lara, thomas is entitled to a similar remedy.2 ii. retroactivity of amendment to penal code section 12022.53, subdivision (h). al court was required to impose the firearm enhancements under penal code section 12022.53. (former pen. code,  12022.53, subd. (h); people v. woods (2018) 19 cal.app.5th 1080, 1090 (woods).)3 while this 2 lara was decided after the attorney general filed the invited the attorney general to file a supplemental brief discussing the effect of lara on this case. the attorney general filed a supplemental brief and concedes that, in light of lara approval of the remedy in vela, proposition 57 applies to thomas and that the judgment should be conditionally reversed. 3 at the time the court sentenced thomas in december 2016, penal code, section 12022.53, subdivision (h) provided: notwithstanding [penal code] section 1385 or any other provision of law, the court shall not strike an allegation under this section or a finding bringing a person within the provisions of this section.(stats. 2010, ch. 711,  5.) 7 appeal was pending, the legislature amended subdivision (h) of [t]he court may, in the interest of justice pursuant to [penal code] section 1385 and at the time of sentencing, strike or dismiss an enhancement otherwise required to be pen. code,  12022.53, subd. (h); stats. 2017, ch. 682,  2.)4 the estrada rule, discussed in the preceding section, applies to amendments that do not necessarily punishment but which give the trial court discretion to impose a lesser sentence. (people v. francis (1969) 71 cal.2d 66, 75-76.) courts that have considered whether the amendment to penal code section 12022.53, subdivision (h), applies retroactively have concluded that it does. (see woods, supra, 19 cal.app.5th at p. 1091; people v. robbins (2018) 19 cal.app.5th 660, 679.) in woodsreflects a legislative determination that the previous bar on striking firearm enhancements was too severe, and that trial courts should instead have the power to strike those enhancements in the interest of justice. moreover, because there is nothing in the amendment to suggest any legislative intent that the amendment would apply prospectively only, we must presume that the legislature intended the amendment to apply to every case to which it constitutionally 4 under penal code section 1385, the court may, on its own motion , strike particular enhancement allegations against a defendant. (people v. superior court (romero) (1996) 13 cal.4th 497, 508; people v. thomas (1992) 4 cal.4th 206, 20efendant has no right to make a motion . . . under [penal code] section 1385, the defendant does r by an application to strike a count or allegation of an accusatory pleading, and the court must consider evidence offered by the defendant in support of his assertion that the dismissal would be in furtherance of justice.people v. carmony (2004) 33 cal.4th 367, 375.) 8 woods, supra, 19 cal.app.5th at p. 1091.) we agree. the attorney general concedes that the amendment to penal code section 12022.53, subdivision (h) applies retroactively to thomas, but contends that a further sentencing hearing is expressly refused to strike the hearing. the attorney general relies on people v. gutierrez (1996) 48 cal.app.4th 1894, 1896, which held that a resentencing hearing at which the court could exercise discretion to strike an allegation was unnecessary when the record shows that the sentencing court clearly indicated that it would not, in any event, have exercised its discretion to (id. at p. 1896.) here, tiking ime of sentencing, however, the court did not have the authority to strike a gun enhancement allegation. it is possible, as the attorney general asserts, that the court was expressing its view that it would not strike a gun enhancement if it had the authority to do so; but it is also possible that the court was aware that it could not strike the gun enhancements and would not, therefore, consider it. because the that the court will decline to exercise its discretion to moreover, as our supreme court has explained in a similar situation, because striking a gun enhancement was not possible at never enjoyed a full and fair opportunity to marshal and present the case supporting 9 a favorable exercise of disc (people v. rodriguez (1998) 17 cal.4th 253, 258.) thomas is entitled to that opportunity. accordingly, if the juvenile court determines that the cause would have been transferred to adult court pursuant to welfare and institutions code section 707, the adult court should have the opportunity to exercise its discretion to strike the firearm enhancements.5 5 the parties did not raise any issue concerning the retroactivity and applicability of the recent amendment to penal code section 12022.53, subdivision (h). pursuant to government code section 68081, we directed the parties to file supplemental briefs addressing the issue. we have received and considered such briefs. 10 disposition the judgment is conditionally reversed. the juvenile court shall hold a hearing pursuant to welfare and institutions code section 707 no later than 90 days from the filing of the remittitur or, for good cause, within a reasonable time thereafter. if the juvenile court declines to transfer thomas to adult court, it shall treat his convictions in adult court as juvenile adjudications and make an appropriate disposition. if, however, the juvenile court transfers thomas to adult court, the adult court shall have an opportunity to exercise its discretion to strike or dismiss the firearm enhancement pursuant to penal code section 12022.53, subdivision (h). if the court declines to exercise its discretion in this manner, the judgment and sentence shall be reinstated; if the court strikes or dismisses the firearm enhancements, the court shall pronounce judgment based on the new sentence. not to be published. rothschild, p. j. we concur. chaney, j. bendix, j.* * judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
