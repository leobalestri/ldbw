(b) & (e)(1)). on appeal, defendant challenges f evidence that the robbery victim and his mother received accordingly affirm. facts and procedural background i. facts six men accosted two seventh graders as they were walking in highland park to get dinner. one of the men issued a gang challenge, asking, proclaiming either, , s the avenues are a gang in highland park. when one of the boys, edward, declined to state a gang affiliation, the man who challenged them asked if edward or his friend had any money, and then asked edward to hand over the skateboard he was holding in his hand. when edward refused, the man reached toward his waistband and lifted up his shirt, making it possible for edward to see neither edward nor his friend actually saw the gun itself, but both right there in their waistband the man repeated his demand for skateboard. fearing that he would be shot, edward handed over the skateboard. one of the other men in the group then , the boys took this advice, and quickly left the area. the boys called the police. within minutes, police arrived at the street where the boys reported the robbery had occurred. the police gave chase on foot to a man who fled at the sight of the police car and pursued that man into a backyard party. at the party, 1 all further statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise indicated. 3 one of the police officers saw defendant and jose pereira (pereira) each throw a handgun over the fence into the neighboring yard. the police retrieved the weapons and determined that they were both loaded. friend consistently identified defendant as the man who demanded who made the gestures toward his waist, and who took the skateboard. the friend did so at a field show-up immediates arrest as well as at trial. at the field show-up, edward identified defendant; during his preliminary hearing testimony, edward testified that he could not identify defendant and denied that he had identified defendant at the field show-up; and at trial, edward testified that defendant [ed] and admitted to having identified defendant at the field show-up. ii. procedural history the people charged defendant with (1) second degree robbery ( 211), (2) having a concealed firearm on his person ( 25400, subd. (a)(2)), and (3) carrying a loaded, unregistered firearm ( 25850, subd. (a)).2 as to the second degree robbery, the people further alleged that defendant was armed with a firearm ( 12022, subd. (a)(1)) and personally used a firearm ( 12022.53, subds. (b) & (e)(1)). the people additionally alleged that all three crimes were committed for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with a criminal street gang ( 186.22, subd. (b)(1)(a)). the jury convicted defendant of all three crimes, and found true the firearm and gang allegations. the trial court sentenced defendant to a 15-year prison term. the court selected the second degree robbery count as the base count, selected a five-year base sentence and firearm enhancement in the interests of justice. the court imposed a three-year prison sentence on the concealed firearm count, but ran it concurrently with the robbery sentence. the 2 the people also charged pereira with the same crimes, but his appeal is not before us. 4 court also imposed a three-year sentence on the loaded firearm count, but stayed it pursuant to section 654. defendant filed a timely notice of appeal. discussion i. substantial evidence section 12022.53, subdivision (b) requires a court to impose an additional, consecutive 10-53, subds. (a)(4) & e evidence, our task is assess substantial evidencethat is, evidence that is reasonable, credible, and of solid valuefrom which a reasonable trier of fact could find the defendant guilty [of the enhancement] beyond a reasonable doubt.people v. livingston (2012) 53 cal.4th 1145, 1170, quoting people v. albillar (2010) 51 cal.4th 47, 59-60.) in undertaking this assessment, we view the record in the light most finding. (livingston, at p. 1170.) over 40 years ago, our supreme court epeople v. chambers (1972) 7 cal.3d 666, 672.) thus, alvarado v. superior court (2007) 146 cal.app.4th 993, 1001; people v. bryant (2011) 191 cal.app.4th 1457, 1472.) although there is no one definition of facilitative conduct (e.g., people v. wardell (2008) )gun [is] aimed at the victim, intepeople v. smit (2014) 224 cal.app.4th 977, 987-988, quoting 5 people v. jacobs (1987) 193 cal.app.3d 375, 381require that the defendant show the firearm or touch the firearm (bryant, at p. 1472; alvarado, at p. 1004), and does not require that the victim see the firearm (people v. granado (1996) 49 cal.app.4th 317, 326-327 (granado); alvarado, at p. 1004; jacobs, at pp. 380-into play. (granado, at pp. 325, 327; people v. hajek and vo (2014) 58 cal.4th 1144, 1198, overruled in part on other grounds by people v. rangel (2016) 62 cal.4th 1192.) (chambers, at p. 672; hajek and vo, at p. 1198.) applying these principles, when a defendant puts a gun in his waistband, pulls it out while making a demand, and puts it back. (granado, supra, 49 cal.app.4th at p. 325; people v. johnson (1995) 38 cal.app.4th 1315, 1317-1318, 1320-1321 (johnson)puts a gun in his people v. monjaras (2008) 164 cal.app.4th 1432, 1436 (monjaras); people v. colligan (1979) 91 cal.app.3d 846, 849, 851 (colligan).) there is substantial evidence upon which a jury could reasonably conclude that evidence that defendant possessed a real gun because he was seen tossing an actual, loaded gun over a fence just minutes after he accosted edward and his friend. there is granado, johnson, monjaras and colligan, defendant placed his gun in his waistband. although neither edward nor his friend directly saw any part of the gun, edward testified that he saw the toward his waistband and lifting his shirt as he was demanding the skateboard. defendanhis willingness to back up his verbal demands with gun violence, and it is a message that both edward and his friendby their conduct at the time and in their subsequent testimonyheard loud and clear. in sum, 6 defendant made the presence of the gun known and to ; in so doing, he defendant to . . . rgues he did not have a real gun, the jury heard substantial evidence to the contrary. to the extent standard, including what he perceives as the heavy, 10-year sentence for this enhancement. but this is an argument for our legislature. we will adhere to the ii. evidentiary error to testify regarding a threatening text message and a threatening phone call she received. the day before tthe mother told edward about the text message. a month before the trial began, the mother received a phone call in which an unknown male sgang. the trial court instructed the jury that evidence relating to that message and call was s on the state of mind of the recipient defendant argues that the trial court erred in admitting evidence of these threats because there was no evidence tying him to the threats. for support, he cites people v. hannon (1977) 19 cal.3d 588, 598-599 (hannon) and people v. weiss (1958) 50 cal.2d 535, 553-554 (weissan abuse of discretion. (people v. sanchez (2016) 63 cal.4th 411, 456.) 7 the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting evidence of the threatening text and phone call. hannon and weiss prohibit a court from admitting evidence of threats made to witnesses unless the defendant himself made the threats or directed that they be made, but this prohibition applies when the evidence is being admitted to show hannon, supra, 19 cal.3d at pp. 598-599; weiss, supra, 50 cal.2d at p. 554.) this rule makes sense: if the defendant is not somehow personally responsible for a threat, it is not relevant to show his consciousness of guilt. however, evidence that a witness has been threatened can also show that the witness is afraid to testify or feais relevant to the (people v. adams (2014) 60 cal.4th 541, 570, quoting people v. mendoza (2011) 52 cal.4th 1056, 1084 (mendoza); people v. burgener (2003) [a]n explanation of the basis for the witnrelevant to her credibilitythis purpose, it does not matter whether the threat is linked to the defendant because the threat affects the egardless of its source. (mendozathe witness, whether or not the threat is directly linked to the defendantpeople v. abel (2012) 53 cal.4th 891, 925; people v. olguin (1994) 31 cal.app.4th 1355, 1368.) the message; the phone call bears on the absence of evidence to the contrary (and there is none here), (people v. capistrano (2014) 59 cal.4th 830, 869), the absence of any link between the threats and defendant does not call into question the admissibility of the threats. defendant makes two arguments in response. first, he contends that there is insufficient evidence that the threats scared edward because edward disclaimed being the preliminary hearing was inconsistent with his statements to the police immediately 8 after the robbery as well as his subsequent trial testimony. a witntestimony is not a prerequisite to admission of evidence regarding threats, (mendoza, supra, 52 cal.4th at p. 1086), but it exists here. second, defendant seems to suggest that admitting evidence of threats made by other anonymous gang members violates evidence code section 352 because gang objecting on this basis below. (evid. code,  353.) the argument lacks merit in any event. a trial court may exclude evidence under evidence code section 352 if, among ability that its admission will . . . create substantial danger of undue prejudice, of confusing the issues, or of misleading threats, but also more chiefly to the gang enhancement the people charged. as a result, the probative value of the gang evidence was substantial and its undue prejudice relatively minor vis--vis its relevance to the threats. at a minimum, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the evidence under evidence code section 352. disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. _______________________, j. hoffstadt we concur: _______________________, acting p.j. ashmann-gerst _______________________, j. chavez
