(2) $6,718.88 in september 2010; (3) $5,903.64 in october 2010; and (4) $6,017.78 in november bank records corroborated 3. defen2011 from january to august 2011, defendant could not earn more than $1,984 per month to qualify for food stamps. from september through december 2011, the limit was $2,008 per month. each of the reports defendant submitted attested that she was below the respective figures. defendant submitted her next quarterly report in january 2011, indicating she earned $500 per month from diverse journeys and $500 in self-employment income. in may 2011, defendant signed and returned another quarterly report. in it, she declared under penalty of perjury that the gross amount of her self-employment income was $750, that she had additional income of $234.75, and that her foster care income was $815. in july 2011, defendant reported under penalty of perjury that she earned $950 in self-employment income and $815 from foster care income. in the fall of 2011, defendant submitted a quarterly report attesting that her self-employment income for september 2011 was $850 and that her foster care income was $990. defendant continued to receive food stamps. 5 self-employed income was significantly greater than the amount she claimed in her 2011 quarterly reports to dpss. crystal stairs made the following in 2011: (1) $6,472.45 in january; (2) $4,848.28 in february; (3) $2,871.80 in march; (4) $4,132.97 in april; (5) $6,823.61 in may; (6) $4,032.74 in june; (7) $3,871.74 in july; (8) $6,969.85 in august; (9) $5,121.97 in september; (10) $3,779.59 in october; (11) $441.35 in november; and (12) $1,722.96 in december. 4. 2012 from january to august 2012, defendant could not earn more than $2,008 per month to qualify for food stamps. from september through december 2012, the maximum was $2,069. in february 2012, defendant signed under penalty of perjury and returned to dpss her quarterly report stating that she earned $990 for foster care and $860 for self-employment in december 2011. in april 2012, defendant submitted her march 2012 quarterly report attesting under penalty of perjury that her march 2012 income consisted of $990 for foster care and $845 in self-employment. defendant more in self-employment income than she claimed in her first two 2012 quarterly reports: (1) $1,185.32 in january 2012; (2) $2,049.50 in february 2012; (3) $1,777.25 in march 2012; (4) $1,769.69 in april 2012; (5) $1,769.69 in may 2012; and confirmed these deposits. 6 5. 2013 from january to september 2013, the maximum monthly income allowed to food stamp recipients was $2,069. from october through december 2013, it was $2,116 per month. in food stamps had been terminated for failure to file a complete quarterly report, defendant again applied for food stamps, attesting that she received a total of $1,759 in income ($1,009 of foster care income and $750 in self-employment income). she signed the document under penalty of perjury. crystal stairs payment records showed that it paid defendant in 2013: (1) $2,665.20 in january; (2) $2,292.50 in february; (3) $1,225.77 in march; (4) $1,352.97 in april; (5) $1,426.02 in may; (6) $4,045.19 in june; (7) $3,114.43 in july; (8) $3,674.95 in august; (9) $1,931.54 in september; (10) $1,708.02 in october; (11) $1,412.82 in november; and (12) these transfers. 6. criminal proceedings in an information filed in february 2015, the people charged defendant with one count of aid by misrepresentation and five counts of perjury by false application for aid. count 1 2010. counts 3, 4, and 5 income reporting in 2011, 2012, and 2013. (a sixth count was filed but later dismissed.) defendant pleaded not guilty. a dpss eligibility computation clerk, who specialized in welfare fraud investigations, infraud. in anticipation of trial, she prepared an analysis in 7 showing the amount of food stamps paid, and other relevant dpss materials. the clerk determined that dpss overpaid defendant $10,694. application and forms filed with dpss to obtain food stamps, as well as an employee of crystal stairs, who testified about ive-page initial food stamps application to introduce into evidence. rather, the dpss intake worker, who met with and handled her application. the intake worker also explained the information she provided defendant when defendant was filing the application. defendant introduced testimony from another dpss employee who had commenced a dpss fraud investigation into defendant in 2015. this employee closed the case because she discovered there was another open investigation of defendant, and noted that as far as her own fraud investigation was concerned, she had uncovered no fraud. defendant also testified on her own behalf. she stated that when she applied for food stamps, she did not understand the rules for reporting her income and deductions. when dpss informed her about the 40 percent standard deduction for self-employed applicants, defendant thought that it meant she was being awarded 40 percent less aid because of her self-employment. she stated that the amount she reported as her income on the october 2010 quarterly report was what she 8 paying her business expenses. defendant did not report the full trial repeated on appeal was that she lacked the requisite intent to commit the crimes because she failed to comprehend the deduction rules for self-employed individuals applying for food stamps, and thus did not intentionally make false statements. 7. the jury found defendant guilty as charged in counts 1 through 5. for count 1, the court sentenced defendant to 45 days in county jail and three years of formal probation. the court imposed an identical sentence for counts 2 through 5 and ordered them to run concurrently. discussion defendant contends that insufficient evidence supports her convictions for aid by misrepresentation and perjury by false application for aid specifically that the prosecution did not prove that she intentionally made a false application or committed perjury. 1. standard of review iew the whole record in the light most favorable to the judgment to determine whether it discloses substantial evidencethat is, evidence that is reasonable, credible, and of solid valuefrom which a reasonable trier of fact could find the defendant guilty beyond a re [citation.] . .

(people v. park (2003) 112 cal.app.4th 61, 68.) 2. convictions defendant does not dispute that she earned more income than she reported to dpss. rather, defendant argues that the prosecution failed to prove that she possessed the intent to commit aid by misrepresentation and perjury by false application for aid. conviction for aid by misrepresentation requires that the y and knowingly, 10980, subd.

(people v. zamudio (2008) 43 cal.4th 327, 357-358.) communalthough she did not specifically recall meeting with defendant (as she sees eight to 10 welfare applicants per day) she advised 11 defendant, as she tells all self-employed applicants, about the deductions and how to properly fill out the application. again, defendant disputes the weight of t`he evidence, which we do not address on appeal.
