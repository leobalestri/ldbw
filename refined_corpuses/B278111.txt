(b)) and had conviction within the meaning of our three strikes law ( 667, subds. (b)-(j) & 1170.12). 3 ii. probation violation in july 2016, defendant admitted that he was in violation of the conditions of his probation because he had (1) not obeyed all laws (as he had been arrested on a new burglary charge in riverside county in july 2016), and (2) not enrolled in a mental health program. the court revoked probation and imposed the previously suspended sentence of two years in state prison, with credit for 411 days time served. iii. motion to withdraw admission of probation violation & appeal in august 2016, defendant filed a motion to withdraw his probation violation admission. the trial court denied the motion, and defendant brought this appeal after obtaining a certificate of probable cause. iv. postappeal proceedings in october 2016, the trial court to reinstate probation to place him into a residential treatment program. after not enrolling in the program, defendant in january 2017, admitted he was in violation of his probation, and the court revoked probation and reimposed the two-year prison sentence less 659 days of custody creditsnamely, (1) 365 days for the jail term, (2) 238 days (119 actual plus 119 credit) for the time he was in custody between the first revocation and the reinstatement, and (3) 56 days (28 actual plus 28 credit) for the time he was in custody awaiting the second revocation hearing. defendant was released from custody on february 10, 2017, and placed in postrelease community supervision. discussion defendant raises three challenges to his revocation and sentence: (1) his admission of the probation violation is invalid; 4 (2) he was sentenced twice for the same probation revocation; and (3) the trial court incorrectly calculated his custody credits. merit. although . . . his notice of appeal, he provides no argumentfactual or legalon this issue in his supplemental brief. this amounts to a waiver. (people v. bryant, smith and wheeler (2014) 60 cal.4th 335, 363-364.) further, we have reviewed the transcript for his admission of the probation violation, and independently conclude that the waiver was knowing and voluntarily. ( 1203.2, subds. (a), (b)(1), 1203.3, subd. (b), 3000.08; see people v. rodriguez (1990) 51 cal.3d 437, 446-447 [burden of proof is preponderance of the evidence].) defendhe was not sentenced two times for the same probation violation. rather, his probation was revoked; it was reinstated at his request; and then it was revoked again when he did not comply with the terms of reinstatement. what is more, the court gave defendant custody credit for the time he spent in custody between the time of the first revocation and the reinstatement. credits is both moot and without merit. it is moot because defendant was released from custody on the revocation on february 10, 2017. (see, e.g., people v. valencia (2014) 226 cal.app.4th 326, 329 [attack on custody credits moot where defendant is released from custody absent further parole period or fines imposed].) defendant counters that he is still in custody; he is, but he is in custody for a violation of his postrelease community supervision (see people v. rager (super. ct. l.a. county, 2017, no. 7pr01268)), which is a separate proceeding 5 (see  3455). by definition, any period of custody that is part of postrelease community supervision is discrete from custody served prior to release. even if we ignore the mootness of this issue, defendant is incorrect that he was entitled to additional credits. if anything, he was entitled to fewer credits because the trial court erroneously gave him credit for the full 365-day jail term he was supposed to serve rather than the 84-day jail term he did serve (along with an additional 84 days of conduct credits). disposition the order is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. ______________________, j. hoffstadt we concur: _________________________, acting p. j. chavez _________________________, j.* goodman * retired judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
