(a))2 and two counts of attempted premeditated murder ( 664/187, subd. (a)). the jury found that in all three offenses he personally used and intentionally discharged a firearm within the meaning of section 12022.53, subdivisions (b) through (e), and that the offenses were committed for the benefit of a criminal street gang ( 186.22) in march 2011, mcguire was sentenced to an aggregate state prison term of 90 years to life.3 among the issues raised in his first appeal, mcguire contended his sentence constituted cruel and unusual punishment under the eighth amendment because he was only 17 years old at the time of the crimes. we reversed the sentence and remanded for resentencing after concluding the trial court had failed to consider the factors identified in miller v. alabama (2012) 567 u.s. __ [132 s.ct. 2455, 183 l.ed.2d 407] (miller) and 1 (august 19, 2009) he would have been 17 years and 1 month. 2 statutory references are to the penal code, unless otherwise indicated. 3 mcguire was tried jointly with taylor, who was found guilty of one count of first degree murder and two counts of attempted premeditated murder. the jury found that in all three offenses, a principal personally used and intentionally discharged a firearm within the meaning of section 12022.53, subdivisions (b) through (e) and they were committed for the benefit of a criminal street gang ( 186.22, subd. (b)(1)(c)). taylor was sentenced to an aggregate state prison term of 82 years to life. 3 people v. caballero (2012) 55 cal.4th 262 (caballero) in imposing sentence. (people v. mcguire (july 15, 2013, b232593) [nonpub. opn.].) at the resentencing hearing on remand, the trial court indicated it had reviewed the relevant cases, among them miller and caballeroc4 prior to imposing sentence for murder, count 1, the the offense, not 15 or 16. his level of involvement was high and extremely connected, involved. and based upon in carrying out these three offenses. specifically, it was found he personally used a handgun and fired more than one time. there were numerous shorts [sic] towards the direction of numerous victims. there is nothing that indicated he has any sort of physical, mental or emotional health problems. he is not a small young man. he did the court offense. the trial court also considered the fact that section 3051 would provide mcguire with an opportunity to seek parole in 25 years. the trial court then sentenced mcguire to an aggregate state prison term of 50 years to life: a term of 25 years to life for murder (count 1), plus a term of 25 years to life for the firearm-use enhancement. with respect to the attempted murders, counts 2 and 3, the court statover my notes and what happened as the events occurred reflecting these convictions, all single period of abhorrent behavior on the part of mr. mcguire, i tobjective was to facilitate, instigate and continue the gang warfare that was going on at that time between the two gangs involved. and again, making sure that the record idering the factors of his age 4 both parties urged the court to delay sentencing until the california supreme court decided the relevant issues pending before it. (see infra.) the court declined the proffered stipulation. 4 considering that as well in determining that these offenses as to count 2 and 3 should run concurrent. and i think this will provide a meaningful opportunity for [mcguire] to obtain his release based on any subsequent rehabilitation. granted, it will be late in his life, but at least there will be some opportunity. and again, the court has considered the social and psychological factors that make juveniles less culpable than adults. that is the court then imposed two concurrent terms of 25 years to life on count 1 plus 25 years to life for the firearm-use enhancement with a concurrent sentence of life, with a fifteen year minimum parole eligibility plus 25 years to life for firearm enhancement on each of count 2 and count 3. mcguire timely appealed, again contending his sentence violated the eighth amendment prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment. discussion 1. relevant legal principles in miller, supra, 132 s.ct. at p. 2460, the united states supreme court held the eighth amendment prohibits the imposition of a mandatory sentence of life without the possibility of parole (lwop) for a juvenile who commits murder. (miller, supra, 132 s.ct. at p. 2460.) while not imposing a categorical ban, the court explained that roper [v. simmons (2005) 543 u.s. 551], graham [v. florida and heightened capacity for change, we think appropriate occasions for sentencing juveniles to this harshest possible penalty will be uncommon. that is especially so because of the great difficulty we noted in roper and graham of distinguishing at this [citations.] homicide cases, we require it to take into account how children are different, and how those differences counsel against irrevocably sentencing them to a lifetime in (id. at p. 2469.) 5 the miller court set forth five categories of factors which the trial court is to consider in determining whether an lwop sentence is warranted: (1) the juvenile offenders among them, immaturity, environment that surrounds [the juvenile]and from which he cannot usually extricate himselfumstances of the been charged and convicted of a lesser offense if not for incompetencies associated with youthfor example, his inability to deal with police officers or prosecutors (including on a plea agreement) or his incapacity to assist hipossibility of rehabilitation, for which the absence or existence of a criminal history is relevant. (id. at pp. 2468-2469.) in graham v. florida (2010) 560 u.s. 48, 82 [130 s.ct. 2011, 176 l.ed.2d 825] (graham) , the united states supreme court held a categorical ban on sentences of life without parole for juvenile offenders applies to all nonhomicide cases including a term of years sentence that is the functional equivalent of an lwop sentence. in caballero, supra, 55 cal.4th at p. 268, the california supreme court applied the principals of miller and graham to hold that an aggregate determinate sentence of 110 years for a 16-year-old, who was convicted of three gang-related attempted murders, was the functional equivalent of an lwop sentence, and violated requirement (caballero, at p. 268, quoting graham, 560 u.s. at p. 82.) finally, in people v. gutierrez (2014) 58 cal.4th 1354, the california supreme court revisited the issue, addressing the question of whether section 190.5 establishes a presumption in favor of life without parole. in holding that it does not, the court returned to miller, finding, s rationale is the proposition-articulated in 6 roper, amplified in graham, and further elaborated in miller itself-that constitutionally significant differences between (id. at p. 1379.) the gutierrez evidence bearing on the distinctive attmiller. (id. at p. 1390.) 2. the tlife sentence mcguire contends, in selecting a term of 50 years to life, the trial court (1) failed to consider the relevant miller factors in sentencing mcguire as a juvenile, and (2) imposed a sentence which, at the time of sentencing, was the functional equivalent of lwop in violation of the eighth amendment. the people argue (1) the trial court considered and properly applied the miller factors in making its sentencing decision, (2) moot under section 3051.5 a. the court failed to consider all of the miller factors we agree with rial court did not follow our mandate to reconsider its sentence in light of miller and caballerocomments showed it imposed an aggregate term of 50 years to life after considering only 5 the caballero court encouraged the legislature a parole eligibility mechanism that provides a defendant serving a de facto life sentence without possibility of parole for nonhomicide crimes that he or she committed as a juvenile with the opportunity to obtain release on a showing of rehabilitation and caballero, supra, 55 cal.4th at p. 269, fn. 5.) was convicted of a controlling offense that was committed before the person had attained 18 years of age and for which the sentence is a life term of 25 years to life shall be eligible for release on parole by the board during his or her 25th year of incarceration at a youth offender parole hearing, unless previously released or entitled to an earlier parole 7 role in the offenses, size, lack of health issues, educational status, and lack of substance abuse. while the court considered the unrelated factors of health and physical size, the court mcguires age, his competency to deal with police, his home environment, and whether his history demonstrated a possibility of rehabilitation, all as required by miller.6 b. we need not determine if the sentence was lwop with granted review to determine whether a sentence of 50 years to life for a defendant convicted of a murder committed as a juvenile is the functional equivalent of an lwop sentence. (in re alatriste, review granted feb. 19, 2014, s214652, and in re bonilla, review granted feb. 19, 2014, s214960.) we need not decide this issue in this case, as the sentence imposed by the trial court, as set forth above, did not comply with the order on remand. we note, however, that the record shows mcguire was 19 years old when he was originally sentenced in 2011. we take judicial notice that the life expectancy for a black male age 19 is approximately 54 years. (national vital statistics reports, united states life tables, 2010 (nov. 6, 2014) at p. 29, available at http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr63/nvsr63_07.pdf [as of september 8, 2015].) while his earliest parole eligibility date is 2060. pending decision of the supreme court, we do not believe that this minimal 5 year potential difference removes the necessity of considering the miller factors, as the functional equivalent of lwop. 6 the court did indicate, without any elaboration, make juveniles less culpable than adults, but only in relation to its decision to make the sentences on count 2 and 3 concurrent. 8 3. section 3051 does not moot this case finally, the people argue, as they did at the trial court, that section 3051 provides the meaningful opportunity for release required in juvenile sentencing.7 the trial court relied on this provision in its sentencing decision, as set forth above. we conclude this was error. first, section 3051, by its terms, excludes individuals who are serving lwop sentences. (3051, subd. (h).) thus, if the sentence, as imposed by the trial court, remains the functional equivalent of lwop, no relief would be available to appellant. moreover, while the lwop issue remains pending, we believe the supreme elated provision provides critical guidance on this issue. based on that authority, we conclude that section 3051 does not remove the mandate to consider the hallmark features of youth at the time of sentencing. section 1170, subdivision (d)(2), for a juvenile lwop sentence, after a period of 15 years. ( 1170, subd. (d)(2)(a)(i) offense for which the defendant was sentenced to imprisonment for life without the possibility of parole has served at least 15 years of that sentence, the defendant may submit to the sentencing court a petition f in gutierrez argument that the enactment of section 1170, subdivision (d)(2) resolved the constitutional problems arising from the fact that california courts had interpreted section 190.5, subdivision (b) as creating a presumption for lwop sentences for juveniles. the gutierrez he potential for relief under section 1170(d)(2) does not eliminate the serious constitutional doubts arising from a presumption in favor of life without parole under section 190.5(b) . . . people v. gutierrez, supra, 58 cal.4th at p. 1385.) 7 the court will also decide in alatriste, supra, s214652, and bonilla, supra, s214960 whether, as the people argue, section 3051 effectively moots any claim that such a sentence amounts to cruel and unusual punishment. 9 in our view, both section 3051 and section 1170, subdivision (d)(2), fall short of what miller requires. first of all, miller makes clear the special considerations attendant to youth are to be considered at the time of sentencing. as the gutierrez court observed: miller repeatedly made clear that the sentencing authority must address this risk of error by considering how children are different and how those differences counsel against a sentence of life without parole before imposing a particular penalty. (people v. gutierrez, supra, 58 cal.4th at p. 1387, quoting miller v. alabama, supra, 567 u.s. at p. __, 132 s.ct. at p. 2471, italics added; see id. at pp. __, __, 132 s.ct. at pp. 2469, 2475.) in addition, both provisions petitioning processes15 years after sentencing in the case of section 1170, subdivision (d)(2) and 25 years in section 3051are inconsistent with the supreme court analysis in miller. allowing the deferral of constitutionally mandated sentencing factors for a minimum of a decade and a half after conviction rather than requiring consideration of those facts before incarceration effectively makes miller mandate irrelevant to our sentencing courts. nothing in miller indicates that the supreme court envisioned any such deferral of constitutionally required sentencing co that such consideration will result in the ha 4. joint and several liability for victim restitution in our earlier opinion, we noted the record showed the trial court intended to make the liability for victim restitution to be joint and several between mcguire and codefendant taylor and directed the trial court to modify the judgment accordingly. (people v. blackburn (1999) 72 cal.app.4th 1520, 1534-1535.) on remand, we again direct the trial court to do so. 5. modification of criminal conviction assessment similarly, the trial court did not correct the amount that mcguire owes under government code, section 70373 as we previously ordered. therefore on remand the 10 court must impose a $30 criminal conviction assessment for each count, for a total of $90, rather than the $40 for each count, for a total of $120, that the trial court erroneously imposed on mcguire when he was originally sentenced. disposition the judgment is reversed and the matter remanded for resentencing consistent with this opinion. zelon, acting p. j. we concur: segal, j. beckloff, j.* * judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
