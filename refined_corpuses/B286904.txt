(a)(2) [counts 1 and 2]),1 two counts of felon in possession of a firearm ( 29800, subd. (a)(1) [counts 3 and 7]), and one count of unlawful possession of ammunition ( 30305, subd. (a)(1) [count 4]).2 the jury found diaz discharged a firearm proximately causing great bodily injury ( 12022.7, subd. (a)) in count 1, and personally and intentionally used a firearm in counts 1 and 2 ( 12022.5, subds. (a), (d)). the jury found that diaz committed the crimes in counts 1, 2, and 7 for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with a criminal street gang. ( 186.22, subd. (b)(1)(c).)3 diaz admitted to serving a prior conviction for a serious felony within the meaning of section 667, subdivision (a)(1), and a 1 all further statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise indicated. 2 there are no counts 5 and 6 listed in the operative information. 3 the jury found the gang enhancements alleged in counts 3 and 4 not true. 3 serious or violent felony within the meaning of the three strikes law ( 667, subds. (b)(i), 1170.12, subds. (a)(d)). diaz was sentenced to state prison for a total of 26 years, comprised of the upper term of 4 years in count 1, which was doubled to 8 years as a second strike, plus 3 years for the great bodily injury enhancement, 10 years for the related gun use, and 5 years for the prior serious felony conviction. diaz was sentenced to the middle term of 3 years in count 2, which was doubled to 6 years as a second strike, plus an additional 4 years for the related gun use, for a total of 10 years to run concurrently with the sentence in count 1. the trial court stayed imposition of sentence on the gang enhancements in connection with counts 1 and 2.4 the trial court imposed and stayed concurrent terms of two years each in counts 3, 4, and 7 pursuant to section 654. on appeal, diaz contends: (1) the trial court erred in denying his motion to sever trial; (2) there is insufficient evidence to support the gang enhancement findings; (3) the trial court erred in permitting the prosecto rely on information obtained from police reports; (4) the prosecutor misstated evidence in closing argument; (5) the cumulative effect of the trial errors violated his due process rights; (6) remand is necessary so the trial court may exercise its discretion to strike the firearm enhancements 4 the abstract of judgment does not include the gang enhancement in count 7, which the trial court failed to address at the sentencing hearing. 4 under section 12022.5, subdivisions (a) and (d) in counts 1 and 2 pursuant to senate bill 620; and (7) remand is necessary so the trial court may exercise its discretion to strike the prior conviction enhancement under section 667, subdivision (a)(1), pursuant to senate bill 1393. the attorney general concedes the matter should be remanded to allow the trial court an opportunity to exercise its discretion to strike the firearm enhancements, but otherwise contests claims. we remand the matter to permit the trial court the option, if it so chooses, to exercise its discretion to strike diaz firearm and prior conviction enhancements within the confines of section 1385, pursuant to senate bill 620 and senate bill 1393. we strike the gang enhancements under section 186.22(b)(1)(c) for insufficient evidence. in all other respects the judgment is affirmed. facts the prosecution december 2015 shooting at approximately 10:30 a.m. on december 2, 2015, nadia a. and her two-year old daughter were in apartment when diaz unexpectedly knocked on the door. nadia and diaz shared a child but had broken up on hostile terms. street. 5 nadia eventually agreed to let diaz see their daughter outside of the apartment door. after seeing diaz and the daughter sit down, nadia continued washing dishes in her apartment. when she turned around, diaz and the child were gone. nadia ran outside but could not locate diaz or her daughter, so she demanded that friend call him. diaz returned five minutes later. following a brief altercation, diaz ran after nadia, who ran inside and tried to lock the door. diaz put their daughter down and ripped the door open. nadia ran through the apartment and exited through the bedroom door. diaz ran after nadia, threatening to hit her. nadia screamed. andrew n. and lauren t. exited their apartment after hearing nadia scream. andrew, lauren, and another individual circled around nadia and demanded that diaz leave. diaz began to argue with a group of five men who were walking down the street. diaz and the men were diaz pulled a pocket knife from his pants and swung it around. no one but diaz had a weapon. according to nadia, diaz is a member of the temple street gang with the diaz temple, templeyelled their allegiance to florencia 13. nadia yelled for diaz to leave, so he started to back up temple street. -- templediaz got into his friends car and yelled as the car sped away. 6 lauren and andrew went back to their apartment. nadia called the police. approximately 10 to 15 minutes later, lauren and andrew went back outside so andrew could smoke a cigarette. lauren, andrew, and three other individuals were outside when they saw diaz in the alley behind the apartment complex. when diaz was approximately 12 to 21 feet away from the group, he pulled out a handgun, aimed at them, and began to shoot. as the group ran away, diaz fired four shots. the first bullet went oot. diaz jammed the gun on his fifth attempt to shoot. diaz ran back into the alley and got into the same car that initially drove him . the car sped off. the recovered four .32 caliber shell casings from the scene. six days after the shooting, lauren and andrew positively identified diaz in a six-pack photographic lineup. right foot required surgical repair because the bullet shattered a bone in his toe. march 2016 search of diaz diaz was arrested at his residence on march 17, 2016. during a search of his residence, department of corrections special agent traylor recovered a loaded .22 rifle behind the front door, a loaded .32 handgun on the bed, and magazines and bullets for both caliber guns. 7 during a march 23, 2016 interview, diaz told a recovered from his residence matched the bullet casings at the scene of the december 2, 2015 shooting. the parties stipulated that the bullet casings recovered from the scene of the shooting did not match the handgun that was recovered from residence on march 17, 2016. gang evidence los angeles police department officer paul cruz testified as an expert on criminal street gangs for the prosecution. during the 12 years he worked as a peace officer, officer cruz was trained on criminal street gangs and was assigned gang enforcement detail. officer cruz was temple street gang. he drove and walked around the neighborhood the gang claims every day. temple street has been in existence since 1923 and is a members. officer cruz had personally spoken to approximately 50 to 60 of the temple street members, knew temple street, and had personally met with diaz on six or seven occasions. officer cruz based his opinion that diaz is a temple street gang member on multiple self-admissions diaz made to officer cruz personally between 2013 and 2016, dia, including those reflected in photographs. officer cruz 8 opined that diaz was an active member of temple street on december 2, 2015, and march 17, 2016. under a hypothetical scenario with facts paralleling the facts in this case, officer cruz stated he believed the crimes were committed for the benefit of the temple street gang. the defense diaz testified on his own behalf. diaz went to apartment on december 2, 2015 to see his daughter. after he picked up his daughter, diaz walked around the perimeter of the apartment complex. his friend called him during the walk so nadia could yell at him. diaz returned with his daughter and when diaz was walking outside, he saw two men. one held a crowbar in his hand, and when diaz tried to ask who they were, the other man punched him in the face. diaz fell to the ground. while he was getting up, diaz saw andrew behind him and heard a noise resembling a taser. in response, diaz pulled out a knife. diaz heard lauren say, , and when he turned around, diaz saw one of the men shooting. diaz . he did not return. diaz got his gang tattoo when he was 13 or 14 years old and was no longer an active gang member in december 2015. during his time in the gang, diaz would diaz stopped participating in gang activity. 9 he denied telling officer cruz he was a temple street gang member. discussion motion to sever prior to trial, diaz filed a motion to sever the counts associated with the search of his residence on march 17, 2016 (counts 3 and 4), from those associated with the shootings on december 2, 2015 (counts 1, 2, and 7). in his motion, diaz contended that counts 3 and 4 could not be properly tried with counts 1 and 2 because they did not meet the requirements for joinder under section 954. diaz argued the charges were (1) not in the same class of crimes or offenses, and (2) did not involve the same gun and therefore did not . diaz further contended that even if joinder was proper under section 954, due process required severance of the counts. he asserted that the facts of each incident were not cross-admissible because the incidents involved different firearms, and that joinder would impermissibly allow the prosecution to use the stronger possession of a firearm case to bootstrap the weaker shooting case. the prosecution opposed the motion, contending the offenses were of the same class of crimes, and that there was no substantial danger of prejudice from trying all counts together because the evidence was cross-admissible. 10 the trial court denied diaz legal principles different offenses connected together in their commission, or . . . two or more different offenses of the same class of crimes or offenses . . . . [t]he court in which a case is triable, in the interests of justice and for good cause shown, may in its discretion order that the different offenses or counts set forth in the accusatory pleading be tried separately or divided into two or more groups and each of said groups tried times and places against different victims are nevertheless . . linked by a tance.(people v. mendoza people v. anderson (2018) 5 cal.5th 372, 388.) properly joined under penal code section 954 is examined independently as the resolution of a pure question of law .  954)or the resolution of a predominantly legal mixed fact-law questionconnected . . .

(people v. saldana (1965) 233 cal.app.2d 24, 3031; see generally united states v. lane misjoinder would rise to the level of a constitutional violation only if it results in prejudice so great as to deny a defendant his fifth amendment right to a fair trialy probable that a result more favorable to the appealing party would have been reached in people v. watson (1956) 46 cal.2d 818, 836.) analysis we reject diazdid not meet the requirements for joinder under section 954, he has not demonstrated there is a reasonable probability that he would have obtained a more favorable result if counts 3 and 4 had not been joined with counts 1, 2, and 7.5 5 because we conclude that, even assuming the counts were improperly joined, diaz has not established there is a reasonable probability that he would have obtained a more favorable result in the absence of error, we need not proceed 12 n the counts associated with the search of the residence was so strong defense counsel then could not have found the gun that was used to shoot andrew in the search on march 17, 2016, as proof that he was not the shooter in the december 2, 2015 incident. the ein the counts associated with the shooting was also extremely strong. diaz conceded that he was present at the scene, engaged in a confrontation with the group of men, and held a knife in his hand during that confrontation. his defense rested entirely on the theory that andrew was injured by i.e. that someone in florencia 13 shot himalthough there was no evidence that either andrew or lauren knew the men in the group or had engaged in an altercation with them. diaz asserted that andrew, lauren, and nadia fabricated a story to blame him rather than the . the prosecution presented very strong evidence in support of its theory that diaz was the shooter. andrew and to the issues omotion was an abuse of discretion (people v. johnson (2015) 61 cal.4th 734, 750), or whether denial of the severance trial or due process of law [citation] (people v. bean (1988) 46 cal.3d 919, 934940). 13 lauren identified diaz as the shooter in both photographic lineups and in open court. they unequivocally testified to andrew, lauren, and nadia all testified that diaz yelled temple, templemembers of the florencia 13 gang. nadia testified that diaz said he would gang moniker. the testimony was corroborated by nadia affiliation. there was overwhelming evidence that diaz shot at the two groups of people, injuring andrew in the process, and that he acted for the benefit the temple street gang when he did so. the jury was thoroughly instructed regarding the factors it was permitted to consider and the ways in which it could evaluate witness credibility under caljic nos. 2.20, 2.21.1, and 2.21.2. clearly, it found the eyewitnesses credible of the events. we presume that jurors are intelligent and capable of understanding and following the coinstructions (people v. lewis (2001) 26 cal.4th 334, 390), and we have no reason to believe that the jury did not do so here. finally, the jury was instructed that diaz was presumed innocent, that the prosecution had the burden to establish his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt (caljic nos. 2.90 and 2.91), and that it must decide each count separately (caljic no. 17.02). tenhancements charged in connection with s possession 14 of a firearm and ammunition on march 17, 2016 were not true, despite its true findings on the gang allegations in counts 1, 2, and 7, further bolsters the conclusion that the jurors considered the counts separately and were not influenced by joinder of the charges. because he has not establishe gang enhancements true findings on the gang enhancements in counts 1, 2, and 7. we agree that the evidence was insufficient to establish the temple strike the gang enhancements in those counts. we find no merit in the remaining contentions relating to the gang findings, but we address the issues because diaz contends that he was prejudiced by cumulative error. proceedings to prove the gang enhancements alleged in counts 1, 2, and 7, the prosecution examined officer cruz, who had driven, walked, and conducted foot beats in temple street territory daily, and had personally spoken to between 50 and 60 active temple street gang members. officer cruz personally investigated crimes committed by temple street 15 robberies, attempt[ed] murders, assault with a deadly weapon, [and] possession of handguns. officer cruz was questioned regarding a certified minute order reflecting that amir ahmadi was convicted of criminal threats in connection with an incident that took place on october 5, 2015. officer cruz was familiar with the incident through the police reports and speaking with investigating officers, and knew ahmadi personally. in ahmadi was a member of temple street when he committed the crime. officer cruz was also questioned regarding a certified minute order reflecting that gabriel de los reyes was convicted of a robbery that occurred on january 2, 2013. officer cruz knew de los reyes personally, but became familiar with the crime through reading the crime reports and speaking with arresting officers. officer cruz opined that de los reyes was a member of temple street gang when he committed the robbery. defense counsel objected regarding ahmadi and de los reyes under people v. sanchez (2016) 63 cal.4th 665. outside the presence of the jury, counsel argued that the prosecution would have to bring in the reporting officers if officer cruz was cruz testified that he personally spoke with the investigating officers and learned the facts surrounding the convictions based on the conversations. the people argued 16 that the conversations negated any issue with sanchez. the court agreed and overruled the objection. analysis sufficiency of the evidence diaz first contends enhancements should be stricken because the evidence was insufficient to prove the existence of a criminal street gang. he argues that the gang expert did not quantify the number of enumerated crimes used to establish activities, and lacked personal knowledge of predicate crimes 6 we agree that the prosecution did not introduce sufficient evidence of , and strike the gang enhancements. evidence to support a conviction we apply the substantial 6 in his opening brief, diaz asserts that to the extent testimony by officer cruz forfeits those claims on appeal, counsel provided ineffective assistance. with respect to his object does not forfeit the issue, so we need not address that claim. (people v. trujillo (2010) 181 cal.app.4th 1344, 1350, fn. 3 [sufficiency of the evidence claims may be raised at any time].) 17 evidence standard. under that standard the reviewing court examines the entire record to determine whether or not there is substantial evidence from which a reasonable jury could find beyond a reasonable doubt that the crime has been committed. in reviewing that evidence the appellate court does not make credibility determinations and draws all reasonable inferences in favor of the we do not weigh the evidence but rather ask whether there is sufficient reasonable credible evidence of solid value that would support the conviction. (people v. johnson (1980) 26 cal.3d 557, 576people v. russell (2010) 187 cal.app.4th 981, 987988.) and questions of credibility are resolved in favor of the people v. lara (2017) 9 cal.app.5th 296, 314 (lara).) under section 186.22, subdivision (b)(1), a criminal defendant is subject to additional punishment for a felony or attempted felony when the offense benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with any criminal street gang, with the specific intent to promote, further, or assist in any crimina( 186.22, subd.

(gardeley, supra, 14 cal.4th at p. 620.) in vy, supra, 122 cal.app.4th at page 1219, the expert testified that assaults, assaults with a deadly weapon, and attempted murder were primary activities of 21 the gang. in durancommitting assaults with a deadly weapon and narcotics sales sufficient to control sales in the community.

[] so this is an essential element of the criminal ] analysis upon the ground of ineffective assistance of counsel under either the state or federal constitution, a defendant must establish (1) that defense performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness, i.e., that performance did not meet the standard to be expected of a reasonably competent attorney, and (2) that there is a reasonable probability that defendant would have obtained a more favorable result absent people v. cunningham (2001) 25 cal.4th 926, 1003 (cunningham), citing strickland v. washington (1984) 466 u.s. 668, 687694 (stricklandbability is a probability (strickland[, supra,] at p. 694; people v. riel (2000) 22 cunningham, supra, at p. 1003.) prosecutoegregious that it infects the trial with such unfairness as to 31 make the conviction a denial of dconduct by a prosecutor that does not render a criminal trial fundamentally unfair is prosecutorial misconduct under reprehensible methods to attempt to persuade either the . . . additionally, when the claim focuses upon comments made by the prosecutor before the jury, the question is whether there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury construed or applied any of the complained-of rpeople v. samayoa (1997) 15 cal.4th 795, 841; accord, people v. hill (1998) 17 cal.4th 800, 819 (hill).) prosecutors may not misstate the evidence. (people v. davis (2005) 36 cal.4th 510, 550.) they are, however, given wide latitude during argument, and may be vigorous as long as it amounts to fair comment on the evidence, which can include reasonable inferences or deductions to be drawn therefrom. (people v. hamilton (2009) 45 cal.4th 863, 928; hill, supra, 17 cal.4th at p. 819.) a prosecutor has -ranging right to discuss the case in closing argument[, including] the right to fully state his views as to what the evidence shows and to urge whatever conclusions he deems people v. panah (2005) 35 cal.4th 395, 463 [prosecutor did not commit misconduct by pointing out his view of the evidence overcame the beyond reasonable doubt presumption].) here, there is no reasonable probability that diaz would have obtained a more favorable outcome if his 32 the record does not demonstrate that the prosecutor misstated the evidence. rather, the prosecutor permissibly stated her views regarding what the evidence showedthat and de los reys, together with the current charges against diaz, established the primary activities element under the gang enhancement statute. (see sengpadychith, supra, 26 cal.4th at p. 323 [prior criminal activities and current charges may be used to establish primary activities element in section 186.22].) although we conclude that this evidence falls short of the substantial evidence necessary to sustain the gang enhancements, the the record was proper. basis for ineffective assistance. (people v. coffman and marlow (2004) 34 cal.4th 1, 118.) cumulative error diaz contends that even if no single error warrants reversal, the cumulative effect of the errors at trial mandates reversal. we disagree.

(a), (d)), and the five-year prior serious felony conviction enhancement ( 667, subdivision (a)(1)). the trial court is directed to forward a certified copy of the amended abstract of judgment to the department of corrections. in all other respects, the judgment is affirmed. moor, j. we concur: baker, acting p.j. jaskol, j. judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
