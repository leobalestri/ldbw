and a white see-through cover-up. negri observed defendant making hand movements with his cell phone, and could see that defendant had taken a picture of the girls buttocks. on june 18, 2013, negri

bath department near several mothers with small children. defendant was holding his cell phone near his waist and he appeared to be taking photographs of them. defendant went to the self-checkout register where there were two girls and took photographs of them. defendant then went to the starbucks and stood behind a mother who had three children with her (two boys and a girl), and took photographs of them. using the information from the license plate on defendants car, detective mike marino of the los angeles county sheriffs department contacted defendant at his residence. defendant told detective marino that he was a convicted child molester and was a sexual registrant. when detective marino confronted defendant with the incident at target, defendant admitted following the girls

sentenced defendant to the upper term of six years, doubled pursuant to the three strikes law, sections 667, subdivisions (b) through (i) and 1170.12, subdivisions (a) through (e). the record

(people v. whitaker (2015) 238 cal.app.4th 1354, 1356.) under that section, defendant is entitled to 421 days of actual credit and 420 days of conduct credit, for a total of 841 days. 3 we appointed counsel to represent defendant on appeal. after examination of the to independently review the record. on june 22, 2015, we notified defendant that he had 30 days within which to personally submit any grounds of appeal contentions or argument 30-day extension to file a supplemental brief. on august 18, 2015, we denied defend-day extension of time to file a supplemental brief. 5 disposition of custody credit and to impose in its place an award of 841 days, consisting of 421 days of actual custody credit and 420 days of conduct credit. the superior court is directed to prepare a minute order reflecting this change, and to send an amended abstract of judgment to the department of corrections and rehabilitation reflecting such modification. as modified, the judgment of the superior court is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports kirschner, j.* we concur: mosk, acting p.j. kriegler, j. * judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
