[] the court reviewed said motion and ruled as follows: denied. the same motion had previously been submitted by the defendant, on march 17, 2009 and ruled upon by judge coen. judge coen denied the request. this court agrees (bold in original.) on august 21, 2013, chaparro order. contentions after examination of the record, appointed appellate counsel filed an opening brief which raised no issues and requested this court to conduct an independent review of the record. by notice filed december 13, 2013, the clerk of this court advised chaparro to submit within 30 days any contentions, grounds of appeal or arguments he wished this court to consider. after this court granted chaparro an extension of time within which to file it, chaparro filed a supplemental letter brief on february 18, 2014. in his brief, chaparro contends the trial court erred by imposing the $10,000 restitution fine without considering his ability to pay the fine. he asserts, due to his security level within the 4 prison, he is ineligible for any of the available jobs. in addition, chaparro is no direct victim to receive the restitution firequests this court to direct the trial court to reduce the fine to $280. restitution fines are governed by section 1202.4, subdivision (b). although the statute has been amended a number of times since chaparro committed the murder of ayala, people v. blackburn (1999) 72 cal.app.4th 1520, 1533.) in 1999, as it does presently, section 1202.4, subdivision (b) provided: person is convicted of a crime, the court shall impose a separate and additional restitution fine, unless it finds compelling and extraordinary reasons for not doing so, and states former subdivision (b)at the discretion of the court and commensurate with the seriousness of the offense, but shall not be less than two hundred dollars ($200), and not more than ten thousand dollars ($10,000), if the person is the only relevant differences between the former subdivision and the present subdivision (b)(1) is that the present subdivision provides, and, former subdivision (c), as does the present subdivision (c), provided in relevant part that [a] inability to pay shall not be considered a compelling and extraordinary reason not to impose a restitution fine. inability to pay may be considered only in finally, both the former and present versions of subdivision (d) indicate that, should the trial court set the amount of the fine pursuant to subdivision (b) in excess of the minimum, it shall consider any relevant factors, pay, the seriousness and gravity of the offense and the circumstances here, chaparro was found guilty of the most heinous of crimes, a first degree, special circumstances murder. he committed the offense during a kidnapping and killed his victim, after she had begged him to take her to a hospital, by personally firing a rifle at her chest and head. a in view of the 5 circumstances of the crime, imposition of the $10,000 fine was appropriate. (see people v. lewis (2009) 46 cal.4th 1255, 1321; people v. defrance (2008) 167 cal.app.4th 486, 504-505; see also people v. kramis (2012) 209 cal.app.4th 346, 351.) there is no victim to receive the restitution fine, we note a fine imposed pursuant to section 1202.4, subdivision (b) is not intended to compensate the victim. people v. kramis, supra, 209 cal.app.4th at pp. 349-350, citing people v. arata (2004) 118 cal.app.4th 195, 202; people v. chambers (1998) 65 cal.app.4th 819, 822.) review on appeal we have examined the entire record and are satisfied counsel has complied fully smith v. robbins (2000) 528 u.s. 259, 278-284; people v. wende (1979) 25 cal.3d 436, 443.) disposition not to be published in the official reports aldrich, j. we concur: klein, p. j. kitching, j.
