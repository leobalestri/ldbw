(people v. pledger (dec. 19, 2000, b135661) [nonpub. opn.] (pledger i).) the police responded and detained pledger several blocks from the liquor store. pledger had ammunition in his pants pocket. the police found a loaded revolver in a trash can located and the location where he was detained. the bullets found in loaded in the revolver. (pledger i, supra, b135661.) b. jury verdict and sentencing a jury convicted pledger of possession of a firearm by a felon (former  12021, subd. (a)(1), now  29800, subd. (a)(1)). the jury found true the allegation pledger suffered three prior serious or violent felony convictions within the meaning of the three strikes law ( 667, subds. (b)-(i), 1170.12). (pledger i, supra, b135661.) the three prior convictions included two convictions for assault with a firearm ( 245, subd. (a)(2)) and one conviction for robbery ( 211). the court sentenced pledger to 26 years to life, including 25 years to life for possession of a firearm by a felon, calculated as a third strike under the three strikes 4 law, plus one year for a prior prison term within the meaning of section 667.5, subdivision (b). (pledger i, supra, b135661.) c. on february 13, 2013 pledger filed a petition for recall of sentence under proposition 36. he argued that possession of a firearm by a felon is no longer a serious or violent felony within the meaning of the three strikes law ( 667, subd. (d)(1), 1170.12, subd. (b)(1)), and that none of his prior serious or violent felony convictions disqualified him from having his sentence recalled ( 1170.126, subd. (e)(3); see  667, subd. (e)(2)(c)(iv), 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(c)(iv)). the superior court issued an order to show cause why his sentence should not be recalled. the people filed an opposition to the petition, asserting pledger was ineligible for resentencing under section 1170.126, current offense, the defendant . . . was armed with a firearm or deadly weapon . . .  667, subd. (e)(2)(c)(iii), 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(c)(iii).) the people also argued that pledger was unsuitable for resentencing given the nature of his prior offenses. in his reply, pledger asserted that his possession of a firearm, absent a facilitative nexus to a separate offense, did not render him ineligible for resentencing. resentencing on january 9, 2017. the superior court relied on e superior court found by a preponderance of the evidence that pledger was statutorily ineligible for recall and resentencing because he was armed with a firearm during the commission of the offense. 5 discussion a. the three strikes reform act of 2012 (proposition 36) prior to approval of proposition 36, the three strikes law provided that defendants who committed a felony and had two or more prior convictions for serious or violent felonies were to be sentenced to an indeterminate term of life imprisonment with a minimum term of at least 25 years. (former  1170.12, subds. (b), (c)(2)(a); people v. perez (2018) 4 cal.5th 1055, 1061-1062 (perez); people v. estrada (2017) 3 cal.5th 661, 666-667 (estrada).) following enactment of proposition 36, defendants are now subject to a lesser sentence when they have two or more prior strikes and are convicted of a felony that is neither serious nor violent, unless an exception applies.estrada, supra, 3 cal.5th at p. 667.) a defendant falls within one of the exceptions the defendant used a firearm, was armed with a firearm or deadly weapon, or intended to cause great bodily injury to  667, subd. (e)(2)(c)(iii), 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(c)(iii).) proposition 36 applies both prospectively and retroactively to defendants who were previously sentenced under the three strikes law. (estrada, supra, 3 cal.5th at p. for those sentenced under the scheme previously in force, [proposition 36] establishes procedures for convicted individuals to seek resentencing in accordance with the new sentencing rules. ( 1170.126.) the procedures call for two determinations. first, an inmate must be eligible for resentencing. ( 1170.126, subd. 6 (e)(2).) an inmate is eligible for resentencing if his or her current sentence was not imposed for a violent or serious felony and was not imposed for any of the offenses described in clauses (i) to (iv) of section 1170.12, subdivision (c)(2)(c). ( 1170.126, subd. (e)(2).) those clauses describe certain kinds of criminal conduct, including the use of a firearm during the commission of the (estrada, at p. 667.) because the supreme court has issued three opinions relating to a finding of ineligibility for resentencing under proposition 36 based on the defendant having been armed with a firearm or deadly weapon during the commission of the current offense, we invited the parties to submit supplemental briefing perez, estrada, and people v. frierson (2017) 4 cal.5th 225, 230, 236 (frierson).2 we address these decisions below. b. the exception to eligibility for resentencing under proposition 36 for a defendant armed with a firearm during commission of an offense applies to a conviction of possession of a firearm by a felon where the defendant has the firearm available for use, either offensively or defensively a defendant is ineligible for commission of the current offense, the defendant . . . was armed with a firearm or deadly weapon . . .  667, subd.

(people v. watson (1956) 46 cal.2d 818, 836; see people v. johnson (2016) 1 cal.app.5th 953, 968 [applying watson eligibility for resentencing under prop. 47]; cf. frierson, supra, 4 cal.5th at p. 240 [reversing the judgment and remanding to the recall of sentence under the correct standard of proof].) pledger does not dispute that he had a loaded handgun in his pocket when he was in the liquor store. thus, pledger was armed with a firearm during the commission of the crime because 12 bland, supra, 10 cal.4th at p. 997; accord, cruz, supra, 15 cal.app.5th at pp. 1109-1110.) we conclude on these undisputed facts there is no reasonable probability of a different result had the trial court applied the stricter beyond a reasonable doubt standard of proof.
