filed 2/22/19 p. v. rodriguez ca2/1 not to be published in the official reports california rules of court, rule 8.1115(a), prohibits courts and parties from citing or relying on opinions not certified for publication or ordered published, except as specified by rule 8.1115(b). this opinion has not been certified for publication or ordered published for purposes of rule 8.1115. in the court of appeal of the state of california second appellate district division one the people, plaintiff and respondent, v. jorge luis rodriguez, defendant and appellant. b288312 (los angeles county super. ct. no. na102101) appeal from a judgment of the superior court of los angeles county, jesse i. rodriguez, judge. affirmed with directions. alex coolman, under appointment by the court of appeal, for defendant and appellant. xavier becerra, attorney general, gerald a. engler, chief assistant attorney general, lance e. winters, assistant attorney general, jonathan j. kline and david w. williams, deputy attorneys general, for plaintiff and respondent. ____________________________ 2 a jury convicted defendant and appellant jorge rodriguez (rodriguez)1 of first degree murder (pen. code,2  187), and found true the allegation that rodriguez personally and intentionally discharged a firearm causing death. ( 12022.53, subd. (d).) the trial court sentenced rodriguez to a total term of 50 years to life in state prison. on appeal, rodriguez contends the trial court erred by: (1) failing to make an adequate inquiry into prospective juror bias or prejudice; (2) admitting statements rodriguez made to undercover agents while in jail; and (3) failing to instruct the jury on heat of passion voluntary manslaughter. rodriguez further contends these errors accumulated so as to deprive him of his right to a fair trial. we conclude that prospective jurors was adequate under the circumstances, that rodriguez waived his challenges to the admission of jailhouse statements by failing to litigate the issues in the trial court, and that no prejudicial error resulted from the omission of the heat of passion instructionthereby leaving no errors to accumulate. rodriguez asks us to strike from the abstract of judgment the imposition of 10 percent interest on the stipulated amount of victim restitution because the trial court did not mention interest in orally pronouncing sentence. we decline to do so because interest on victim restitution is mandatory, and a sentence excluding interest on victim restitution would be unauthorized. we thus modify the 1 it is unclear from the trial record whether legal jorge luis rodriguez cruz.consistent with the final abstract of judgmentand docketwe will use rodriguez as the surname. 2 undesignated statutory citations are to the penal code. 3 judgment to include 10 percent interest on the amount of victim restitution. we further exercise our corrective authority to strike 140 days of conduct credit prohibited by law. we affirm the judgment as modified. facts and proceedings below a. prosecution evidence 1. the shooting on june 22, 2015, around 8:45 a.m., rodriguez was standing in an alleyway in long beach, talking with dominique alvarez3 and a.p., who lived nearby. rodriguez had been out the night before, partying and drinking, and was still somewhat intoxicated. while rodriguez and the women were standing in the alley, douglas wilson (wilson) stepped out of his nearby apartment building. as wilson walked past the entrance to the alley, look at this fool thinking he is all hard, voice loud enough for wilson to hear the remark. what fool? what did you say? he added, of this bullshit. he gestured as though he wanted to fight rodriguez, and said, come on. the women tried to diffuse the situation, with alvarez him . . . a.p. tried to restrain wilson. rodriguez put his hand on his belt, indicating that he had a gun, and smirked. 3 alvarez was deceased at the time of trial. her preliminary hearing testimony, provided under a grant of immunity, was read into the record at trial. 4 one. 4 wilson then stepped back and took off his shirt to show rodriguez pulled out his gun and wilson stepped back. rodriguez shot wilson twice: once in the stomach, and once in the chest. while wilson was on the ground, rodriguez shot him two more times, including one shot in the back. rodriguez, a.p., and alvarez fled. a nurse happened by a few minutes later and found wilson still breathing. she called 911 and tried to help wilson until paramedics could arrive, eventually performing cpr before wilson died. 2. witness 911 calls several witnesses called 911 to report the shooting. jose o. had been walking his dog past the other end of the alley, about 170 feet away, while maria g. was looking out of her apartment window less than 25 feet away. jose o. saw a black man taking off his shirt and gesturing with his hands as if he wanted to fight. one of the women was jose o. could see that rodriguez was holding something. rodriguez pushed one of the women away so hard that she fell back towards a trash bin, and then fired two shots at wilson from about four feet away. wilson grabbed his stomach and said, h rodriguez shot him twice more, with his arm lowered at a 45-degree angle as he fired. 4 though alvarez testified to hearing this statement, in her initial statement to police she only reported hearing the first clause but not the second. a.p. testified at trial 5 maria g. heard people arguing and looked out the window to three people were speaking in a loud tone to the man, but she could not understand their words because she does not speak english. she then saw rodriguez take out a gun and shoot the man. the entire altercation took just seconds. 3. autopsy report an autopsy performed on wilson revealed four gunshot wounds: one in the central chest, one in the abdomen, one in the lower left back, and one on the top of the right inner arm. the range of all four shots was indeterminate, as none of the wounds showed the sort of stippling or soot associated a range of under three feet. 4. arrest of rodriguez about five weeks after the shooting, long beach police effectuated a traffic stop of a car in which rodriguez was a passenger. when the officer approached, rodriguez jumped out of the car and ran away. after speaking with the driver, the officer learned rodriguez was a murder suspect and called for backup. police established a perimeter around the area and located rodriguez in an apartment complex. after refusing to surrender, rodriguez was shot with a rubber bullet and taken into custody. rodriguez was taken to a hospital, cleared for release, and then transported to a city jail. 5. recorded jailhouse conversation the day after his arrest, rodriguez was placed in a holding cell with two confidential informants. an edited recording of 6 rodriguez stated that the person who died was black, stated rodriguez admitted he shot the victim , . . . got out and walked away a regarding the investigation into the shooting, rodriguez [t] shit. [] . . . [] detective oscar valenzuela, who helped coordinate the recorded jail cell conversation, testified that he had reviewed two police reports in which rodriguez had previously reported being victimized. on one occasion, rodriguez had been shot at, and on another occasion a person had pointed a gun at him.5 6. gang evidence6 dominique alvarez testified that her boyfriend, frank velasquez, is a member of the barrio pobre gang, and that 5 both reports were filed in 2007 and were briefly referenced during the gang-related testimony; there was no indication or testimony that these reports involved the victim in the instant shooting. the reports were again referenced in relation to defense t such experiences could result in trauma and a state of hypervigilance during future encounters. 6 though the jury found the gang allegation not true, the parties include a brief synopsis of the gang evidence. we include it here to the extent any of the gang testimony may have intersected -defense claim. 7 she believed rodriguez was also a member of that gang, who went police testified that rodriguez is a member of barrio pobre. in statements made in custody, rodriguez stated that he was barrio pobre does not get along with black gangs. wilson, however, was not a gang member. b. defense evidence a.p. testified rodriguez seemed drunk before the shooting.7 she agreed rodriguez called out to wilson, wilson confronted rodriguez, and rodriguez then shot wilson. after the shooting know what the hell to do and . . . she thought that wilson was more muscular than rodriguez. a.p. had never heard rodriguez make african- martin flores testified as a defense gang expert. he stated that newly incarcerated individuals sometimes try to boast and make themselves seem more dangerous than they really are. dr. kevin booker, a clinical psychologist with expertise in trauma, testified that experiences of past trauma can increase vigilance and make a person more susceptible to engage in fight-or-flight reactions. c. rebuttal evidence in a recorded jailhouse conversation between a.p. and rodriguez, which took place during trial, a.p. told rodriguez that . . . . 7 a.p. had multiple moral turpitude convictions. 8 d. charges and jury verdict rodriguez was charged with first degree murder ( 187), with allegations that the crime was committed for the benefit of a criminal street gang ( 186.22, subd. (b)(1)(c)), and that rodriguez personally discharged a firearm causing death ( 12022.53, subd. (d)). the jury convicted rodriguez of first degree murder and found true the firearm-use allegation; the jury found the gang allegation not true. the trial court sentenced rodriguez to a total term of 50 years to life in state prison: 25 years to life for the murder, plus 25 years to life for the firearm enhancement. discussion i. juror bias or prejudice rodriguez contends the trial court failed to conduct an prospective juror. this, according to rodriguez, resulted in a presumption of prejudice which was not dispelled. we disagree. a. relevant facts on the third day of jury selection, prospective juror no. 18 asked to speak privately with the court. once outside the presence of the jusitting] on the side of me said it is prospective juror no. 18 mother came into the courtroom after lunch and sat beside him. 9 she initially said nothing, but shortly before the court called the next group of jurors, which included prospective juror no. 18, she also, at one the court then proceeded to inquirwas seated, and whether other prospective jurors might have heard her statements. prospective juror no. 18 responded that the seat on the gentleman sitting on the other side of that seat. he further stated there were people sitting behind them, and remembered someone sitting in front of him, but not i the court asked about the volume of her voice, and prospective juror no. 18 responded that she -talkwhispering to up and mumbled something, and quickly left. he did not speak to ] defense counsel and the prosecutor also asked follow-up questions. when asked whether he heard anyone else react to the no. later, when wilsoand left the courtroom, the gentleman on the other side of the another prospective jurorwho was jokingly providing play-by-play commentssaid 10 it . . . prospective juror no. 18 did not smother talk to anyone other than himself. the prosecutor and defense counsel stipulated that prospective juror no. 18 should be excused, and defense counsel asked for a mistrial. defense counsel stated it was unclear whether the court deferred ruling on the motion and made the following inquiry of all prospective jurors as a group: have any of you been approached by someone, a female, and has that person spoken to you or made any comments to you, about this case, whether you were inside of the courtroom or outside? if someone has approached you and talked to you about this case, please raise your hands. no hands in the box. no hands of any ladies and gentlemen in the audience. the court then asked the following: have any of you heard any comments about this case, any reference to anyone involved in this case, any reference to the prosecution part of the case, to the defense part of the case? any person, whether talking about a witness, the defendant, the victim, anyone? anything that you have heard, even if not directed at you, by someone else other than [defense counsel], [the prosecutor] or the court? apply. if there [are] any comments, anything that you heard from anyone other than the three of us here about this case regarding any of the parties, anything about this case, anything? if you have today or yesterday or the day before yesterdayif you have in the last day or so, today, raise your hands, ladies and 11 gentlemen in the audience and anybody in the audiencei mean in the box or the audience. no hands. the court then admonished the pool that reporting such statements was vital: if someone talks to you or attempts to talk to you about this case, you must end the encounter, and you must notify the bailiff immediately, immediately. it is very important. it is critical. [] . . . [] anyone have second thoughts about what i asked? anything that comes to mind? if it does, raise your hands. no hands of the ladies and gentleman in the box nor in the audience. and i am convinced that we have all of the jurors here. at sidebar, defense counsel expressed concern that been the court disagreed. defense counsel then stated that it was known, through prospective juror no. 18, that the gentleman two seats over from but indicating the prosecutor commented that, based on prospective juror no. something prior to leaving which prompted the gentleman to say indicating what she said. the court denied the motion for mistrial. 12 after further voir dire, defense counsel exercised three peremptory challenges, and then accepted the panel with 11 out of 20 peremptory challenges remaining. b. governing legal principles in carrying out its duty to select a fair and impartial jury, the trial court must conduct an inquiry sufficient to ascertain whether capable of participating in their assigned function in such fashion as will provide the defendant the fair trial to which he is constitutionally entitled. people v. martinez (1991) 228 cal.app.3d 1456, 1463 (martinez).) thwhether or not possible bias or prejudice against the defendant has people v. medina (1990) 51 cal.3d 870, 889 (medina)n of (martinez, supra, 228 cal.app.3d at pp. 14661467.) accordingly, determinations of either individual or group owing of martinez, supra, 228 cal.app.3d at pp. 14661467.) c. discussion as respondent correctly observes, because no jury had been (see people v. silva (2001) 25 cal.4th 345, 372373; people v. mayfield (1997) 14 cal.4th 668, 722, fn. 7 (mayfield)entire jury panel8 on the grounds they were likely tainted by 8 13 (code civ. proc.,  225 [defining classes and types of challenges to people v. gutierrez (2009) 45 cal.4th 789, 805806 (gutierrez) [applying code of civil procedure section 225 to prospective juror juries in civil however, assuming motion as one to quash or dismiss the panel, denial of the motion was well within its discretion.9 first, the prospective juror who heard the inflammatory sed from jury service.

(people v. perez (2018) 4 cal.5th 421, 445 [failure to exhaust peremptory challenges or express dissatisfaction with final composition of jury, precludes appellate review of failure to excuse prospective juror[s].)11 at bottom, series of speculative assumptions supplemented by his assertion that once prospective juror no. 18 reported the incident of the entire jury panel. even if some type of presumptive prejudice arose at the initial disclosure stage, it was readily dispelled here.

(id. at p. 835.) when asked if that juror had to a point, [s]he mentioned a couple of names. ibid.) the court spoke to the identified juror but refused to inquire into the nature of the information, instead focusing on whether she could remain impartial. (idfailure to ask about the nature of the information prevented an inquiry sufficient to determine if discharge for cause was required. (id. at p. 840.) here, the facts regarding the improper contact were squarely before the trial court, and the affected [prospective] juror was discharged before trial. 13 in illinois v. perkins (1990) 496 u.s. 292, 297 (perkins), the united states supreme court held that a conversation between 17 he did not challenge the perkins operation itself, but identified 28 areas of the transcript for exclusion on the basis of hearsay, relevance, and undue prejudice.14 during argument, in between discussing evidentiary objections to two specific sentences, defense counsel stated: [defense counsel]: just for the record, i am making a record that i am objecting on relevance grounds and objecting to hearsay grounds and also objecting on fifth amendment grounds and sixth amendment grounds. [] . . . [] and the reason why i am arguing fifth amendment violation is because the detectives arrested my client. they prepared this operation. it took hours. they went and got two informants, put recording devices on them. they held my client separate then put an incarcerated suspect and an undercover agent posing as a fellow inmate did not implicate the concerns underlying miranda v. arizona (1966) 384 u.s. 436 (miranda). the supreme csuspect does not know that he is convcoercive pressures underlying the miranda (perkins, supra, 496 u.s. at p. 297; see also people v. williams (1988) 44 cal.3d 1127, 11411142 [stating miranda applied to conversations between an inmate and an undercover 14 at the outset of the motion, rodriguez listed a series of evidence c[v]iolation of fundamental due process to a fair trial, and 6th amendment right in the body of the motion, rodriguez included references to due process and the sixth amendment as taglines to challenges directed at specific statements in the transcript. 18 him in there without reading miranda rights and then started interrogating by approximately the court: absolutely positivelyyou know, [defense counsel], and i know and everybody else knows miranda is not applicable whatsoever here, period. there is a litany of federal cases, state cases. it is a done deal.

[] [defense counsel]: can the court state the grounds for the denial to make a clean record when it goes up on appeal they know what the court considers? the court: well, first of all, it is a perkins violation [sic]. the law allows us tothe supreme court, federal and state, and all the appellate courts have said that on a perkins operation all of your objections have been made and overruled. mirandaviolation or anything like that. i mean, it is all over the place, period. so your objections are overruled.(italics added.) was played for the jury, and a 41-page transcript was introduced as exhibit 20-a. b. governing legal principles [t]he failure to object to errors committed at trial relieves the reviewing court of the obligation to consider those errors on appeal. people v. kennedy (2005) 36 cal.4th 595, 612 (kennedy), 19 disapproved on other grounds in people v. williams (2010) 49 cal.4th 405, 458459; see also in re seaton (2004) 34 cal.4th the kennedy, supra, 36 cal.4th at p. te courts review of the trial courts admission of evidence is then limited to the stated ibid; evid. code,  353.) an opportunity to address the objection, and it prevents a party from engaging in gamesmanship by choosing not to object, awaiting kennedy, supra, 36 cal.4th at p. 612.) c. the claims are forfeited on appeal, rodriguez contends the admission of statements from the perkins operation violated his due process rights. in so contending, rodriguez argues that: (1) the statements should be deemed to fall outside a standard perkins operation, citing language from the concurring opinion in perkins; (2) the statements were coerced and involuntary, citing extensive facts from an unredacted transcript;15 and (3) the perkins operation conducted in his case 15 (oregon v. elstad (1985) 470 u.s. 298, 310311 (oregon)), (dickerson v. united states (2000) 530 u.s. 428, 444 (dickerson), is separate and distinct from a claim that the admission of statements violated the miranda rule. (oregon, at p. 310; dickerson, at p. 444; ariz. v. fulminante (1991) 499 u.s. 279, 285286, 287, fn. 3 [examining totality of circumstances to determine whether confession was actually coerced and noting court coerced confession involuntary confession ].) 20 close to the rack and screw government conduct in violation of his substantive due process rights. to support his arguments, rodriguez asks us to augment the record on appeal to include an unredacted 189-page transcript of the jailhouse conversation that was never made part of the record below. his legal challenges forfeited. as noted ante, footnote 14shows the fifth and sixth amendment claims were part and parcel of his specific evidentiary challenges. (cf. people v. partida (2005) 37 cal.4th 428, 439 [explaining that section 352 probative-vs.-prejudice analysis is subsumed within claim that admission of prejudicial evidence had the additional legal consequence of violating due process]; cf. people v. albarran (2007) 149 cal.app.4th 214, 229230 & fn. 13 [admission of evidence violates due process if no permissible inference may be drawn from it].) to the extent trial counsel orally challenged the perkins statements by pointing out rodriguez was miranda mean counsel was making a fifth amendment miranda challenge that was meritless under established authority. (cf. people v. scott (1978) 21 cal.3d 284, 290 [objection will be deemed adequately preserved if, despite inadequate phrasing, record shows court understood the issue presented].) on appeal, rodriguez asserts that his statements during the jailhouse conversation were coerced and involuntary because he was exhausted from lack of sleep and in pain from having been previously shot with a rubber bullet. 21 the fact that trial counsel thereafter insisted he was not mirandaclarified nothing, while his subsequent would like him to address, only highlights why the forfeiture rule should apply here. to identify arguable issues ract facts from the record that arguments to provide a better chance at success. it is also inappropriate for counsel to toss out umbrella phrases such as and then demand the trial court . (see, generally, kennedy, supra, 36 cal.4th at p. 612.) appellate counsel cites numerous legal doctrines while requesting this court to review a transcript which was never admitted in the trial court, but instead redacted to a fraction of its size through item-by-item litigation and concessions among the parties. on appeal, this court is limited to the four corners of the [underlying] record. (people v. waidla (2000) 22 cal.4th 690, 703, fn. 1 (waidla).) accordingly, the claims directed at the statements admitted during the perkins operation are deemed forfeited. (kennedy, supra, 36 cal.4th at pp. 611612 [failure to object on a coercion theory forfeited claim that coerced testimony was erroneously admitted]; cf. people v. debouver (2016) 1 cal.app.5th 972, 977978 [defendant, who argued only in trial court he was too intoxicated to voluntarily waive miranda, forfeited argument statements were the product of police coercion].) 22 the motion to augment the appellate record with the unredacted transcript is, likewise, denied. (see cal. rules of court, rule 8.155(a); people v. bais (1973) 31 cal.app.3d 663, 673674 [matters not made part of record in trial court may not be considered, for any purpose, on appeal]; people v. brooks (1980) 26 cal.3d 471, 484 [same]; muller v. robinson (1961) 193 cal.app.2d 835, 836837 [same].) iii. heat of passion voluntary manslaughter instruction towards the end of trial, the trial court discussed jury instructions and applicable defenses with the parties. the court subsequently instructed the jury on the elements of murder, self-defense, imperfect self-defense, and voluntary intoxication. the court did not instruct the jury as to heat of passion manslaughter, nor did defense counsel request such an instruction. a. relevant law and standard of review a trial court must instruct on lesser included offenses whenever substantial evidence raises a question as to whether all elements of the charged offense are present. (people v. avila (2009) 46 cal.4th 680, 705 (avila).) where an intentional and unlawful killing occurs upon a sudden quarrel or heat of passion ( 192, subd. (a)), the malice aforethought required for murder is negated, and the offense is reduced to voluntary manslaughtera lesser included offense of murder. (people v. carasi (2008) 44 cal.4th 1263, 1306.) for the instructional duty to arise, there must be substantial evidence which, if accepted . . . [citation], would absolve [the] defendant from guilt of the greater offense but not the lesser. (waidla, supra, 22 cal.4th at p. 733, italics omitted.) the substantial evidence requirement is not satisfied by any 23 evidence . . . no matter how weak. (avila, supra, 46 cal.4th at p. 705.) a heat of passion theory . . . has both an objective and a subjective component. (people v. moye (2009) 47 cal.4th 537, 549 (moye).) to satisfy the subjective element of this form of voluntary manslaughter, the accused must be shown to have killed while under the actual influence of a strong passion induced by such provocation. (moye, supra, 47 cal.4th at p. 550.) [t]he passion aroused need not be anger or rage, but can be any [v]iolent, intense, high-wrought or enthusiastic emotion [citation] other than revenge. (people v. breverman (1998) 19 cal.4th 142, 163.) to satisfy the objective component, the claimed provocation must be sufficient to cause an ordinary person of average disposition to act rashly or without due deliberation and reflection, from passion rather than from judgment. (moye, supra, 47 cal.4th at p. 550; people v. beltran (2013) 56 cal.4th 935, 942.) the provocation . . . must be caused by the victim [citation], or be conduct reasonably believed by the defendant to have been engaged in by the victim. (moye, at pp. 549550.) a defendant may not set up his own standard of conduct and justify or excuse himself because in fact his passions were aroused. (people v. cole (2004) 33 cal.4th 1158, 12151216.) de novo on a lesser included offense [citation], and in doing so . . . view[s] (people v. millbrook (2014) 222 cal.app.4th 1122, 1137 (millbrook).) b. discussion it is undisputed that this incident began with rodriguez insulting wilson, the victim, while rodriguez was armed with a 24 weapon. this, alone, may have barred him from receiving the heat of passion instruction: a defendant may not provoke a fight, . . . kill an adversary and expect to reduce the crime to manslaughter by merely asserting that it was accomplished upon a people v. oropeza (2007) 151 cal.app.4th 73, 83 (oropeza) defendant is guilty of murder when he arms himself and plans to insult the victim and then kill him if the victim strikes him in resentment over the insult. people v. johnston (2003) 113 cal.app.4th 1299, 1312 (johnston), quoting 2 whartons criminal law (15th ed. 1994)  157, p. 352.) rodriguez asserts the evidence does not support any inference that he armed himself and planned to insult wilson, but instead that he merely encountered wilson by coincidence. while this may se statements indicate that he had problems with wilson in the past and that wilson had previously the trial testimony established that wilson was simply passing through the area when rodriguez loudly insulted wilson; when wilson responded to the insult, rodis hand on or near his weapon. this evidence was strong indication that rodriguez seized the opportunity to evoke a reaction out of wilson to which he could respond with his weapon. (see johnston, supra, 113 cal.app.4th at p if the defendant causes the victim to commit an act which the defendant could claim provoked him, he cannot kill the victim and claim that he was provoked, s criminal law, supra,  157, p. 352].) even categorically preclude an instruction on heat of passion manslaughter, there was 25 insufficient evidence that he shot wilson under the actual influence of a strong passion that obscured all reason. rodriguez did not take the stand at trial, leaving no direct testimonial evidence from him on his actual or subjective mental state. (moye, supra, 47 cal.4th at p. 557 [noting that defendant provided no direct testimony to support an inference he subjectively harbored strong passions during killing]; people v. lee (1999) 20 cal.4th 47, 60 [adequate provocation and heat of passion must be affirmatively demonstrated].) statements to undercover agents contradict any inference of heat of passion when rodriguez stated he shot at wilson while wilson was people v. manriquez (2005) 37 cal.4th 547, 585 (manriquez) [no was no evidence that defendant actually, subjectively, kill[ed] under the heat of passion after the shooting rodriguez sobered up real fast and appeared this neither contradicted nor undermined the (manriquez, supra, 37 cal.4th at pp. 585586 [testimony contained no indication that defendants actions reflected any sign of heat of passion at the time he commenced firing at the victim].) in addition, to satisfy the second necessary elementobjectively reasonable provocationthe must be caused by the victim and not by his own state of intoxication, trauma, or some other environmental influence. (people v. steele (2002) 27 cal.4th 1230, 1253; oropeza, supra, 151 cal.app.4th at p. 26 abnormality or has particular susceptibilities to events is irrelevant in determining whether the claimed provocation was sufficient,italics added].) he was unarmprovocation to satisfy the objective standard. (people v. lucas (1997) 55 cal.app.4th 721, 739740 [insufficient provocation where driver laughed and a backseat passenger looked at him real dirty, like he wanted to fight or something ]; manriquez, supra, 37 cal.4th at pp. 585586 [insufficient evidence of provocation taunted him to use his weapon].) even if we were to assume that the evidence required the instruction, rodriguez would be unable to clear the final hurdledemonstrating that any such error was prejudicial. the evidence presented during the defense case primarily assaulted or threatened at gun point and/or his prior interactions react out of fear or a perceived threat. in rejecting both self-defense and imperfect self-defense, the jury disbelieved that rodriguez harbored an actual fear of imminent harm. (see people v. humphreys (1996) 13 cal.4th 1073, 1083.) once it rejected these independent evidence remaining to support his further claim that moye, supra, 47 cal.4th at p. 557.) there was, however, eyewitness evidence that rodriguez shot wilson twice and then, as wilson was clutching his stomach and crying for help, fired twice more at him with his arm lowered at a 45-degree angle; the autopsy report revealed gunshot wounds chest, stomach, right arm, and back. (cf. people v. cruz 27 (2008) 44 cal.4th 636, 665 [shot fired at defenseless victim in the back negated any possible prejudice from failure to instruct on provocation/heat of passion].) finally, the fact that the jury expressly found that rodriguez premeditated and deliberated the murder is a significant corroborative, if not dispositive, factor in our determination. (see people v. wharton (1991) 53 cal.3d 522, 572 [failure to instruct on heat of passion was harmless since finding of with having acted people v. franklin (2018) 21 cal.app.5th 881, 892894 [observing tension in case law t of passion].)16 16 we would reach the same conclusion whether prejudice is measured under state law (people v. watson (1956) 46 cal.2d 818, 836 (watson)), or under federal constitutional law (chapman v. california (1967) 386 u.s. 18, 24 (chapman)). (see, generally, people v. wright (2015) 242 cal.app.4th 1461, 1495, fn. 14 [noting courts of appeal are currently debating whether the erroneous failure to instruct on provocation/heat of passion manslaughter is evaluated for prejudicial error under watson or chapman]; millbrook, supra, 222 cal.app.4th at pp. 11431146 [same]; see also people v. thomas (2013) 218 cal.app.4th 630, 633634 [addressing error under chapman after matter remanded by california supreme court to determine whether failure to instruct on heat of passion manslaughter constituted federal constitutional error; court of appeal noted defendant raised federal aspect of issue]; moye, supra, 47 cal.4th at p. 558, fn. 5 [limiting analysis to watson clearlyfederal aspect of claim and argue for application of chapman].) in his opening brief, rodriguez asserts the instructional error was of both state and federal dimension and prejudicial under either state or federal law, but adds this court is bound by california supreme 28 iv. cumulative error rodriguez contends the cumulative effect of the errors alleged denied him due process and compels reversal. in light of our disposition, there are not multiple errors to accumulate. (people v. trinh (2014) 59 cal.4th 216, 253; people v. woodruff (2018) 5 cal.5th 697, 783.) v. victim restitution amount a. relevant facts at sentencing, the trial court orally pronounced an award of $5,000 in restitution: the court: so what is the amount of restitution in this case? i believe that that was an amount that was provided for funeral and burial costs. the court: is that the total restitution, madam? [prosecutor]: that is my understanding, . . . they submitted bills, and so then this is the amount that was paid. the court: [prosecutor]: yes. the court: [defense counsel], your client has a right to have a restitution hearing if he wishes to or just stipulate to the amount. [defense counsel]: i have reviewed the amount with him, and wehe has agreed to stipulate to that amount. the court: very well. pursuant to the stipulation, there is a $5,000 restitution amount to be paid to the victimcalifornia victim compensation board through the department of corrections. 29 the court did not orally impose any interest on the restitution award. in contrast, the minute order and abstract of judgment interest from the rodriguez asserts that because the trial court failed expressly to order the imposition of interest on the restitution amount, any award of interest must be struck from the abstract of judgment. we disagree. b. governing legal principles here there is a discrepancy between the oral pronouncement of judgment and the minute order or the (people v. zackery (2007) 147 cal.app.4th 380, 385.) a sentence without an award of victim restitution, or an award without a required restitution element, is deemed unauthorized and invalid. (people v. brown (2007) 147 cal.app.4th 1213, 12251226 (brown).) a claim that a sentence is unauthorized raised for the first time on appeal, and is subject to judicial correction whenever the error comes to the attention of the people v. dotson (1997) 16 cal.4th 547, 554, fn. 6.) the reviewing court may correct an unauthorized sentence by ordering the abstract of judgment be modified. (people v. vieira (2005) 35 cal.4th 264, 294;  1260.) c. discussion the california constitution requires victim restitution in all criminal cases. (cal. const., art. i,  28, subd. (b)(13).) the legislature has further mandated the imposition of interest on every award of victim restitution. ( 1202.4, subd. (f)(3)(g); people v. wickham (2013) 222 cal.app.4th 232, 238 [under 30 section 1202.4, subdivision must fully reimburse the victim for every economic loss caused by the defendants criminal conduct, including 10 percent interest].) rodriguez insists the award of any interest is within the discretion of the trial court because subdivision (f)(3)(g) concludes with the phrase, that phrase, however, relates to the determination of whether to accrue the 10 percent rate from the date of the loss, or the date of sentencing; it does not make the interest award itself discretionary. (see people v. pangan (2013) 213 cal.app.4th 574, 581 (pangan) has to be factored into the award, italics added].) the purpose of imposing interest is to secure immediate payment of restitution. (pangan, supra, 213 cal.app.4th at p. 581.) absent a specific determination that the date of loss occurred earlier, the presumption is that interest will accrue from the time of the restitution order. (id. at p. 581, fn. 7.) here, restitution was ordered at the sentencing hearing and the abstract of judgment reflects that interest on the restitution amount shall accrue from the date of sentencing. though the trial court did not expressly impose interest when pronouncing its restitution order, a judgment without the requisite interest award is subject to correction on appeal. (brown, supra, 147 cal.app.4th at p. 1225;  1260.) as such, and commensurate with our authority under section 1260, we modify the judgment to reflect the restitution amount as it is set out in the abstract of judgment.17 17 leaving intact the imposition of 10 percent interest from the date of the sentencing not only maintains the legality of the sentence, but also results in the least costly calculation of interest to rodriguez. 31 vi. conduct credits at sentencing, rodriguez received a total of 1,075 days of presentence custody credit: 935 actual days, plus 140 days of conduct credit. the 140 days were calculated at a rate of 15 percent of the [actual] 935 days and imposed pursuant to section 2933.1. as respondent correctly points out, however, rodriguez, is statutorily prohibited from earning conduct credits. (see people v. herrera (2001) 88 cal.app.4th 1353, 1366 [defendants convicted of murder entitled to presentence credits for actual time served, but ineligible for presentence conduct credits];  2933.1, 2933.2); people v. wheeler (2003) 105 cal.app.4th 1423, 14311432 [modifying abstract to delete award of conduct credit to defendant convicted of murder].) accordingly, we order the requisite modification be made to delete the award of conduct credits. (cf. people v. sanders (2012) 55 cal.4th 731, 742, fn. 13 [appellate court can correct legal error resulting in unauthorized sentence at any time].) 32 disposition the judgment is modified to reflect the imposition of direct victim restitution in the amount of $5,000 plus 10 percent interest from the date of the sentencing (as reported in the original abstract of judgment) and to strike the award of 140 days of conduct credit. the judgment is affirmed in all other respects. the clerk of the superior court is directed to prepare an amended abstract of judgment and to forward a certified copy of the amended abstract to the department of corrections and rehabilitation. not to be published. bendix, j. we concur: rothschild, p. j. chaney, j.
