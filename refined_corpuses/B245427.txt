(see smith v. robbins (2000) 528 u.s. 259, 277-284.) on august 20, 2013, we advised defendant that he had 30 days within which to personally submit any contentions or arguments he wished us to consider. no response has been received. we examined the entire record and asked the parties to brief the following issues. first, defendant was sentenced to county jail pursuant to penal code section 1170, subdivision (h). defendant was sentenced to prison for three years on june 1, 2011, but the execution of sentence was suspended. because he was sentenced prior to october 1, 2011, he may not be committed to county jail pursuant to penal code section 1170, subdivision (h). (people v. montrose (2013) 220 cal.app.4th 1242, 1247; people v. wilcox (2013) 217 cal.app.4th 618, 621; people v. kelly (2013) 215 cal.app.4th 297, 306; people v. mora (2013) 214 cal.app.4th 1477, 1481-1482; people v. gipson (2013) 213 cal.app.4th 1523, 1528-1530.) we are persuaded thwas imposed and its execution stayed. our colleagues in division two of this appellate when the trial court first announced and imposed sentence as opposed to the time when important distinction, in probation cases, between orders suspending imposition of sentence and orders suspending execution of previously imposed (people v. howard (1997) 16 cal.4th 1081, 1087 (howardwhen the trial court suspends imposition of sentence, no judgment is then pending against the probationer, who is subject only to the terms and conditions of the probation. [citatio (ibid.) [w]here a sentence has actually been imposed but its [t]he revocation of the suspension of execution of the judgment 6 brings the former judgment into full force and effect . . . if a trial court previously had imposed sentence, [it] must order that exact sentence into effect (id. at p. 1088.) thus, under howard, imposition of sentence is equated with entry of a final judgment. when a final judgment is entered, everything about a defs sentence is prescribedpeople v. gipson, supra, 213 cal.app.4th at p. 1529.) because defendant was sentenced on june 1, 2011, prior to october 1, 2011, he must be sentenced to state prison. second, defendant has received credit for 62 days in county jail actually served plus 31 days of conduct credits. defendant is subject to penal code section 4019 as it was in effect when he began serving his term in county jail on june 12, 2009. (see people v. garcia (2012) 209 cal.app.4th 530, 535-539; stats. 1982, ch. 1234,  7, pp. 4553-4554.) the modifications to penal code section 4019, which might have been more favorable to defendant, did not go into effect until at the earliest january 25, 2010. (people v. garcia, supra, 209 cal.app.4th. at p. 535.) thus, defendant was entitled to two days of conduct credits for every four days actually served. if he served 62 days in county jail, he was only entitled to 30 days of conduct credits. there is no rounding up of conduct credits. (people v. ramos (1996) 50 cal.app.4th 810, 815, 817; people v. madison (1993) 17 cal.app.4th 783, 786-787.) defendant is currently detained in county jail. because defendant was erroneously sentenced to county jail instead of state prison, the trial court is to sentence him to prison and recalculate his custody credits once the remittitur issues. third, defendant did not receive a parole revocation fine pursuant to penal code section 1202.45. defendant was not sentenced to prison. defendant must have a penal code section 1202.45 parole restitution fine of $200 imposed because his sentence will be changed from county jail to state prison. (pen. code,  1202.45; people v. hong (1998) 64 cal.app.4th 1071, 1084.) 7 iv. disposition upon remittitur issuance, defendant is to be sentenced to state prison. defendant must have a penal code section 1202.45 parole restitution fine of $200 imposed. defendant is entitled to 30 days of conduct credits. the trial court is directed to ht of his current county jail detention. the judgment is affirmed in all other respects. not to be published in the official reports turner, p. j. we concur: kriegler, j. mink, j.* *retired judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
