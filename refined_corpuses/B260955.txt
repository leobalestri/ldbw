(a)).1 we affirm. factual and procedural background on september 1, 2014, at approximately 10:30 a.m., officer seth secor saw defendant walking towards him. witnesses told the officer that for the past several weeks defendant had parked a moped in the area. defendant would retrieve an object from the mopeds seat compartment and walk away. the witnesses thought it was possible narcotics activity. on this day, defendants moped was lawfully parked, but the officer could see that the battery was disconnected. when defendant saw the officer, defendant went behind a parked vehicle. defendant was detained. officer secor conducted a pat down for safety to see if [defendant] had any weapons. when officer secor conducted the pat down, he asked if defendant had any weapons or sharp objects, and defendant said he had a razor blade in his pocket. the officer felt a hard, rigid object in defendants pocket, which turned out to be a credit card in a name other than defendants. a check in the name of kate redman was also recovered. redman did not give anyone permission to have that check. defendant admitted that his girlfriend stole mail from residences. after a preliminary hearing, the trial court denied defendants motion to suppress the physical evidence. ( 1538.5.) but the court suppressed defendants statements, under miranda v. arizona (1966) 384 u.s. 436. the court denied a motion to dismiss. an information filed on october 28, 2014 alleged one count of receiving stolen property ( 496, subd. (a)).2 the information also alleged that defendant had three prior prison terms ( 667.5, subd. (b)). 1 all further undesignated statutory references are to the penal code. 2 while the case was pending, proposition 47 was passed and became law. the crime was therefore deemed charged as a misdemeanor. the people did not contest the reduction. 3 on november 21, 2014, defendant was advised of and waived his right to a jury. he pleaded no contest to violating section 496, subdivision (a). the trial court suspended imposition of sentence, placed defendant on two years of summary nonreporting probation, and ordered him to serve 270 days in jail. he had 82 good time/work time credits for a total of 164 custody credits. the court imposed a $150 restitution fine ( 1202.4), a $150 probation revocation fine (stayed) ( 1202.44), a $30 misdemeanor conviction assessment (gov. code,  70373), and a $40 court security fee ( 1465.8, subd. (a)(1)). discussion after review of the record, appellants court-appointed counsel filed an opening brief which raised no issues and which asked this court to conduct an independent review of the record, under people v. wende (1979) 25 cal.3d 436, 441. by letter dated february 19, 2015, we advised appellant that he had 30 days to submit by brief or letter any contentions or argument he wished this court to consider. that letter was returned, unopened, to the court.3 a criminal defendant who appeals following a plea of no contest or guilty without a certificate of probable cause can only challenge the denial of a motion to suppress evidence or raise grounds arising after the entry of the plea that do not affect the pleas validity. (cal. rules of court, rule 8.304(b).) the motion to suppress was properly denied. (terry v. ohio (1968) 392 u.s. 1; people v. osborne (2009) 175 cal.app.4th 1052, 1059-1060 & fn. 6; people v. limon (1993) 17 cal.app.4th 524, 535; see u.s. v. salas (9th cir. 1989) 879 f.2d 530, 535.) with respect to other potential sentencing or post-plea issues that do not in substance challenge the validity of the plea itself, we have examined the record and are satisfied appellate attorney has fully complied with the responsibilities of counsel and no arguable issue exists. (people v. kelly (2006) 40 cal.4th 106, 126; people v. wende, supra, 25 cal.3d at p. 441.) 3 the letter notifying appellant of appointed counsel was also returned to the court. 4disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports aldrich, j. we concur: edmon, p. j. egerton, j. judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
