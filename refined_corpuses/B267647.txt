[] it does not appear that defendant was granted a certificate of rehabilitation on may 29, 1984. the court minute order for may 29, 1984 reflects that defendant was sentenced to prison on the very same charges that defendant now claims he received a certificate of rehabilitation on the very same day. it appears that what defendant may have received is a superior court notice of the process to obtain a certificate of rehabilitation upon completion of the sentence. [] further, even if defendant received a certificate of rehabilitation and/or a pardon, the effect of such is to restore civil and political right[s]. it does not obliterate the underlying record of conviction. [citations.] the court interprets that language to mean that a prior conviction may still be used [as] an enhancement prior even if [a] certificate of rehabilitation was granted on the pr on october 5, 2015, taylor filed a notice of appeal from the denial of his motion to set aside his sentence. ~(ct 46)~ we appointed counsel to represent him on appeal. after examination of the record, counsel filed an opening brief raising no issues and asking this court to review the record independently pursuant to people v. wende (1979) 25 cal.3d 436. on january 22, 2016, we advised taylor that he personally had 30 days to submit any contentions or issues he wished us to consider. we also directed his appointed counsel to send the record and opening brief to taylor immediately. to date, we have received no response from taylor. with his responsibilities and that no arguable issues exist.
