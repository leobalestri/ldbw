(people v. perez (1979) 4 23 cal.3d 545, 551 (perez).) the trial court is tasked with determining whether the charges involve an indivisible course of s explicit or implicit factual resolupeople v. mccoy (2012) 208 cal.app.4th 1333, 1338; people v. hutchins (2001) 90 cal.app.4th 1308, 1312-1313.) in general, [w]hether a course of criminal conduct is a divisible transaction which could be punished under more than one statute within the meaning of section 654 depends on the intent and objective of the actor.people v. saffle (1992) 4 cal.app.4th 434, 438.) perez, supra, 23 incident to one objective, the defendant may be punished for any one of such offenses but not for more id. at p. 551). even where the defendant has but one objectivesexual gratificationsection 654 will not apply unless the crimes were either incidental to or the means by which another crime was (people v. alvarez (2009) 178 cal.app.4th 999, 1006; see, e.g., people v. madera (1991) 231 cal.app.3d 845, 855 [section 654 bars separate punishment for applying lubricant to the area to be copulated because the act would be preparatory]; people v. senior (1992) 3 cal.app.4th 765, 780 [multiple digital-vaginal penetrations and multiple oral copulations during single encounter may be separately punished].) the rationale for this rule is that a gratification by committing a number of base criminal acts on his victim is substantially more culpable than a defendant who (perez, supra, 23 cal.3d at p. 553.) if courts were to apply the single intent and objective test to sex crimeslewd ways, safe in the knowledge that he could not be convicted 5 (people v. scott (1994) 9 cal.4th 331, 347.) the modified rule in sex crime cases ensures that a defendant receives a punishment proportionate to his culpability. (people v. harrison (1989) 48 cal.3d 321, 335.) tsentence on count four be stayed pursuant to 654. the court we agree. here, two sexual acts occurred over the course of 20 minutes, separated by . the child testified that on the morning of december 3, 2015, defendant first positioned himself lying sideways behind her. in this position, defendant touched her back and buttocks with his penis, and her buttocks, vagina, and breasts with his hands under her clothing. subsequently, defendant repositioned the child so that she was straddling his genital area and he touched or squeezed her buttocks. an investigating police officer, who interviewed the child shortly after the incident, likewise testified to series of acts. defendant admits, and we agree, this testimony provided evidence of multiple discreet acts. the first touching that occurred when the child was lying on her side was not preparatory to the second touching that occurred when defendant repositioned the child: subsequent lewd conduct. likewise, the first touching was not incidental or inherent to defendant accomplishing the second touching. (see people v. madera, supra, 231 cal.app.3d at p. 854 [s] penis preceded the oral copulation and/or sodomy, on the occasions when such additional violations occurred, does not establish that 6 s] penis was merely incidental to or facilitative of the later acts. certainly the acts denounced by sections 288a and 286 are capable of commission without an initial touching or rubbing . . . moreover, the change of position further that these were two separate acts, even if they occurred sequentially. (people v. catelli (1991) 227 cal.app.3d 1434, 1446 [sexual acts that were separated in time and by a change in positiond separate offenses.].) defendant cites people v. jackson (2016) 1 cal.5th 269, 354-355, for the proposition that a defendant convicted of committing three separate sex offenses during a short and continuous time period in a single location can only be punished for one such offense. in jackson, the supreme court reversed the three consecutive sentences for the three sex crimes not based on section 654, but rather on section 667.61, former subdivision (g), which was only in effect until 2006. section 667.61, former subdivision (g) stated that the life imprisonment sentences mandated by that statute for specific sex crime imposed on the defendant once for any offense or offenses committed against a single victim during a single occasion. (jackson, at pp. 354-355.) that portion of the statute no longer exists and did not apply to this 2015 molestation. its holding as to those three crimes is irrelevant to our inquiry under section 654. defendant also argues that because the child did not state how long each touching lasted, the acts were within a single course of conduct. such testimony is unnecessarywhere a defendant s body with the requisite intent, a violation of section 288 has occurred. the offense ends when the defendant ceases to fondle that area. where a defendant s body and then moves 7 on to fondle a different area, one offense has ceased and another has begun. there is no requirement that the two be separated by a hiatus, or period of reflection.people v. jimenez (2002) 99 cal.app.4th 450, 456; people v. harrison, supra, 48 cal.3d at pp. 327334 [defendant may be convicted for multiple, nonconsensual sex acts of an identical nature that follow one another in quick, uninterrupted succession].) finding that the consecutive sentences did not violate section 654. disposition rubin, j. we concur: bigelow, p.j. grimes, j.
