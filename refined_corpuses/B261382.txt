(a), assault with a deadly weapon ( 245, subd. (a)), and two counts of conspiracy. the trial court found that appellant had suffered four strikes under the three strikes law ( 667, subds. (b)-(i), 1170.12, subds. (a)-(d)) in 1985, and denied his motion under people v. superior court (romero) (1996) 13 cal.4th 497 to strike those strikes. the trial court imposed a 1 all further statutory references are to the penal code. 2 rior appeal from his judgment of conviction, we take judicial notice of that opinion (people v. munns (aug. 6, 2004, b162883) 2004 cal.app.unpub. lexis 7334).

[] [appellant] did not learn his lesson, because he committed the current theft-(people v. munns, supra, 2004 cal.app. unpub. lexis at *63.) in 2012, the electorate enacted the reform act by approving proposition 36. (people v. yearwood (2013) 213 cal.app.4th 161, 169-170.) the reform act amended the three strikes law to provide that absent specified exceptions, an offender with two or more prior strikes is to be sentenced as a two strike offender unless the new offense is also a strike, that is, a serious or violent felony.3 (see ibid.) the reform act also added section 1170.126, which creates a postconviction resentencing proceeding for specified inmates sentenced under the prior version of the three strikes law. (yearwood, supra, 213 cal.app.4th at pp. 169-170.) on september 12, 2014, appellant filed a petition for resentencing under section 1170.126. in seeking resentencing, he also challenged the sentence imposed on him as a three strike offender. relying on people v. vargas (2014) 59 cal.4th 635, 638-639 (vargas)[t]reating [the 1985 robbery convictions] as separate strikes is inconsistent with the spirit of the three strikes 3 strikeviolent felonyserious felony(people v. blackburn (1999) 72 cal.app.4th 1520, 1525.) 4 law . . . , and the trial court should have dismissed [t]hree of them and sentenced [him] as if [he] had only [o]ne, not [f]our qualifying strike[] on september 18, 2104, the trial court denied the petition with prejudice, concluding that a convictions for home invasion robbery and kidnapping rendered him ineligible for resentencing under the reform act. this appeal followed. discussion -appointed counsel filed an opening brief raising no issues, and requested this court to review the record independently pursuant to wende. in addition, counsel advised appellant of his right to submit by supplemental brief any contentions or argument he wished the court to consider. in response, appellant submitted a supplemental brief and other documents, including what appears to be a request that we consider the appeal to be -- or to be accompanied by -- a petition for writ of habeas corpus.4 regarding the appeal, our independent review of the record discloses no is ineligible for resentencing under section 1170.126. under that statute, a defendant is eligible for resentencing if he or she is serving an indeterminate term of life imposed under the three strikes law not defined as serious and/or violent felonies by subdivision (c) of [s]ection 667.5 or subdivision (c) of [s]ection ( 1170.126, subd. (e)(1), italics added; people v. brimmer 4 in july 2015, appellant submitted a request for appointment of counsel, which was returned to him because he already had appointed counsel on appeal. later, on august 7, 2015, this court received a copy of a petition for writ of habeas corpus filed in superior court, together with a copy of an order denying that petition. on september 9, 2015, submission . . . is not a matter on appeal . . . but, rather, is a petition (newly filed) by us in 5 (2014) 230 cal.app.4th 782, 788.) as the trial court noted, appellant does not satisfy that requirement -- namely, his 2002 conviction for home invasion robbery -- is defined as a violent felony in subdivision (c)(9) of section 667.5. appellantrief identifies several potential issues predicated on his contention that under vargas, his 1985 robbery convictions were improperly treated as four separate strikes, rather than as a single strike. he maintains that the trial court, in ruling on his petition for resentencing, improperly ignored his contention under vargas, denied him an adequate opportunity to support it, and conducted no examination of the record of conviction sufficient to resolve it. appellant also maintains that in this appeal, his appointed counsel has performed deficiently by failing to assert or investigate his contention under vargas. as explained below, nothing before us suggests (1) unlawful under vargas, (2) that the trial court erred in denying his petition for resentencing, or (3) that his appellate counsel has rendered ineffective assistance. in vargas, our supreme court concluded that in a certain or situation, two felonies individually classifiable as strikes may be treated only as a single strike, for purposes of the three strikes law. (vargas, supra, 59 cal.4th at pp. 639-640, 649.) there, the defendant was convicted of first degree burglary, and sentenced as a three strike offender on the basis of two prior convictions for carjacking and robbery predicated on the same act of force against the same victim. (id. at pp. 639-640.) the sole question before the supreme court was whether the trial court, in imposing the three strikes sentence, improperly denied the (id. at p. 640.) the court observed that two convictions may qualify as separate strikes even though they were adjudicated in the same trial, or arose from a single course of conduct, for purposes of section 654. (vargas, supra, at pp. 638-639.) 6 the court nonetheless held that under the three strikes law, one of two convictions must be dismissed when the offenses arose out of a single act against a single victim. (id. at pp. 637, 649.) nothing before us supports sentence under vargas. generally, an unauthorized sentence may be corrected at any time, but only when the record demonstrates the error in the sentence, without necessitating further factual determinations. (people v. smith (2001) 24 cal.4th 849, 852.) before the trial court and on appeal, appellant has neither shown nor alleged facts showing that his four 1985 robbery convictions arose from a single act against a single victim. although his petition for resentencing asserted that his because the convictions were predicated on a plea agreement, the circumstances surrounding the crimes were never resolved by a jury or other fact finder. on appeal, appellant appears to acknowledge that the convictions do not involve the extraordinary circumstances set forth in vargas, but argues that they qualify as a single strike because they were le it is true that [appellant] had a prior conviction that involved more than one victim, his plea deal involved comb[in]ing these cases as if they were one case. [appellant] contends that is why he only received one sentence for these robberies. these prior cases were either dropped appellant has thus failed even to allege facts which -- if found to be true -- would show that the 1985 robbery convictions fall under vargas.5 5 three strikes sentence on grounds unrelated to vargas that also hinge on his contention that the four 1985 robbery because his 1985 robbery convictions involved a single act, they were improperly used to enhance his sentence, and that section 654 barred the imposition of multiple punishments (fn. continued on next page.) 7 in view of the deficiencies in vargas, the trial court did not err in disregarding it. ordinarily, a trial court lacks jurisdiction to resentence a defendant after execution of sentence has begun. (people v. brown (2014) 230 cal.app.4th 1502, 1511 (brown).) section 1170.126 establishes a tightly confined procedure enabling specified defendants serving three strike sentences to seek resentencing. (brown, supra, 230 cal.app.4th at pp. 1509-1512.) under the statute, a court may not resentence defendants unless they meet the specified eligibility criteria. (id. at pp. 1511-1512.) the court has no more of [them], section 1170.126 grants the . . . court no power to do anything but (id. at p. 1511.) thus, for example, the court has no authority to strike a prior strike pursuant to romero in ruling on such a petition. (id. at p. 1514.) similarly, tigibility criteria is limited. (people v. bradford (2014) 227 cal.app.4th 1322, 1336-1337.) tan examination of the record of conviction. (id. at pp. 1336-1340.) although the defendant is entitled to submit briefing on the question of eligibility, the court is not obliged to hold a formal hearing on that issue. (id. at pp. 1341-1342.) under the circumstances, section 1170.126 mandated the denial of ue to his ineligibility for relief. afailed to allege facts that would establish that his sentence was unlawful under vargas. the court was thus upon determining for them. however, as appellant has failed to allege the circumstances surrounding the crimes, he has identified no potential illegality in his sentence. furthermore, as his contentions could have been raised in his appeal from the judgment of conviction, they are not cognizable in this appeal. (people v. howerton (1953) 40 cal.2d 217, 220.) 8 no power to do anything but deny the petition . . . . (brown, supra, 230 cal.app.4th at pp. 1510, 1512, italics deleted.) accordingly, aregarded as having rendered ineffective assistance contention under vargas and his related contentions. generally, counsel is not obliged to raise contentions that are reasonably judged to be futile. (people v. price (1991) 1 cal.4th 324, 387.) that is the case here. to this court as a petition for writ of habeas corpus. generally, to secure relief by writ of habeas people v. duvall (1995) 9 cal.4th 464, 474, italics deletedfactual allegations suggesting his entitlement to relief. in sum, because the record conclude that no arguable issues exist.
