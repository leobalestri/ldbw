a phone call to his girlfriend from jail, telling her to take the money from his closet and spend it on herself because he did not want his family to find the money. discussion consecutive sentences defendant contends that the trial court abused its discretion by imposing consecutive sentences on counts 6 and 11. defendant reasons that because counts 6 and 11 , respectively, the utive sentences was invalid because counts 5 and 6, and 10 and 11, were not separate acts of violence.5 defendant also contends that the 5 defendant points to purported legal errors in the as the sentence imposed on may 7, 2015, was not the final sentence, we review this hearing only to the extent that the 7 trial court improperly weighed the sentencing factors, senteimprisonment. relevant proceedings the may 7, 2015 sentencing hearing at the may 7, 2015 sentencing hearing, the court the wagners made statements explaining the lasting fears they suffer resulting from defendant pointing a gun at them and 6 mctavish trial court relied on the statements and arguments presented at that time. 6 michelle wagner described how her life had changed as a result of the robbery and her hope to heal with time. she is terrified to walk after dark and suffers panic attacks. she pictured life without her daughter, or her daughter being terribly injured. she has nightmares and headaches several times a month. nicole wagner explained the fear she felt when defendant pointed the gun toward her. she lived in poverty 8 chance to be a contributing member to the community, and a very lengthy friends gave statements asking for leniency because defendant was young, was the only father figure to his had acted under financial pressure during a period of unemployment. they also requested that the court give defendant a second chance so he could rehabilitate himself. defendant made a statement, that everything be defense counsel asked the trial court to impose a principal term of 15 years, composed of the high term of five years plus a 10-year enhancement for use of a firearm, and for the remaining sentences to run concurrently. counsel argued that a shorter sentence was warranted because time of the offenses, the crimes happened over a 20-day period, and no actual physical harm had been done to the victims. when asked by the court to address its discretion to run the sentences concurrently, defense counsel argued for concurrent sentences because the purpose of sentencing is and suffered eviction after defendant robbed her of her rent money. 9 the prosecutor argued there were insufficient mitigating circumstances to justify concurrent sentences. the prosecutor believed that the only factor in mitigationwas negated by the number of criminal acts he committed. defendant showed no real remorse or acceptance of responsibility. the court sentenced defendant to 43 years in state prison. it selected count three as the principal term and imposed the middle term of three years plus ten years on the firearm enhancement. the court selected the middle term es for the remaining counts, noting it was exercising its discretion to run the sentences consecutively because of the high degree of violence (counts 6 and 11), the separate nature of the offenses (counts 5, 7, 9, and 10), and multiple victims (count 8). the july 28, 2015 sentencing hearing on june 5, 2015, during an unreported chambers conference, the trial court invoked section 1170, subdivision (d), and recalled and vacated the sentence imposed on may 7, 2015. the court held a second sentencing hearing on july 28, 2015, incorporating the material previously received and 10 the sentence of 43 years and reconsidered the statements -- victim impact statements provided by the people as to rebecca sentence to 34 years 4 months by imposing concurrent sentences in counts 7 and 8. it again selected count 3 as the principal term, imposed the middle term sentence, and imposed a consecutive sentence for the firearm enhancement. the court imposed consecutive sentences in analysis a trial court has discretion when choosing to impose a concurrent or consecutive sentence for an offense. ( 669, subd. (a); people v. sandoval (2007) 41 cal.4th 825, 850.) a single aggravating factor may justify consecutive sentences. (people v. davis (1995) 10 cal.4th 463, 552; people v. king (2010) 183 cal.app.4th 1281, 13231324.) the criteria affecting the decision to impose consecutive rather than to the crimes, including whether or not: [] (1) the crimes and their objectives were predominantly independent of each other; [] (2) the crimes involved separate acts of violence or threats of violence; or [] (3) the crimes were committed at different times or separate places, rather than being committed so closely in time and place as to indicate a single (cal. rules of court, rule 4.425 11 (a)7; people v. thurs (1986) 176 cal.app.3d 448, 451452 (thurs) [consecutive sentence not an abuse of discretion where defendant committed robbery of two victims at the same time and place].) impose a particular sentence is reviewed for abuse of discretion and irrational or arbitrary that no reasonable person could agree people v. jones (2009) 178 cal.app.4th 853, 860861; accord, people v. bradford (1976) 17 cal.3d 8, 20.) defense counsel did request concurrent sentences be imposed, but he did not expressly object on the ground that the court relied on an improper factor in aggravation when imposing consecutive sentences. to the extent defendant argues the court relied on an improper factor in aggravation to support the consecutive sentences, the issue is forfeited manner in which the trial court exercises its sentencing discretion and articulates its supporting reasons cannot be people v. scott (1994) 9 cal.4th 331, 356 (scotts statement of reasons are easily prevented and corrected if called to the courtid. at p. 353.) the rule announced in scott courts failure to properly make or articulate its discretionary sentencing choices. included in this category 7 subsequent citations to rules are to the california rules of court. 12 are cases in which the stated reasons allegedly do not apply to the particular case, and cases in which the court purportedly erred because it double-counted a particular sentencing factor, misweighed the various factors, or failed to state any reasons or give a sufficient number of valid ibid.) even if the issue had been preserved, it fails on the merits. as noted above, only one aggravating factor is required to support a consecutive sentence. the court here this is an inappropriate basis for consecutive sentences as to the offenses against two victims on one occasion is wrong as a matter of law. california law has long recognized that violent crimes against multiple victims may be separately punished. (people v. latimer (1993) 5 cal.4th 1203, 1212; neal v. state of california (1960) 55 cal.2d 11, 2021, disapproved of on another ground in people v. correa (2012) 54 cal.4th 331 and superseded by statute on another ground as stated in people v. salmorin (2016) 1 cal.app.5th 738; thurs, supraseveral victims, an act of violence is separate when it exposes one of the victims to a risk of injury that is not authority. within rule 4.425 (a)(2). the offenses in counts 6 and 11, although committed at the same time as counts 5 and 10, 13 respectively, involved separate acts of violence or threats of violence when defendant pointed his gun at each of the victims. sentences in counts 6 and 11 was an abuse of discretion because the mitigating circumstances overwhelmed the circumstance in aggravation is no more than a request that we reweigh the evidence and impose our judgment over that of the trial court. this is not our function. (scott, supra, 9 cal.4th at p. 355 [appellate court there were arguable circumstances in mitigation, which the trial court understood, rejection of those circumstances was not unreasonable as a matter of law. for example, age meant that he was less culpable and more capable of miller v. alabama (2012) ___ u.s. ___ [132 s.ct. 2455], graham v. florida (2010) 560 u.s. 48, and roper v. simmons (2005) 543 u.s. 551. these supreme court authorities do not apply to defendant, who is not a minor. (people v. perez (2016) 3 cal.app.5th 612, 618; people v. argeta (2012) 210 cal.app.4th 1478, 1482; people v. abundio (2013) 221 cal.app.4th 1211, 12201221.) the trial youth, but in the end the court determined the counts in question warranted consecutive sentences. 14 crimes were committed so closely in time as to indicate a single period of aberrant behavior. (rule 4.425 (a)(3).) the multiple offenses, spanning 20 days and involving multiple offenses at different locations, was not aberrant behavior. defendant did not voluntarily cease his criminal activity. of wrongdoing before arrest or at an early stage of proceedings is a factor in mitigation].) he was captured shortly after his final robbery, as a result of oliver reporting the license plate number of the getaway car to the police. even after the oliver robbery, defendant engaged in behavior inconsistent with an offender seeking to end a brief period of criminality. defendant was captured as he attempted to throw away stolen cell phones, called his girlfriend from jail and urged her to remove $9,000 from his residence, and complained at sentencing that it was unfair defendant argues that no victim was physically injured, but this circumstance did not compel the trial court to impose concurrent sentences. none of the victims offered physical resistance when confronted by defendant at gunpoint. the exercise of prudent judgment by victims held at gunpoint and the absence of gratuitous violence by defendant is not the type of mitigation that requires concurrent sentences as a matter of law. the argument also overlooks the harm done by defendant, as evidenced by the 15 statements of michelle and nicole wagner describing their ongoing fears and the trauma caused by defendant. ineffective assistance of counsel defendant contends that trial counsel abdicated his court precedents . . . e as explained above, the premise of these contentions is incorrectthe trial court properly found a circumstance in aggravation, and the supreme court precedents did not for objection,ablish ineffective of counsel at sentencing. (people v. cudjo (1993) 6 cal.4th 585, 616.) defendant has failed to establish deficient conduct by counsel or prejudice; his claim of inadequate representation therefore fails. (strickland v. washington (1984) 466 u.s. 668, 687688.) 16 disposition the judgment is affirmed. kriegler, acting p.j. we concur: baker, j. kumar, j. judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
