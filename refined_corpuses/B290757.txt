february 2, 2017; and may 4, 2017. ford did not appear on may 23, 2017, pursuant to a subpoena personally served on her earlier that month, and another body attachment issued. the next scheduled court date was august 9, 2017, when the jury trial was set to begin. on august 7, 2017, the prosecutor called ford and left a voice message. he also texted and e-mailed her. but ford failed to appear on august 9, 2017, and the trial court issued another body attachment. later that night, the prosecutor received an e-mail response from ford providing a new telephone number, which he called, left a voice message for, and texted the following day. the prosecutor received a return text from the new number ford had provided informing him that he had the wrong number. the prosecutor e-mailed ford the next day, august 11, 2017, but did not receive a response. 12 on august 15, 2017, at approximately 9:50 a.m. and 2:00 p.m., a senior district attorney investigator attempted to serve ford at the address where he had previously successfully served her with a subpoena in may 2017. no one responded when the investigator knocked at the door. a housing authority e on it was on the screen door. he spoke with the building manager, who recognized fname and photograph and confirmed that she lived at that address. the investigator returneaugust 16, 2017, at approximately 7:00 a.m. and 2:30 p.m. both times, he knocked on the door but received no response. he left a business card in the screen door during his afternoon attempt. he returned to the apartment again the next day, august 17, 2017, at approximately 7:15 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. again, there was no response to his knocks on the door, and he saw the business card that he had left the day before lying on the front porch. he also checked with the los angeles county ve results from both inquiries. ent a final time at approximately 7:00 a.m. on august 18, 2017, but there was no response. he called ford that morning and left a message. 2. testimony from the november 17, 2016 preliminary hearing the trial court held a hearing on the motion that day, during which the district attorney investigator testified under oath and the 13 prosecutor made unswo . . very the court questioned why the investigator did not go attendance. notwithstanding these reservations, the trial court bala that she remained unavailable. accordingly, the court admitted b. relevant law and standard of review against him is guaranteed under both the federal and state constitutions. (u.s. const., 6th amend.; cal. const., art. i,  15; people v. herrera (2010) 49 cal.4th 613, 620 (herrera).) the unavailable at trial and has given testimony at a previous court proceeding against the same defendant at which the defendant had the opportunity to cross-examine the witness, the previous testimony may be admitted at trial. in a criminal case, the prosecution bears the burden of showing that the witness is -[citation] or, equivalently, exercised reasonable or due diligence people v. snchez (2016) 63 cal.4th 411, 440 (snchez).) 14 people v. linder (1971) 5 cal.3d 342, 346347.) whether due diligence has been exercised is a case-specific inquiry. (see id. at p. 346.) search, the snchez, supra, 63 cal.4th at p. 440.) historical facts if supported by substantial evidence, but . . . snchez, supra, 63 cal.4th at p. 440.) c. analysis presence at trial, we conclude that the people exercised due testimony. until august 7, 2017, the prosecutor believed that ford was a cooperative witness. dissuade her from testifying, ford appeared in court in may 2016 to take place. she appeared on october 24, 2016, as well as on november 17, 2016, when she testified at the preliminary hearing. ford spoke to the prosecutor about the case on december 6, 2016; february 2, 2017; and may 4, 2017. as trial approached, the prosecutor called, texted, and e-mailed ford on august 7, 2017. he received a response to his e-mail two days later providing a new phone number for ford, 15 which he called and texted. whether intentional or not, the new -mail to ford informing her of the wrong number did not receive a response. once the investigator became involved in the search for ford, he went to her apartment seven times over a four-day period and called her. he confirmed that ford still lived at the address by speaking with the building manager and observing a notice addressed to ford on the door. he made inquiries with the sdepartment and the coroner. that its efforts to locate and produce [ford] for trial were (herrera, supra, 49 cal.4th at p. 623.) we conclude that the prosecution met its burden. social media, make inquiries with other government agencies or nearby hospitals, or talk to daniels or to have been made or other lines of inquiry pursued does not affect this conclusion. [citation.] it is enough that the people used snchez, supra, 63 cal.4th at p. 448.)7 thus, once the threshold showing of reasonableness has been made, as was made here, the mere existence of additional efforts that could have been used does not disturb the due-diligence finding. 7 for this reason, the trial court ultimately concluded that during the evening did not affect its finding of due diligence. 16 defendant also argues that the trial court should not have efforts to contact ford and that the prosecution should have continued to search for ford after the court ruled that she was unavailable.8 we find these contentions meritless. first, the trial court could properly exercise its discretion to without requiring him to testify formallyto determine whether due diligence had been exercised. in people v. smith (2003) 30 cal.4th 581 (smith), the id. at p. 611) in part based on the 8 -examined ford at the preliminary hearing because it was for case number ya095110. case number ya095110, which charged defendant with six counts of attempting to dissuade a witness ( 136.1, subd. (a)(2)), was consolidated on january 9, 2017, into case number ya094029, which had originally charged defendant with corporal injury ( 273.5, subd. (f)(2)), criminal threats ( 422, subd. (a)), and dissuading a witness ( 136.1, subd. (b)(1)). but defendant fails to present cogent legal authority or argument concerning this contention, and we therefore consider it forfeited. (see people v. stanley (1995) 10 cal.4th 764, 793 [a court may treat as waived a point in a brief made without reasoned argument or authority].) but even if we were to consider this argument, we of an unavailable witness to be admissible at trial under -examining the be at trial. (people v. zapien (1993) 4 cal.4th 929, 975.) reviewing the record before us, we conclude that defendant did have a sufficiently similar motive. 17 id. at p. prosecution made reas(id. at p. 611.) we find no error here in considering the 9 given that address the judge solemnly upon a matter before the court, their declarations holloway v. arkansas (1978) 435 u.s. 475, 486; see also people v. laudermilk officer of the court as t prosecution had a duty to continue searching for ford even after the trial court ruled that she was unavailable. the cases cited by defendant are readily distinguishable and do not stand for such a proposition. for example, in burns v. clusen (7th cir. 1986) 798 f.2d 931, the seventh circuit court of appeals held that it was 9 in re zeth s. (2003) 31 cal.4th 396, 413414, fn. unsworn statements of counsel in re zeth s. of a dependency proceeding in order to prove changed circumstances. (ibid.) 18 witness was unavailable because of a mental disability. (id. at p. early ruling of unavailability, and there is a delay until the start remains upon the prosecutor to offer current information proving ibid.) here, the court ruled that ford was unavailable because she could not be located on august 18, 2017, and her preliminary hearing testimony was read to the jury just five days later on august 23, 2017. we find no error. y admitted based on her unavailability. injury conviction. defendant contends his conviction for corporal injury under section 273.5 (count 1) must be reversed because there is insufficient evidence that he was in a dating relationship with ford. we conclude otherwise. evidence to support a conviction, we review the entire record in the light most favorable to the judgment to determine whether it contains substantial evidencethat is, evidence that is reasonable, credible, and of solid valuefrom which a reasonable trier of fact could find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable support of the judgment the existence of every fact the trier could people v. powell (2018) 5 cal.5th 921, 944.) under section 273.5, subdivisions (a) and (b)(3), an offender is guilty of a felony if he 19 offender has, or previously had, a[] . . intimate associations primarily characterized by the expectation of affectional or sexual involvement independent of financial 243, subd.

(people v. upsher (2007) 155 cal.app.4th 1311, 13221323 (upshercasual relationship or an ordinary fraternization between [two] individuals . . id. at p. 1323.) and defendant either had or were in a dating relationship within the meaning of the statute. ford testified that defendant was her ex-boyfriend, who she had dated for a few months. on the night of the incident, ford told deputy patino that defendant was her boyfriend and that they had been dating for three months. ford dated defendant for a few months. on the 911 call, daniels described and, although defendant denied having a dating relationship with ford, he testified that he saw her about seven or eight times between december 2015 and february 2016 when he would come to town from las vegas. 20 from this evidence a reasonable juror could find beyond a upsher, supra, 155 cal.app.4th at p. 1323) nt, intimate associations( 243, subd. (f)(10)) sufficient to constitute a dating relationship. iii. substantial evidence supports the true finding on defend the trial court found true the allegation that defendant suffered a prior conviction in 1998 for voluntary manslaughter ( 192, subd. (a)). defendant argues that the true finding must be reversed because it was based on an unsigned, uncertified abstract of judgment. we disagree. . . trial on prior conviction allegations ( 1025) . . . include[s] various procedural guaranties: the prosecution must prove the prior conviction allegation beyond a reasonable doubt, the defendant enjoys the privilege against self-incrimination and the right to confront and cross-examine witnesses against him, and the rules of evidence people v. henley (1999) 72 cal.app.4th 555, 564.) under section 969b, the prosecution can meet its burden of proving a prior conviction by introducing certified copies of prison records.10 (people v. brucker (1983) 148 cal.app.3d 230, 241 10 prima facie evidence of the fact that a person being tried for a crime or public offense under the laws of this state has been convicted of an act punishable by imprisonment . . . and has served a term therefor in any penal institution, . . . the records or copies of records of any state penitentiary . . . in which such person has been imprisoned, when such records or copies thereof 21 (brucker(people v. martinez (2000) 22 cal.4th 106, 116 (martinez).) commonly referred to as a 969b packetpeople v. moreno (2011) 192 cal.app.4th 692, 707), included a chronological log of f corrections and rehabilitation, abstracts of judgment, fingerprint cards, and a photograph of defendant. the cover page of the 969b packet was a signed letter from a correctional case of corrections[] is the official legal custodian of the records of prisoners committed to the california state prisons and had [the analyst] to certify . . . the criminal records of the analyst further certified that the accompanying documents custody . . . among the documents in the 969b packet was an abstract of judgment for case number cr60589 out of riverside county indicating that defendant was convicted of voluntary manslaughter on april 8, 1998, and received an eight-year sentence. although bearing the stamp of the riverside county superior court, the abstract of judgment was not signed by the clerk. have been certified by the official custodian of such records, may 22 defendant argues that the unsigned, uncertified abstract of judgment does not constitute proper, admissible evidence that he suffered the voluntary manslaughter conviction. he asserts that subdivision (a) of [evidence code] 11 (evid. code,  452.5, subd. (b)(1)) is the exclusive means of proving a prior conviction. and 452.5, subdivision (b), a properly certified copy of an official court record is a self-authenticated document that is presumptively reliable, and standing alone may be sufficient to people v. skiles (2011) 51 cal.4th 1178, 1186), these statutes do not limit the means of proving a prior conviction to this method alone (see id. at pp. 11861187). section 969b explicitly provides that certified prison records constitute prima facie evidence of a prior conviction. and, other than the record of conviction and certified prison records (martinez, supra, 22 cal.4th at p. 116.) 11 evidence code section 1530, subdivisions (a)(1) and (2), the custody of a public entity . . . is prima facie evidence of the existence and content of such writing or entry if: [] . . . [t]he copy purports to be published by the authority of the . . . public entity . . . in which the writing is kept; [or] [] . . . [t]he office in which the writing is kept is within the united states . . . and the copy is attested or certified as a correct copy of the writing . . . by a public employee, or a deputy of a public employee, having the 23 require that each separate prison document be individually brucker, supra, 148 cal.app.3d at p. 241.) rather, a single certification applicable to all prison documents in a 969b packet is sufficient. (id. at pp. 240241.) defendant argues, particular record in the packet is itself required to be certified such as an abstract of people v. matthews (1991) 229 cal.app.3d 930 (matthews) for this proposition is misplaced. matthews considered the admissibility of uncertified computer the computer-id. at p. 938.) the court of appeal concluded that, without a proper foundation, the records were inadmissible under either the business records exception or official records exception to the hearsay rule. (id. at p. 940 & fn. 6.) matthews did not consider the admissibility of an abstract of judgment maintained as a prison record and included as part of a certified 969b packet(id. at p. 938).12 12 we also question the extent to which matthews, supra, 229 cal.app.3d 930 is still good law. (see martinez, supra, 22 cal.4th at p. 116 [agreeing with people v. dunlap (1993) 18 cal.app.4th 1468 (dunlap)and impliedly rejecting matthewsdictumthat the fact of a prior conviction may be proven by evidence other than the record of conviction or certified prison records]; dunlap, supra, at pp. 14731476 [disagreeing with and casting doubt on the legal reasoning of matthews].) 24 the abstract of judgment at issue here was unsigned, but it bore the stamp of the superior court, as well as a stamp indicating that it was filed in the superior court. and, it was introduced as part of a properly certified 969b packet. the abstractrecord of the convictipeople v. delgado (2008) 43 cal.4th 1059, 1070) was properly admitted and voluntary manslaughter conviction. (see id. at pp. 1064, 10701071 [affirming true finding of prior conviction based on abstract of judgment included in a 969b packet].) nor do we discern a risk of injustice in this case. defendant does not argue or point to anything in the record suggesting that the abstract of judgment was not, in fact, an accurate record of the fact of his conviction. moreover, defendant himself submitted a copy of the same unsigned abstract of judgment, as well as his executed plea agreement in which he agreed to plead guilty to voluntary manslaughter in case number cr60589, as an exhibit to his motion to strike his prior convictions. iv. the matter must be remanded for the trial court to serious felony enhancements pursuant to sb 1393. while this appeal was pending, sb 1393, effective january 1, 2019, amended section 667, subdivision (a), and section 1385, subdivision (b), to give trial courts discretion to strike the imposition of a five-year sentencing enhancement for a 25 prior serious felony conviction. (people v. garcia (2018) 28 cal.app.5th 961, 971 (garcia).) sb 1393 applies retroactively to nonfinal judgments of conviction where a serious felony enhancement was imposed at sentencing. (id. at pp. 971972.) remand is required to allow a court to exercise its new discretion would not have reduced the sentence even if at the time of people v. almanza (2018) 24 cal.app.5th 1104, 1110; see also garcia, supra, at p. 973, fn. 3.) we agree with the parties that the trial court did not clearly indicate whether it would strike the serious felony enhancements if it had discretion to do so. therefore, the matter must be remanded for the trial court to consider striking one or -year enhancements imposed under section 667, subdivision (a)(1). v. upon resentencing, the trial court must prepare an amended abstract of judgment. the people correctly note that the abstract of judgment only reflects the imposition of one five-year enhancement under section 667, subdivision (a)(1), which conflicts with the oral pronouncement of judgment and the minute order. the oral pronouncement of judgment controls when it differs from the abstract of judgment. (people v. mitchell (2001) 26 cal.4th 181, 185.) accordingly, after the trial court determines whether to strike one or both serious felony enhancements, it shall prepare an amended abstract of judgment that accurately reflects 26 disposition the matter is remanded for resentencing pursuant to section 667, subdivision (a), and section 1385, subdivision (b), as amended by sb 1393. upon resentencing, the trial court is directed to prepare an amended abstract of judgment and forward a certified copy of it to the department of corrections and rehabilitation. in all other respects, the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. _____________________, acting p. j. ashmann-gerst we concur: ________________________, j. chavez ________________________, j. hoffstadt
