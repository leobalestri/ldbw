(a)(1))),1 resisting an executive officer (count 2;  69), and custodial possession of a weapon (count 3;  4502, subd. (a)). the trial court sentenced him to consecutive terms of 25 years to life on each count, for a total of 75 years to life. he was granted 507 days of custody credits; various fines and fees were imposed. defendant appealed. on july 11, 2011, we affirmed the convictions could be separately punished pursuant to section 654. (people v. sanchez (july 11, 2011, b221712) [nonpub. opn.] (sanchez).) after the enactment of proposition 36, defendant filed a petition for recall of sentence pursuant to section 1170.126. on december 8, 2014, the trial court denied the petition, finding that assault with a deadly weapon (count 1) is a serious felony, disqualifying defendant from resentencing on all counts. defendant appealed, and on august 7, 2015, this court reversed, finding that defendant was eligible for recall of sentence and resentencing on count 2 even though count 1 was a serious felony. (people v. trinidad (aug. 7, 2015, b261072) [nonpub. opn.], at p. 4 (trinidad i).) on remand, the trial court ordered the not be granted as to counts 2 and 3. after on the grounds that defendant intended to cause great bodily 1 all further statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise indicated. 3 injury when he threw heavy and dangerous pieces of porcelain at deputies and he was armed with a deadly weapon, i.e., heavy and sharp chunks of porcelain. defendant timely filed a notice of appeal. he argues, inter alia, that under the doctrine of the law of the case, this csanchez) that e was separate from the charged assault (count 1) offenses consisted of the same course of conduct and comprised an indivisible transaction. we agree with defendant that the doctrine of law of the case appconsisted of the same course of conduct is precluded by our determination in sanchez that the offenses were separate and divisible and thus properly subject to separate sentences (and not subject to  654). thus, the matter must be remanded for rehearing for the recall court to decide whether resentencing defendant would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. ( 1170.126, subds. (f) & (g).) factual background2 on august 25, 2008, defendant was a prisoner in the los 3100a row, which contained 26 single-occupancy cells. during a mass disturbance, prisoners in the row threw trash and debris everywhere, including some pieces of porcelain on the floor of the row. in an effort to quell the disturbance, the jail guards, los through the row to extract prisoners one by one. as the guards 2 the summary of facts comes from our july 11, 2011, opinion.
