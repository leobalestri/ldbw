(people v. austin (mar. 2, 2018, no. b282537) [nonpub. opn.].) while that appeal was pending, appellant petitioned the trial court for resentencing under penal code section 12022.53, which had recently been revised.1 the trial court denied his petition. appellant appealed, and his appointed counsel filed a brief requesting that we independently review the record for error pursuant to people v. wende (1979) 25 cal.3d 436 (wende). we dismiss the appeal. a criminal defendant is entitled to review under wende on a first appeal as a matter of right. as this is an appeal from a petition for resentencing, not a first appeal as a matter of right, appellant is not entitled to wende review. as neither appellant nor his counsel have asserted any appealable issues, dismissal is appropriate. factual and procedural background we described the underlying case from our prior opinion, people v. austin, supra, (march 2, 2018, b282537) (nonpub. opn.) as follows: appellant mahealani leialohakala austin and two codefendants used a gun to steal money from several antelope valley pharmacies and pizza restaurants during 2011 and 2012. 1all further statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise indicated. 3 a 31-count information filed july 17, 2014 charged the trio with numerous counts of second degree robbery and kidnapping to commit robbery, as well as other related offenses, including conspiracy to commit robbery and making criminal threats, plus firearm enhancements. all three defendants faced life in prison due to the aggravated kidnapping charges, which the court declined to section 995 motions. pursuant to a plea agreement, appellant pled no contest to one interlineated count of kidnapping (pen. code,  207, subd. (a)), three counts of robbery ( 211), one count of attempted robbery ( 211 & 664), and one count of conspiracy to commit robbery ( 182, subd. (a) & 211). he also admitted section 12022.53, subdivision (b) allegations as to each count. in exchange, he was sentenced to a term of 35 years, calculated as follows: the high term of eight years on the kidnapping count, plus an additional 10 years for the related firearm enhancement [under section 12022.53, subdivision (b)]; one yearone-third the midtermon each of the three robbery counts, plus three years, four monthsone-third the midtermon each of the related firearm enhancements [under section 12022.53, subdivision (b)]; eight monthsone-third the midtermon the attempted robbery, plus three years, four monthsone-third the midtermon the related firearm enhancement [under section 12022.53, subdivision (b)]; and the mid-term of three years on the conspiracy count, to run concurrent to all of the other charges. [end of quotation from people v. austin, supra.] appellant appealed, and we affirmed the conviction. (ibid.) while that appeal was pending, section 12022.53 was revised by senate bill no. 620 (2017-2018 reg. sess.). 4 ( 12022.53, subd. (h); as amended by stats. 2017, ch. 682,  2.) the revision gave the trial court discretion, in limited circumstances, to strike a firearm enhancement in the interest of justice. in february 2018 defendant filed a petition for resentencing under section 12022.53, subdivision (h). the court gun allegation is denied. the defendant entered into a negotiated appellant timely appealed and requested a certificate of probable cause. no certificate of probable cause or ruling on appeal. discussion matter of right, the court of appeal must independently review the record if appointed counsel represents he or she has found no arguable issues.
