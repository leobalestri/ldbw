(a)), specifically, rock cocaine, and admitted two prior strike allegations ( 667, subds. (b)-(i), 1170.12, subds. (a)-(d)), for second degree robbery ( 211). during the prior robberies, defendant had pointed a firearm at one of his victims. defendant was sentenced to 25 years to life in state prison. in prison, defendant sustained a number of rules violations. on october 13, 2001, correctional officers heard slapping sounds the cell and found defendant punching his cellmate in the head and face. after breaking up the fight, they found, among defenda 6 1/8 inches-long inmate-manufactured weapon that could be used for stabbing. defendant denied that the weapon belonged to him. the department of corrections and rehabilitation (the department) sustained a finding that defendant had battered an inmate and had possessed a deadly weapon. on august 7, 2002, a correctional officer heard a metal grinding noise coming 1 further statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise indicated. 3 leaning over a cardboard box and moving his hand back and forth along his cell floor. the officer observed defendant try to conceal something in his left hand, and then heard a metal object fall on the floor as defendant turned. the officer demanded that defendant show him the item. defendant grabbed a tennis shoe, pulled out the sole of the shoe, and showed the officer an object before flushing the object down the toilet. the officer described the object as being four inches long, with a sharpened point. defendant contended that the object was a straightened-out paperclip, which he had used to cut his shower shoes. at the conclusion of the hearing process, defendant was found to have possessed dangerous contraband. on august 11, 2004, defendant yelled to a corrections officer that he had a weapon and was going to use it to stick another inmate, because that inmate had tried to stick him. at the time, defendant was holding a weapon. defendant and the other inmate did not initially follow instructions to lie on the floor and both had to be sprayed in the face. the officer later found an inmate-manufactured weapon that was 3 1/2 inches long, with a sharpened point. the department sustained a finding that defendant possessed a deadly weapon. on december 15, 2006, after he was escorted to his cell and had his handcuffs removed, defendant rushed to the back of the cell and began punching his cellmate. defendant refused orders to stop striking his cellmate until correctional officers used pepper spray on him. the department concluded defendant had battered an inmate. defendant also had been disciplined for: refusing to go to work (october 23, 1999); possessing inmate-manufactured alcohol (july 3, 2000; july 9, 2000; august 30, 2001; october 5, 2001; 4 june 17, 2002; july 11, 2002); engaging in mutual combat (august 23, 2000); cadence calling (november 29, 2000; december 2, 2000); delaying a police officer (december 16, 2000); refusing a direct order (january 21, 2001); and disobeying a direct order (december 17, 2003). on march 1, 2013, defendant filed a petition under section 1170.126 to recall his sentence (proposition 36 petition) and impose a determina years in state prison. defendant contended, and it is not disputed, that his current conviction was not a disqualifying conviction for recall of his sentence. defendant further asserted he did not pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. the los angeles county district attorney opposed the petition, arguing that based on his post-conviction conduct, defendant was not suitable for relief. on march 19, 2015, prior to resolution of the proposition 36 petition, defendant filed a petition to recall his sentence pursuant to section 1170.18 (proposition 47 petition), and to reduce his felony conviction for possession of a controlled substance to a misdemeanor. defendant contended that in 2006, he disassociated with his prison gang and had not committed any rules violations since that time. he argued that if he were released, he would be removed to mexico, where he would be supported by his family and therefore would not return to a life of crime. the district attorney opposed the petition. on april 18, 2017, the trial court heard argument on the proposition 47 petition, finding that participation, institutional behavior, and insufficient rehabilitative programming . . . remains probative of his current the trial court further found that 5 defendant had - on october 24, 201proposition 36 petition. on november 8, 2017, the trial court denied that petition, citing the same evidence presented against . iii. discussion a. proposition 36 1. the act the three strikes reform act of 2012 (proposition 36) whose current conviction is for a felony that is neither serious nor violent. in that circumstance, unless an exception applies, the defendant is to receive a second[-]strike sentence of twice the term otherwise provided for the current felony. . . . [] . . . [] in addition to reducing the sentence to be imposed for some third[-] strike felonies that are neither violent nor serious, [proposition 36] provides a procedure by which some prisoners already serving third[-]strike sentences may seek resentencing in accordance with the new sentencing rules. ( 1170.126.) . . . in contrast to the rules that apply to sentencing, . . . the rules governing resentencing provide that an inmate will be denied rethe court, in its discretion, determines that resentencing the petitioner would pose an unreasonable r ( 1170.126, subd. (people v. johnson (2015) 61 cal.4th 674, 681-682.) 6 factors a trial court may consider in exercising its discretion under subdivision (f) of section 1170.126 include: defendantrecord and record of rehabilitation while incarcerated, and any other evidence that the trial court determines is relevant in deciding whether a new sentence would result in an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. ( 1170.126, subd. (g).) 2. proposition 36 is not unconstitutionally vague defendant argues proposition 36 is unconstitutionally vague. a statute which either forbids or requires the doing of an act in terms so vague that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application. (people v. navarro (2016) 244 cal.app.4th 1294, 1300.) we review vagueness challenges de novo. (id. at p. 1301.) following the enactment of proposition 36, courts of appeal have rejected argumentunreasonable r as used in section 1170.126, subdivision (f), is unconstitutionally vague. (see, e.g., people v. garcia (2014) 230 cal.app.4th 763, 769-770 . . . ; people v. flores (2014) 227 cal.app.4th 1070, 1075 . . . [surely a superior court judge is capable of exercising discretion, justly applying the public safety exception, and determining whether a lesser sentence would pose an unreasonable risk of harm to the public safety].)people v. valencia (2017) 3 cal.5th 347, 354-355.) defendant nonetheless in section 1170.126, subdivision (f) is a vague and ambiguous pleonasm, 7 which refers to a redundancy. (see wilson v. gentile (1992) 8 cal.app.4th 759, 764.) the destructive force of pleonasm[] lies in the fact that by modifying a word with the very essential meaning of that word, the pleonasm negates we conclude that proposition 36 is not unconstitutionally vague as a pleonasm. first, although risk and danger describe closely related concepts, they are not redundant: possibility of loss or injury,(merriam-1993) p. 1011), while (id. at p. 292.) second, even if risk and danger were redundant in the abstract, as used in section 1170.126, those terms are not vague. (see people v. navarro, supra, 244 cal.app.4th at pp. 1300-1301 [legal commands must be applied in a specific context].) proposition 36 directs the trial court to consider whether unreasonable risk of danger to public safety thus, a trial court may deny a that defendant poses an unreasonable chance of exposing the public safety to harm. next, citing sessions v. dimaya (2018) 576 u.s. ___ [138 s.ct. 1204] (dimaya), defendant contends section 1170.126, subdivision (f) is a vague residual clause because it allows the trial court to deny a proposition 36 petition based on a subjective and vague risk. we disagree. in dimaya, the united states supreme court considered title 18 united states code section 16(b) (section 16(b)), which defined under the immigration and nationality act to include 8 that, by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the dimaya, supra, 576 u.s. at p. ___ [138 s.ct. at p. 1211], italics added.) the united states supreme court, citing johnson v. united states (2015) 576 u.s. ___ [135 s.ct. 2551], explained the due process concerns posed by section 16(b): 16(b) . . . requires a court to picture the kind of conduct that the crime involves in the ordinary case, and to judge whether that some not-well-specified-yet-sufficiently-large degree of risk. [citation.] the result is that [section] 16(b) produces . . . more unpredictability and arbitrariness than the dimaya, supra, 576 u.s. at p. ___ [138 s.ct. at p. 1216].) proposition 36, however, includes no such similar reference re the trial court to abstractly consider an in order to determine whether releasing an inmate poses a sufficient level of risk. further, the united states supreme court in dimaya anticipated e: doubt the constitutionality of laws that call for the application of a qualitative standard such as substantial risk to real-world conduct; the law is full of instances where on his estimating rightly . . . some matter of degree[.](dimaya, supra, 576 u.s. at p. ___ [138 s.ct. at p. 1214].) here, the trial court determined that defendant posed an reasonable risk of danger to the real-world conduct of his prior criminal offenses and prison disciplinary record, as it was permitted to do. ( 1170.126, subds. (f) and (g).) we do not find section 1170.126, subdivision (f) to be unconstitutionally vague. 9 3. trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying proposition 36 petition defendant also contends the trial court abused its discretion in denying his proposition 36 petition. we review a under section 1170.126, subdivisions (f) and (g) for an abuse of discretion. (people v. valencia, supra, 3 cal.5th at p. 354; people v. buford (2016) 4 cal.app.5th 886, 894-895.) a trial court abuses its discretion under the applicable law and the relevant facts . . . .people v. williams (1998) 17 cal.4th 148, 162.) defendant contends the trial court abused its discretion here because the evidence was speculative that he would reoffend if released. we find no abuse of discretion. ory, commitment offense, prison disciplinary record, lack of rehabilitative programming, gang activity, and the weaknesses of his post-release plans in reaching its conclusion that defendant posed an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. defendant was cited for multiple rules violations while incarcerated, including for violent offenses. moreovercommitment offense is possession of a controlled substance, and while incarcerated, defendant had been found in possession of inmate-manufactured alcohol on six occasions. the trial court participated in rehabilitation programs. finally, the trial court found -release plans, to live a law-abiding life in mexico, unpersuasive. defendant had re-entered the country illegally after his first removal, and was then arrested for his 10 current offense. thus, the trial court concluded defendant had not provided a satisfactory plan that would reduce his risk of danger to public safety. given this evidence in the record, the trial court could conclude there was an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety if defendant was resentenced under section 1170.126. we do not find the trial courtoutside the bounds of reason. b. proposition 47 petition defendant also contends the trial court erred by denying his proposition 47 petition. approved by the voters in 2014, safe neighborhoods and ) reduced the punishment for certain theft- and drug-related offenses, making them punishable as misdemeanors rather than felonies. (people v. page under section 1170.18, subdivision (a), a person who is currently serving a sentence for a felony conviction that would have been a misdemeanor under the act may petition the court that entered s felony sentence and resentence the person as if he or she had been convicted of the misdemeanor. if the court determines that the defendant satisfies the criteria of section 1170.18, subdivision (a), the court is required to recall the felony sentence and resentence the defendanunless the court, in its discretion, determines that resentencing the petitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to ( 1170.18, subd. (b).)people v. jefferson (2016) 1 cal.app.5th 235, 239-240.) 11 unreasonable risk of danger is more limited than the definition provided by proposition 36; namely, it refers to a danger that defendant will commit a super-strike. (people v. valencia, supra, 3 cal.5th at pp. 355-356;  1170.18, subd. (c).) - a sexually violent offense (welf. & inst. code,  6600, subd. (b)), oral copulation with a child under 14 years of age ( 288a), sodomy with another person under 14 years of age ( 286), sexual penetration with another person under 14 years of age ( 289), lewd or lascivious act involving a child under 14 years of age ( 288), any homicide or attempted homicide ( 187-191.5), solicitation to commit murder ( 653f), assault with a machine gun on a peace officer or firefighter ( 245, subd. (d)(3)), possession of a weapon of mass destruction ( 11418, subd. (a)(1)), and any serious or violent felony punishable in california by life imprisonment or death. ( 667, subd. (e)(2)(c)(iv).) pursuant to section 1170.18, subdivision (c) for an abuse of discretion. (people v. hall (2016) 247 cal.app.4th 1255, 1264; accord, people v. jefferson, supra, 1 cal.app.5th at pp. 242-243.) the typical abuse of discretion standard involves an analysis of whether the trial courts decision is supported by substantial evidence, has been characterized as a [citation.] a substantial evidence inquiry examines the record in the light most favorable to the judgment and upholds it if the record contains reasonable, credible evidence of solid value upon which a reasonable trier of fact could have relied in reaching the conclusion in question. once such evidence is 12 found, the substantial evidence test is satisfied. (people v. fuiava (2012) 53 cal.4th 622, 711.)2 on this record, we do not find an abuse of discretion. like section 1170.126, section 1170.18 permits a trial court to consider record and record of rehabilitation, and other evidence deemed relevant by the trial court to decide whether there would be an unreasonable risk of the defendant committing a super-strike if resentenced. ( 1170.18, subds. (b), (c).) while defendant has not been convicted of or otherwise accused of committing a super-strike offense, the court could fairly consider his criminal history and record of prison discipline to conclude that he posed an unreasonable risk of committing murder or attempted murder. indeed, defendant had pointed a firearm at a victim while committing robbery; and while in prison, possessed dangerous or deadly contraband or weapons on three occasions and twice battered an inmate. he expressed a willingness to inflict a deadly wound when he stated that he intended to use a weapon prior use of a firearm and use of weapons while in prison support a conclusion that defendant posed an unreasonable risk of committing a -people v. jefferson, supra, 1 cal.app.5th 2 defendant argues the trial court misapplied its discretion under proposition 47, citing conclusion that to public safety, as opposed to an unreasonable risk of danger that he would commit a super-strike. in the same order, the trial court repeatedly made clear that public safetythat he would commit a super-strike. we accordingly find no error on this ground. 13 at p. a firearm and personal infliction of great bodily injury on victim, plus gang ties, demonstrated that defendant was likely to commit super-strike]; people v. hall, supra, 247 cal.app.4th at p. 1264-1265 [where a defendant expressed a willingness to use not only force but deadly force, the trial court appropriately denied petition].) we note the trial court found that membership in a prison or street gang necessarily meant that defendant was involved in the commission or attempted commission of at least some super-strikes. moreover, the trial court, in its written order, incorrectly stated that defendant had been a verified member of a gang until 2011, when the record reflects that defendant was a verified member until 2006.3 it would have been improper for the trial court to rely solely on to deny , as the voters who approved proposition 47 were specifically informed that criminal street gang members would be entitled to recall of sentence if the defendant had a qualifying conviction and there was not an unreasonable risk that the defendant would commit a super-strike if resentenced. (people v. hoffman (2015) 241 cal.app.4th 1304, 1310-1311.) but as discussed above, the trial court did not rely on this factor rather, the record includes substantial other evidence upon which the trial court people v. fuiava, supra, 53 cal.4th at p. 711.) 3 indeed, petition, the trial court accepted that defendant had not been involved in any gang activity since 2006, but noted that it was easier for defendant to stay out of trouble beginning in 2006 because he had a single cell. 14 defendant next argues that because defendant would be removed to mexico, he would not pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety, which he contends refers to the safety of the california public. according to defendant, the trial court thus erred in denying his petition. d argument is unavailing. as noted by the trial court, defendant returned to california after his first removal, and the trial court discredited his post-release rehabilitative plans. the trial court was entitled to and did express skepticism ab-release plans. finally, defendant had no record of prison discipline since 2006; but that does not necessarily mean the trial court abused its discretion by denying the petition based on conduct. (see people v. hall, supra, 247 cal.app.4th at pp. 1265-history, including threats to kill the victim during a robbery while on probation, even though defendant had no record of prison misconduct].) reasonable minds can differ without a finding of an abuse of discretion. (see people v. moya (1986) 184 which reasonable minds may differ is not a record establishing an we do not find on this record that the trial court abused its discretion in denying defeproposition 47 petition. 15 iv. disposition the orders are affirmed. not to be published in the official reports kim, j. we concur: baker, acting p.j. seigle, j. judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
