[] ough it. what do i need to show? or what needs to be shown? 5 what needs to be shown is that the defendant reasonably believed that he was in imminent danger of being killed, raped, or suffering great bodily injury. so in order for you to find self-defense at this point, deputy public defender michael pentz, representing ms. perez, requested permission to approach the the court: the court is at sidebar outside the presence of the jury with counsel. [] yes, it lightly, but what ms. lyons just said, initially, she said truthful people have the burden of proof thand she went in to begin the elements and she said what needs to be shown. [] then she said what i need to show, then she corrected, no, not what i need to show but what needs to be shown. taken all together now, at least the suggesting, that the burden is on the defense to show that the - - that they acted in self-came out is shifting the burden, and i want a curative instruction. [] the court: okay. ms. lyons was asked to respond and the following ensued: ms. lyons: i - - why i stated it as i did. in order for them to find self-defense, stated it the same way. i was very particular in making sure i court: hold on a second. [] ms. lyons, just make it clear to the - 6 -defense that you make the - - you ke the same mistake that i did with regard to the instructions which -defense to attempted murder versus self-defense to assault with a deadly weapon. [] . . . [] the court: thank you. ms. lyons continued: okay. [] as i was saying. what you have to show or has to be shown to you via the evidence for self-defense to apply is that the defendant reasonably believed that he was in imminent danger of being killed, raped, or suffering great bodily injury. that the defendant reasonably believed that the - - the use of force was necessary to defend against that danger. and that the defendant used no more force than was reasonably necessary to defend against that danger. [] you beyond a reasonable doubt that self-defense is not applicable - the jury was instructed that self-defense or defense of another is a defense to: attempted murder; attempted voluntary manslaughter; and deadly weapon assault. moreover, the jurors were instructed the burden was on the prosecution to prove defendant did not act in self-defense or defense of another. with respect to attempted murder or attempted voluntary manslaughter, the trial court instthe defendant is not guilty of attempted murder or attempted voluntary manslaughter if she was justified in attempting to kill someone in self-defense or defense of another. [] the defendant acted in lawful self-defense or defense of another if: [] . . . [] . . . the people have the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the attempted killing was not justified. if the people have not met 7 this burden, you must find the defendant not guilty of attempted murder or attempted voluntary manslaughter with respect to deadly weapon assault, the trial court instructed: with assault with a deadly weapon other than a firearm in violation of penal code section 245. [] to prove the defendant is guilty of this crime, the people must prove that: [] . . . [] and, five, the defendant did not act in self-defense or in defense of someone else., the jury was instructed: -defense is a defense to assault with a deadly weapon. the defendant is not guilty of that crime if he or she used force against the other person in lawful self-defense or defense of another. [] the defendant acted in lawful self-defense or defense of another if: [] . . . [] the people have the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant did not act in lawful self-defense or defense of another. if the people have not met this burden, you must find the defendant not guilty of assault with a as our supreme court explained in people v. hill (1998) 17 constitution when it comprises a pattern that it infects the trial with such unfairness as to make the people v. gionis (1995) 9 cal.4th 1196, 1214; people v. espinoza (1992) 3 cal.4th 806, 820.) conduct by a prosecutor that does not render a criminal trial fundamentally unfair is prosecutorial misconduct under state law only if it involves the use of deceptive or reprehensible methods people v. 8 espinoza, supra, 3 cal.4tpeople v. samayoa (1997) 15 a prosecutor has wide latitude in arguing a case to a jury. (people v. peoples (2016) 62 cal.4th 718, 792; people v. hill, supra, 17 cal.4th at p. 819.) however, a prosecutor can commit misconduct if he or she misstates the law on burden of proof. (people v. marshall (1996) 13 cal.4th 799, 831; people v. hill, supra, 17 cal.4th at p. 831; people v. gonzalez (1990) 51 cal.3d 1179, 1215.) people v. ellison (2011) 196 cal.app.4th 1342, 1353; people v. williams (2009) 170 cal.app.4th 587, 635.) the question is whether it is reasonably likely the jury applied the complained-of remark in an objectionable manner. (people v. mcdowell (2012) 54 cal.4th 395, 437; people v. samayoa, supra, 15 cal.4th at p. 841; people v. berryman (1993) 6 cal.4th 1048, 1072, disapproved on another point in people v. hill, supra, 17 cal.4th at p. 823, fn. 1.) defendant has not shown misconduct. the jury was repeatedly instructed it was the burden to show defendant did not act in self defense. ms. lyons both prefaced and concluded the quoted argument by emphasizing the burden of proving the absence of self defense rested with the prosecution. e he acted in self-defense or defense of others. there is no reasonable requiring defendant to prove he acted in self-defense. 9 b. count 2 defendant argues the trial court should have stayed the count 2 sentence under section 654, subdivision (a). however, the trial court failed to impose any sentence on count 2. the sentence is therefore legally unauthorized. (people v. alford (2010) 180 cal.app.4th 1463, 1472; people v. cheffen (1969) 2 cal.app.3d 638, 641-642.) a sentence. (people v. duff (2010) 50 cal.4th 787, 795-796; people v. alford, supra, 180 cal.app.4th at pp. 1468-1469.) thus, upon remittitur issuance, the trial court is to impose a sentence on count 2. (people v. cheffen, supra, 2 cal.app.3d at pp. 641-642; people v. taylor (1971) 15 cal.app.3d 349, 353; see people v. eberhardt (1986) 186 cal.app.3d 1112, 1121-1122 [trial court stayed imposition of sentence on enhancements].) the parties point to a minute order and an abstract of judgment, both of which reflect a concurrent three-year sentence on count 2. however, it is the oral pronouncement of judgment that controls. (people v. jones (2012) 54 cal.4th 1, 89; people v. mitchell (2001) 26 cal.4th 181, 185; people v. mesa (1975) 14 cal.3d 466, 471.) there was no oral pronouncement of judgment on count 2. after further briefing, the parties agree we must order sentencing on count 2. 10 c. assessments the trial court orally imposed a $30 court facilities assessment and a $40 court operations assessment. (gov. code,  70373, subd. (a)(1);  1465.8, subd. (a)(1).) however, because defendant was convicted of two counts, and even if count 2 is stayed, the assessments should have been in the amounts of $60 and $80 respectively. (people v. sencion (2012) 211 cal.app.4th 480, 484-485; people v. crittle (2007) 154 cal.app.4th 368, 370-371; see people v. alford (2007) 42 cal.4th 749, 758, fn. 6) .) the oral pronouncement of judgment must be modified to so provide. the abstract of judgment is correct in this regard and need not be amended. d. credit defendant was in presentence custody for 375 days from october 19, 2014 to october 28, 2015. the trial court awarded 375 days of custody credit and 375 days of conduct credit. however, under section 4019, defendant was entitled to only 374 days of conduct credit. (people v. whitaker (2015) 238 cal.app.4th 1354, 1358-1360; people v. chilelli (2014) 225 cal.app.4th 581, 588.) the judgment must be modified and the abstract of judgment amended to so provide. 11 iv. disposition the judgment of conviction is affirmed. the judgment is modified to reflect: a $60 court facilities assessment (gov. code,  70373, subd. (a)(1)); an $80 court operations assessment (pen. code,  1465.8, subd. (a)(1)); and an award of 374 dgood conduct. following remittitur issuance, defendant is to be sentenced on count 2. the superior court clerk is to then prepare an amended abstract of judgment and deliver a copy of the department of corrections and rehabilitation. not to be published in the official reports turner, p.j. we concur: baker, j. kumar, j. judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
