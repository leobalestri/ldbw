(see people v. gallow (sep. 20, 1996, b088383) [nonpub. opn.].) in 1994, a jury convicted gallow on two counts of first degree murder (pen. code,  187; counts 1 & 2)1 with robbery and multiple murder special circumstance findings ( 190.2, subds. (a)(3) & (a)(17)(i)), one count of attempted willful, deliberate, and premeditated murder ( 187, 664; count 3), and one count of first degree robbery ( 211, 212.5; count 4), with firearm use enhancements ( 12022.5, subd. (a)) as to each count. the trial court sentenced gallow to consecutive terms of life without the possibility of parole (lwop) on counts 1 and 2 ( 190.2, subd. (a)(3)), a consecutive term of life with the possibility of parole on count 3, plus three five-year terms for the firearm enhancements.2 on appeal, the judgment was modified by striking the firearm enhancements on counts 2 and 3 and, as modified, affirmed. (people v. gallow, supra, b088383.) following the enactment of section 3051 and subsequent amendments to its provisions for parole hearings for certain youthful offenders, gallow asserted a right to a parole hearing 1 all unspecified statutory references are to the penal code. 2 the record does not reflect whether the trial court sentenced gallow for the robbery or whether the court referred to the robbery special circumstance as a basis for the lwop sentences. 3 despite his lwop sentence because he had been incarcerated for over 25 years. on may 30, 2018, gallow filed a petition to require the court to hold a hearing pursuant to people v. franklin (2016) 63 cal.4th 261 (franklin) so he could present mitigating, youth-related information for possible parole. on june 12, 2018, the trial court rejected the request, as section 3051 expressly . . to cases in which an individual is sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole for a controlling offense that was committed after the person had 3051, subd. (h); see also subd. (b)(4).) gallow now appeals the denial of his request for a franklin hearing. gallow acknowledges his ineligibility for relief under section 3051 as written. he instead argues the legislatudecision to give parole hearings to offenders who committed offenses when under the age of 26, and who did not receive an lwop sentence, means his lwop sentence now constitutes cruel exclusion of individuals over 18 years of age with lwop sentences from its parole hearing provisions violates the constitutional guarantee of equal protection. discussion a. gis not cruel or unusual punishment because the pertinent facts are undisputed, we review de novo constitutional cruel or unusual punishment claim. (people v. palafox (2014) 231 cal.app.4th 68, 82-83.) 1. history underlying section 3051 while gallow was an adult when he committed the offenses at issue, to provide context we start with an overview of the 4 juvenile sentencing jurisprudence that led to the enactment of section 3051. in recent years, the united states and california supreme courts have imposed limitations on the sentences which may be imposed on juvenile offenders. in a series of cases, our diminished culpability and greater prospects for reform. (miller v. alabama (2012) 567 u.s. 460, 471 [183 l.ed.2d 407, 132 s.ct. 2455] (miller).)in re jenson (2018) 24 cal.app.5th 266, 276.) tpunishment and its state constitutional corollary have been held to prohibit lwop sentences for juveniles who commit nonhomicide offenses (graham v. florida (2010) 560 u.s. 48 [130 s.ct. 2011, 176 l.ed.2d 825] ), de facto lwop sentences for juvenile nonhomicide offenders (people v. caballero (2012) 55 cal.4th 262), and mandatory lwop sentences for juveniles in homicide cases (miller, supra, 567 u.s. 460). in response to these developments, enacted senate bill no. 260 in 2013 [effective january 1, 2014] to implement the limitations on juvenile sentencing articulated in these cases. in adopting senate bill no. 260, which added section 3051 and amended sections 3041, 3046, and 4801,[3] the 3 as amended in 2014, section 4801, subdivision (c), stated: prisoner committed his or her controlling offense, as defined in subdivision (a) of section 3051, prior to attaining 18 parole pursuant to section 3041.5, shall give great weight to the diminished culpability of juveniles as compared to adults, the hallmark features of youth, and any subsequent growth and increased maturity of the prisoner in accordance with relevant , 5 moral culpability and enhances the prospect that, as a youth matures into an adult and neurological development occurs, these eligibility mechanism that provides a person serving a sentence for crimes that he or she committed as a juvenile the opportunity to obtain release when he or she has shown that he or she has [citation.] [] to this end, section 3051 provides that an offender who committed a in re jenson, supra, 24 cal.app.5th at pp. 276-277.) hereas senate bill no. 260 made youth offender parole hearings available for juveniles who committed their controlling offense before age 18 (. . . stats. 2013, ch. 312,  5), the legislature has since amended the age threshold to age 23 (. . . stats. 2015, ch. 471,  2) and now to age 25 (. . . stats. 2017, ch. 684,  2.5, eff. jan. 1, 2018).people v. contreras (2018) 4 amendment effective january 1, 2018, raised the age of eligibility to 25 years and included lwop offenses committed before age 18. [citations.] thus, section when a prisoner committed his or her controlling offense, as defined in subdivision (a) of section 3051, when he or she was 25 suitability for parole pursuant to section 3041.5, shall give great weight to the diminished culpability of youth as compared to adults, the hallmark features of youth, and any subsequent growth and increased maturity of the prisoner in accordance with 6 determinate sentence; during his 20th year of incarceration if he received a life term of less than 25 years to life; and during his 25th year of incarceration if he received a term of 25 years to life. ( 3051, subd. (b)(1)-(3).) an offender convicted of a controlling offense committed before the age of 18 for which he was sentenced to lwop is entitled to a youth offender parole hearing during his 25th year of incarceration. ( 3051, subd. (b)(4).)in re jenson, supra, 24 cal.app.5th at p. 277.) several categories of youthful offenders are excluded from the application of section 3051, including thoselike gallowsentenced to lwop for offenses committed when they were over the age of 18. (in re jenson, supra, 24 cal.app.5th at pp. 277-278; see  3051, subd. (h).) 2. the enactment of section 3051 did not make punishment gallow acknowledges that the united states and california supreme court cases on which he relies apply only to juvenile offenders, and that he was not a juvenile at the time of his offense conduct. he also acknowledges, as he must, that his lwop sentences for first degree murder with special circumstances, committed when he was an adult, were not cruel and unusual punishment when they were imposed. he instead argues that [b]ecause the legislature has embraced the concept that certain classes of offenders who were under 26 years of age at the time of commission of the offense and received lengthy sentences should be given the possibility of parole, . . . the 7 legislature has thereby determined that youthful offenders committing offenses when they are under 26 years of age are less culpable than those committing offenses after they turn therefore, gallow claims, an lwop sentence such as the one imposed on him is now grossly disproportionate to his offense conduct, and constitutes cruel or unusual punishment. we reject this argument. it has long been established that [w]hether a particular punishment is disproportionate to the offense is, of course, a question of degree. the choice of fitting and proper penalties is not an exact science, but a legislative skill involving an appraisal of the evils to be corrected, the weighing of practical alternatives, consideration of relevant policy factors, and responsiveness to the public will; in appropriate cases, some leeway for experimentation may also be permissible. the judiciary, accordingly, should not interfere in this process unless [citations], i.e., so severe in relation to the crime as to violate the in re lynch (1972) 8 cal.3d 410, 423-424.) gallow cites no case holding that where a punishment is proportionate to the offense and does not constitute cruel or unusual punishment when imposed, it may later be rendered cruel or unusual by the subsequent enactment of legislation granting a degree of leniency to a different group of offenders. s for first degree murder with special circumstances, which were constitutional when imposed, did not become unconstitutional when the legislature enacted section 3051 or the pertinent amendments to it extending its initial reach. 8 the legislature implement the limitations on juvenile sentencing articulated inrecent cases addressing that issue. (in re jenson, supra, 24 parole eligibility mechanism that provides a person serving a sentence for crimes that he or she committed as a juvenile the opportunity to obtain release . . . id. at pp. 276-277.) gallow argues that subdivision (b)(1) through (3) of section 3051 focus on the age of the offender and his or her immaturity. gallow concludes these legislative expressions are inconsistent with denying him a youth offender parole hearing. prerogative to consider an additional factor regarding eligibility: whether a person received an lwop sentence for his or her people v. scott (2016) 3 cal.app.5th 1265, 1272.) it reflects an underlying crime of distinct seriousness. while gallow may disagree with the in section 3051, we are obligated to defer to them. (in re lynch, supra, 8 cal.3d at pp. 423-424.) to qualify as punishment under the eighth amendment, the burden or disability [at issue] must be imposed as a consequence of a law violation, and must either be intended as punishment, or have no other legitimate aimin re alva (2004) 33 cal.4th 254, 282.) precluding gallow from obtaining a parole hearing when he was sentenced to consecutive lwop terms did not impose any additional burden or disability on gallow. accordingly, punishment by virtue of the legislature granting parole hearings 9 to those with less serious offenses, or who committed their controlling lwop offense as a juvenile. b. no equal protection violation occurred gallow also asserts section 3051, subdivisions (b)(4) and (h), violate his equal protection rights to a franklin evidentiary preservation hearing and a later parole hearing.4 he argues he is similarly situated to juveniles who committed controlling offenses and received lwop sentences, and who are thus entitled to a the distinction that he was 25 [years old] when he committed the offenses in this case has been found in effect by the legislature in . . . section [3051] not to prevent other defendants who committed serious crimes from eventually having a parole we review such an equal protection claim de novo. (people v. laird (2018) 27 cal.app.5th 458, 469.) 1. is subject to rational basis review us claim under the equal protection clause is a showing that the state has adopted a classification that affects two or more similarly situated groups in whether persons are similarly situated for all purposes, but [citations.]people v. morales (2016) 63 cal.4th 399, 408, italics omitted.) 4 in his petition, gallow complained his sentence was cruel and unusual, but made no separate equal protection claim. because his equal protection claim is closely related to his cruel and unusual punishment claim, we assume without deciding that gallow did not forfeit his equal protection claim by failing to raise it below. 10 if a class of criminal defendants is in fact similarly situated to another class of defendants who are sentenced differently, we look to determine whether there is a rational basis for the onship between the disparity of treatment and some legitimate governmental depend upon whether lawmakers ever actually articulated the purpose they sought to achieve. nor must the underlying rationale be empirically substantiated. [citation.] while the realities of the subject matter cannot be completely ignored as to the justifications for the legislative choice [citation]. it is immaterial people v. edwards (2019) 34 cal.app.5th 183, 195 (edwards).) to successfully challenge a law on equal protection grounds, the defendant must negate every conceivable the disputed statutory disparitymight be supported. (edwards, supra, 34 cal.app.5th at p. 195.) if a analysis does not entitle the judiciary to second-guess the id. at pp. 195-196.) 2. section 3051 does not provide relief to defendants who committed more serious offenses because he has not demonstrated the state has adopted a classification that affects two or more similarly situated groups in an unequal manner. 11 criminal sentencing has long distinguished between someone like gallow, who was 25 years old at the time of his controlling offense, and juveniles. (e.g., people v. gutierrez (2014) 58 cal.4th [citation], and that is the line the [united states supreme court] the law has also long distinguished between lwop and lesser sentences. accordingly, the relevant group of which gallow is a member for purposes of equal protection analysis is the group of persons who, as adults over the age of 18 but under the age of 26, committed a controlling offense resulting in an lwop sentence. none of the persons described in section 3051, subdivision (b)(1) through (3), fall within that group, including persons who committed serious offenses as adults. therefore, gallow is not similarly situated with respect to those persons. edwards, on which gallow relies, does not compel a contrary conclusion. it held that the portion of section 3051, subdivision (h), which denies relief to defendants who have received one strike law sentences for sexual offenses, violates those defendants equal protection rights. edwards reached that conclusion because section 3051 relief is available to persons who have committed the more serious offense of intentional first degree murder. (edwards, supra, 34 cal.app.5th at pp. 192, 194-197, 199.) unlike the defendant in edwards, gallow cannot point to any more serious offense for which section 3051 provides relief. as edwards distinguished between such murders and other crimes against 12 persons, reserving the most draconian sentences for murderers edwards, supra, 34 cal.app.5th he parties point to no other provision of our penal code, and we are aware of none, that treats a nonhomicide offense more harshly than special circumstance murder.people v. contreras, supra, 4 cal.5th at p. 382.) as there is no crime more serious than the special circumstance murders committed by gallow, much less one for which section 3051 permits relief, edwards provides no disposition the order is affirmed. not to be published weingart, j.* we concur: rothschild, p. j. johnson, j. * judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
