[] it would be preferable to have him out of custody to at least attempt to earn and pay back this sum rather than shuttle him off to state prison. the trial court stated: well, thats what i thought originally, and thats why i gave him a chance on probation. hes just basically [flouted] the chance, could care less. [] here is somebody who [takes] advantage of an elderly person, refinancing her home three times and stealing all of her money, writing forged checks . . . for almost a hundred thousand dollars. . . . [] its outrageous. ive asked [haile] where is the money, and [he] has never been able to tell me where the money is. i dont know if hes hiding it, i dont know if he used it, but what i do know is he destroyed somebody. he just destroyed somebody. and this court thought it would be in everybodys interest to give him an opportunity on probation, and then he just thumbed his nose at the court and everybody else and barely paid anything back to this poor victim, this elderly person. [] hes not going to do anything, hes shown his stripes, and the court finds him to be in violation of probation. probation is revoked. haile was sentenced to three years in state prison. this timely appeal followed. discussion a trial court may revoke and terminate such probation if the interests of justice so require and the court, in its judgment, has reason to believe from the report of the probation officer or otherwise that the person has violated any of the conditions of his or 4her probation. . . . however, probation shall not be revoked for failure of a person to make restitution . . . unless the court determines that the defendant has willfully failed to pay and has the ability to pay. restitution shall be consistent with a persons ability to pay. (pen. code,  1203.2, subd. (a).) we review the revocation of probation for an abuse of discretion. (people v. rodriguez (1990) 51 cal.3d 437, 443.) according to haile, the trial court abused its discretion because there was no evidence that he had the ability to pay restitution and his failure to pay was willful. he is correct that the evidence did not support revocation of probation based on his failure to make restitution payments. but there was no abuse of discretion. we review the trial courts ruling and not its reasoning. [citations.] (people v. mason (1991) 52 cal.3d 909, 944.) a ruling that is correct will not be disturbed on appeal merely because given for a wrong reason. if right upon any theory of the law applicable to the case, it must be sustained regardless of the considerations which may have moved the trial court to its conclusion. [citation.] (damico v. board of medical examiners (1974) 11 cal.3d 1, 19.) the ruling was supported by evidence that haile failed to keep three appointments with cheng and update the phone number that he had provided to the probation department. before revoking probation, a trial court must find that a violation was willful. (people v. cervantes (2009) 175 cal.app.4th 291, 295.) here, there is evidence of willful violations. chao testified: [haile] failed to show up april 7th, june 23rd, august 13th [for appointments with cheng]. these are the three appointments we instructed him to report to. thus, haile did not obey an order of the probation department and violated a term of probation. moreover, chao and cheng testified that when they called hailes phone, it was out of service. according to chao, a person on active felony probation has the responsibility for [the probation department] to be able to get in touch with them at all times. this testimony gives rise to the inference that haile willfully violated an order or regulation of the probation department to provide a current phone number. though these violations are technical, they are sufficient to support the revocation of probation. (people v. dixon (2003) 113 cal.app.4th 146, 152 5[probation revoked because the defendant did not report by mail to his probation officer].) disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. ______________________________, j. ashmann-gerst we concur: _______________________________, acting p. j. doi todd _______________________________, j. chavez
