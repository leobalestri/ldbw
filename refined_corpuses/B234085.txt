(see, e.g., people v. brown (2011) 192 cal.app.4th of prior incidents of domestic violence is outweighed by the probability the evidence will be disturbed on appeal except upon a showing that it was exercised in an arbitrary, accordingly, we do not consider that issue. 8 2. bronson has forfeited his objection to evidence of other uncharged incidents of domestic violence by failing to identify and object to them at trial and has not demonstrated the failure to object was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel bronson argues several incidents of uncharged domestic violence were admitted into evidence that were not considered at the evidence code section 402 hearing. because bronson did not make this objection at trial, it has been forfeited. (people v. partida (2005) 37 cal.4th 428, 434; people v. romero (2008) 44 cal.4th 386, 411 to escape the forfeiture doctrine, bronson contends his counsel was constitutionally ineffective in failing to object to this evidence of prior uncharged incidents of domestic violence. either the federal or state guarantee, a defendant must show that counselfell below an objective standard of reasonableness under prevailing professional norms, d have been more see in re roberts (2003) 29 cal.4th 726, 744-745; strickland v. washington (1984) 466 u.s. 668, 694 [104 s.ct. 2052, 80 l.ed.2d 674] [same].) bronson fails to identify any specific testimony he asserts his trial counsel should have challenged. because this failure prevents us from meaningfully reviewing the contention, we do not consider it. (see mansell v. board of administration (1994) 30 cal.app.4th 539, 545 [failure to cite to the record as required by cal. rules of court, rule 8.204(a)(1)(c), makes the job of the reviewing court unduly burdensome; appellate paterno v. state of california (1999) 74 cal.app.4th 68, 9 6 moreover, as is often the case, the record is silent as to the f the proffered testimony, thus people v. mendoza tello (1997) 15 cal.4th 264, 266 [because record is often silent as to could be a plethora of possible tactical reasons, ineffective assistance of counsel claims are generally more appropriately litigated in habeas corpus proceedings where matters outside the four concerns of the record may be considered].) 3. the court did not err in instructing the jury with calcrim no. 207 the trial court instructed the jury, in accordance with calcrim no. 207, the required to prove that the crimes took place exactly on those days but only that they 7 bronson contends the court erred in giving this instruction as to counts 1 through 5 because there was no dispute as to the precise date each of those offense were alleged to have occurredoctober 24, 2010 (counts 1, 2 and 3), may 26, 2009 (count 4) and january 27, 2009 (count 5)and the error was prejudicial because it unconstitutionally permitted the jury to find bronson guilty of an uncharged offense. he also claims the instruction was particularly inappropriate for the 6 following his statement that many additional incidents of uncharged domestic violence were admitted into evidence without objection, bronson cites generally to pages hooks that she began dating bronson in 2006 and he had beco2007. no specific instances of domestic violence are mentioned. 7 cohabitant, vandalism over $400 and [making] criminal threats, as charged in counts 1, 2 and 3, consecutively, occurred on or about october 24, 2010; that the crime of first degree burglary, person present, as charged in count 4, occurred on or about may 26, 2009; that the crime of assault by means likely to produce great bodily injury, as charged in count 5, occurred on or about january 27, 2009. . . . the people are not required to prove that the crimes took place exactly on those days but only that they happened 10 october 24, 2010 offenses (counts 1 through 3) because he presented an alibi (his testimony that he was at a nightclub) for that date.8 ordinarily, the people need not plead the exact time of commission of an alleged occurred on a particular day to the exclusion of other dates, and when the defense is alibi (or lack of opportunity), it is improper to give the jury an people v. jennings (1991) 53 cal.3d 334, 359; accord, people v. richardson (2008) 43 cal.4th 959, 1027 (richardson).) when the defense is one of alibi richardson, at p. 1027; accord, people v. barney (1983) 143 cal.app.3d 490, 497.) the instruction may also be improper when there are numerous, similar uncharged offenses that occurred within the same time period. (people v. gavin (1971) 21 cal.app.3d 408, 418-conduct on october 24, and instruction permitted conviction on a similar, uncharged offense on september 26].) 8 the people urge us not to consider the contention because bronson did not object to the instruction at trial and thus has forfeited it. we have repeatedly rejected this forfeiture argument, which appears to have been made more reflexively than reflectively. we review any claim of whether or not trial counsel objected. ( any instruction given . . . even though no objection was made thereto in the lower court, if the substpeople v. hudson (2006) 38 cal.4th 1002, 1011-1012; people v. smithey (1999) 20 cal.4th 936, 976, fn. 7.) determined by deciding if the instruction as given was flawed and, if so, whether the error must necessarily review the merits of his contention there was instructional error. 11 people v. richardson, supra, 43 cal.4th at p. are intelligent persons and capable of understanding and correlating all jury instructions ibid.) here, considering the state of the evidence and the instructions as a whole, we find no reasonable likelihood of an impermissible application of calcrim no. 207. the jury was instructed in accordance with calcrim no. 852 that the uncharged incidents of domestic violence in this case occurred on or about february 16, 2008, june 20, 2008 and february 25, 2011, nowhere near the dates alleged for counts 1 through 5. thus, it is not reasonably likely the jury convicted bronson based on the facts of the uncharged offenses. similarly, it is not reasonably likely the instruction deflected supported only by his own testimony that he was at a club the night hooks claimed he was sufficient temporal ambiguity in the evidence to justify the instruction as to counts 1 through 3september 26, 2010nt, during closing argument the prosecutor expressly identified october 24, 2010 as the date the (see richardson, supra, during argument of a specific time period . . . did not render the instruction erroneous so much as 12 4. not mislead the jury section 422 makes it a crime, under specific circumstances, to threaten another person with a criminal act that will result in death or great bodily injury to the person to 9 the trial court instructed the jury in accordance with calcrim no. 1300 on the offenses of made a criminal threat in violation of penal code section 422. [] to prove that the defendant is guilty of this crime, the people must prove that: [] 1. the defendant willfully threatened to unlawfully kill or unlawfully cause great bodily injury to christyl h. in counts 3 & 7 and valery coleman in count 8; [] 2. the defendant made the threat orally; [] 3. the defendant intended that his statement be understood as a threat; [] 4. the threat was so clear, immediate, unconditional, and specific that it communicated to christyl h. and to valery coleman a serious intention and the immediate prospect that the threat would be carried out; [] 5. the threat actually caused christyl h. and valery coleman to be in sustained fear for her own safety or for the safety of her immediate family; and [] 6. was reasonable under bronson contends the instruction was confusing because, without separately identifying which of the two women was the victim in each count, that is, the person to whom the threat was communicated, the instruction unlawfully permitted the jury to 9 any person who willfully threatens to commit a crime which will result in death or great bodily injury to another person, with the specific intent that the statement, made verbally, in writing, or by means of an electronic communication device, is to be taken as a threat, even if there is no intent of actually carrying it out, which, on its face and under the circumstances in which it is made, is so unequivocal, unconditional, immediate, and specific as to convey to the person threatened, a gravity of purpose and an immediate prospect of execution of the threat, and thereby causes that person reasonably to be in sustained fear for his or her y imprisonment in the county jail not to exceed one year, or by imprisonment in the state 13 convict bronson of making a criminal threat directly to hooks rather than to coleman in count 7.10 while the instruction might be susceptible to the interpretation bronson advances if considered in isolation, jury instructions must be considered in light of the entire record to determine whether it is reasonably likely the jury was misled. (people v. cross (2008) 45 cal.4th 58, 67-68; people v. hernandez (2010) 183 cal.app.4th 1327, 1332.) here, when considered in light of the entire record, it is not reasonably likely the jury would have interpreted the instruction in the manner bronson suggests. the evidence in support of count 7, which was highlighted by the prosecutor during closing argument, was that bronson made the threat to coleman after hooks had left the scene. car that was blocking him from following hooks. this is not a case, therefore, where the evidence relating to count 7 allowed for two possible victims. in any event, the verdict forms provided to the jury specifically identified the particular victim for each count, thus making absolutely clear that hooks was the victim in count 3 while coleman was the victim in count 7. there was no instructional error. (see people v. hughes (2002) 27 cal.4th 287, 377 [court evaluated instructions read together with verdict form to reject 11 5. late section 654 section 654 prohibits punishment for two or more offenses arising from the same act or from a series of acts constituting an indivisible course of conduct. (people v. lewis (2008) 43 cal.4th 415, 419; people v. latimer (1993) 5 cal.4th 1203, 1216.)12 whether a 10 for the reasons stated in footnote 8, aboveargument has been forfeited for lack of objection at trial. 11 of course, by telling the jury that bronson was accused in count 7 of willfully threatening to cause great bodily injury to hooks, the instruction properly informed the jury that the offense of making criminal threats can be committed by threatening violence to 12 different ways by different provisions of law shall be punished under the provision that provides for the longest potential term of imprisonment, but in no case shall the act or 14 course of criminal conduct is divisible and therefore gives rise to more than one act within the meaning of section 654 depends of the intent and objective of the actor. if all of the offenses were incident to one objective, the defendant may be punished for any one of the offenses but not more than one. (people v. correa (2012) 54 cal.4th 331, 336.) generally, the trial court has broad discretion in determining whether a defendant had multiple criminal objectives independent of, and not merely incidental to, each other finding a defendant held multiple criminal objectives if it is supported by substantial evidence. (people v. osband (1996) 13 cal.4th 622, 730-731; people v. blake (1998) 68 cal.app.4th 509, 512.) bronson contends his sentences on counts 1 (corporal injury to a former cohabitant), 2 (vandalism) and 3 (making criminal threats) should have been stayed under section 654 because each of those offenses, committed on october 24, 2010, was part of the same course of conduct that comprised the stalking offense in count 6. the record in m and corporal injury to a former cohabitant (counts 1 and 2) are wholly separate from the stalking offense with independent objectives and separate intentions. plainly, one need not inflict physical harm on another person or damage her property to stalk a victim. (see people v. ewing (1999) 76 cal.app.4th 199, 210 [elements of stalking are the (1) willful, malicious and repeated harassment of another person and (2) making a credible threat (3) with the intent to place that person in reasonable fear for his or her safety or the safety of his or her immediate family];  646.9.) threat made directly to hooks. that threat, in count 3, in which bronson told hooks as omission be punished under more than one provision. an acquittal or conviction and 15 immediately frighten her. the stalking offense, in contrast, was comprised of a series of repeated acts over a lengthy period of time, some immediately threatening, some not, intended to engender a prolonged state of fear and intimidation. (see people v. franz (2001) 88 cal.app.4th 1426, 1440 [unlike a threat defined by  422, a threat for purposes of stalking statute does not require any communication; stalking as defined in  646.9 may be implied by a prolonged pattern of conduct designed to intimidate]; see generally people v. ewing, supra, 76 cal.app.4th at p. 210.) bronson alternatively argues the sentence on counts 2 and 3 should be stayed because the acts charged were all part of an indivisible course of action that supported his corporal injury conviction. this contention also lacks merit. vandalism does not share an objective or intent with either corporal injury or making criminal threats, and the sentence for that offense was not subject to a stay under section 654. under some circumstances, where the threat was made at the same time and as part of the infliction of the corporal injury, those two offenses may be sufficiently interconnected that a stay of the sentence for making a criminal threat is mandated by section 654. (cf. people v. hamlin (2009) 170 cal.app.4th 1412, 1425 [defendant sentenced to indeterminate life term for torture; sentences for making a criminal threat and inflicting corporal injury on a spouse stayed pursuant to  654].) here, however, bronson injured hooks when he dragged her as she tried to hold on to a gate to protect herself from him. he did not make the criminal threat until after hooks broke free of his grasp, got in her car and attempted distinct objectives when he inflicted corporal injury on hooks and made a criminal threat. 16 disposition the judgment is affirmed. perluss, p. j. we concur: zelon, j. jackson, j.
