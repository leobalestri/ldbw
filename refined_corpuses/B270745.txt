(pen. code,  4502, subd. (a).)1 manazanares contends he was not armed during the commission of his offense and therefore is not barred from relief under proposition 36. we affirm. factual and procedural background manazanares manazanares removed a seven-inch, sharpened metal shank wrapped in cloth from his rectal area and discarded it at the feet of the deputies. manazanares was convicted of custodial possession of a sentenced to a term of 25 years to life in state prison. ( 667, 1170.12.) on march 7, 2016, manazanares filed a petition to recall his sentence under the three strikes reform act of 2012, added by proposition 36 and approved by the voters on november 6, 2012, which permits an inmate serving an indeterminate life sentence under the three strikes law for a nonviolent, nonserious felony to seek a new, lesser sentence unless resentencing would pose an unreasonable risk to public safety. ( 1170.126, subds. (b), (e), (f).) the people opposed the petition, arguing manazanares was ineligible for relief because he was armed with a deadly weapon during the commission of his possession offense. ( 1170.126, 4502, subd.

( 1170.126, subd. (e)(2); people v. hicks (2014) 231 cal.app.4th 275, 282.)2 among the offenses described in subdivision (e)(2)(c) of arm 3 here, based upon officer testimony, the trial court found that manazanares had been armed with a deadly weapon during the commission of his current offense. manazanares argues that having been armed during the commission of his offense (custodial possession of a deadly weapon) does not disqualify him from resentencing under proposition 36 because being armed is an element of the offense. therefore, he argues, the deadly another offense. the argument is without merdefendant convicted of possession of a [deadly weapon] was armed with the [deadly weapon] during the commission of the offense, the armed with a [deadly weapon] 2 subdivision (e)(2) of section 1170.126 provides in pertinent part that an inmate is eligible for resentencing if the inmates current sentence was not imposed for any of the offenses appearing in clauses (i) to (iii), inclusive, of subparagraph (c) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (e) of section 1170.12 3 subdivision (e)(2)(c)(iii) of section 667 disqualifies a defendant from relief uring the commission of the current offense, the defendant used a firearm, was armed with a firearm or deadly weapon, or intended to cause great bodily injury to another person. 4 36.
