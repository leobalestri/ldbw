(pen. code,  1170.126.)1 he contends the trial court erred in finding he was armed with a deadly weapon during the commission of his current offense and therefore ineligible for resentencing. based on our review of the record of the current conviction before us, we reject his contention and affirm the order. background on october 18, 1999, a jury found montano guilty of possessing a weapon in prison. ( 4502, subd. (a).)2 the trial court found prior conviction allegations to be true and sentenced montano to life in prison as a third strike offender. ( 667, subds. (b)-(1), 1170.12, subds. (a)-(d).) conviction, setting forth the following description of the offense in state prison inmate. during a prison-cell, which he shared with another inmate. a shelf assigned to defendant held a jewelry box. an officer opened the box, found nd determined the box had a false bottom, from which the officer extracted a stabbing weapon miranda people v. montano (oct. 27, 2000, b138480) [nonpub. opn.], p. 2.) 1 further statutory references are to the penal code. 2 the first jury deadlocked. 3 on january 8, 2013, after proposition 36 was approved by voters in november 2012, montano filed a petition to recall his sentence under section 1170.126. this statute permits an inmate serving an indeterminate life sentence under the three strikes law for a nonviolent, nonserious felony to seek a new, lesser sentence, unless resentencing would pose an unreasonable risk to public safety. ( 1170.126, subds. (b), (e) & (f).)3 the trial court ordered the district attorney to show cause why the court sentence. the district attorney filed an opposition and a supplemental opposition arguing montano was ineligible for resentencing under section 1170.126 because he was armed with a deadly weapon (a shank) during the commission of the current commitment offense (possession of a weapon in prison).4 the district attorney also argued, even if montano were eligible for resentencing, he was not suitable under section 1170.126 because resentencing 3 as stated in section 1170.126, subdivision (b), violent felonies are those offenses listed in section 667.5, subdivision (c), and serious felonies are those offenses listed in section 1192.7, weapon in prison under section 4502, subdivision (a), is not enumerated as either a violent or serious felony. 4 under section 1170.126, subdivision (e)(2), an inmate is current offense, the defendant used a firearm, was armed with a firearm or deadly weapon, or intended to cause great bodily within the meaning of section 1170.12, subdivision (c)(2)(c)(iii). (italics added.) the prosecution bears the burden of proving a petitioner is ineligible for resentencing under this criterion. (people v. frierson (2017) 4 cal.5th 225 [226 cal.rptr.3d 582, 583, 586, 407 p.3d 423, 424, 427].) 4 isk of danger to public disciplinary record and record of rehabilitation. ( 1170.126, subds.

(people v. frierson, supra, 4 cal.5th at p. ___ [226 cal.rptr.3d 582, 583, 407 p.3d 423, 424].) 6 in his opening appellate brief, montano asserted a trial opening brief in this matter, our supreme court issued its opinion in people v. estrada (2017) 3 cal.5th 661 (estrada), clarifying that a court reviewing a recall petition may consider id. at p. 671.) t that predates proposition 36 may at times fail to imply anything about disqualifying conduct, even if the evidence available to the prosecution could have supported such a finding. for this reason, we think it unlikely gn to prevent courts reviewing a recall petition from considering conduct beyond that implied by between violent and nonviolent criminal conduct, it seems implausible that the act is best understood to condition ineligibility on an indicator of violence that the prosecution had no incentive to incorporate into the judgment. accordingly, section 1170.12, subdivision (c)(2)(c)(iii) would be substantially underinclusive were we to interpret it to apply only to cases in id. at pp. 671-672.) possessed the weapon does not mean the trial court reviewing his recall petition could not find that he was armed with the weapon during commission of the current offense, based on facts transcript from the trial and the appellate opinion affirming his conviction. (estrada, supra, 3 cal.5th at pp. 675-676.) as 7 estrada d]uring occurs throughout the duration of an event or at some point in its course. [citation.] the term implies, at a minimum, a need for a temporal connection between the excluding conduct and the id. at p. 670.) montano correctly states that facts showing constructive possession of a deadly weapon, without more, are not sufficient to establish a defendant was armed with the weapon for purposes of armed if the defendant has the specified weapon available for use, either people v. bland (1995) 10 cal.4th 991, 997; people v. blakely (2014) 225 cal.app.4th 1042, 1051 judicially construed to mean having a firearm available for use, without it being available only he lives) is searched and a firearm is found next to his bed. the parolee is in possession of the firearm, because it is under his dominion and control. if he is not home at the time, however, he is not armed with the firearm, because it is not readily available to him for offensive or defensive use. accordingly, possessing a firearm does not necessarily constitute being armed with a people v. osuna (2014) 225 cal.app.4th 1020, 1030 (osuna), disapproved on another ground in people v. frierson, supra, 4 cal.5th at p. ___, fn. 8 [226 cal.rptr.3d 582, 591, 407 p.3d 423, 431].) 8 in cases decided since osuna, appellate courts have concluded a petitioner is armed with a weapon within the not carried on his person, when he is aware it is hidden in a place people v. white (2016) 243 cal.app.4th 1354, 1358, 1362 [affirming denial of petition to recall sentence on the ground petitioner was armed during commission of the possession offense where police found him in a motel corridor near a trash can containing a firearm, and evidence indicated he knew the weapon was there].) for example, in people v. elder (2014) 227 cal.app.4th 1308, a defendant was convicted of possession of a firearm by a felon after officers executed a search warrant at an apartment centid. at p. 1317.) when the defendant later filed a petition to recall his sentence under section 1170.126, the trial court found he was armed with a firearm during commission of the possession offense, and therefore ineligible for resentencing, even though the record of the conviction demonstrated he was outside the front door of the apartment (without a firearm) when the officers arrived to execute the search warrant. the court of appeal affirmed teither actually possessed the guns or at least had dominion and control over them, under conditions in which the guns were readily ibid.) similarly, in people v. hicks (2014) 231 cal.app.4th 275, to recall an indeterminate sentence for possession of a firearm by 9 a felon where parole agents encountered the defendant outside the front gate of an apartment complex with narcotics and bullets on his person, and then recovered a backpack containing a loaded firearm from inside the apartment he had just visited. (id. at pp. 279-280, 287.) evidence presented at trial demonstrated the defendant had earlier brought the backpack into the apartment. (id. at pp. 280-281.) the appellate court concluded sufficient doubt that defendant was personally armed with the firearm he id. at p. 284.) finding beyond a reasonable doubt that montano was armed with the shank during commission of the current offense of possessing people v. hicks, supra, 231 cal.app.4th at p. 284.) the record of the conviction demonstrates montano had in his jewelry box, on his assigned shelf, in his cell, a shank that he admitted belonged to him. the shank was readily accessible to him during the time he possessed it, while he was in his cell.7 as the cases discussed above establish, the record of the conviction need not show the defendant was holding the weapon at the time the weapon was found, or even within reaching distance of the weapon, to support 7 in his opening appellate brief, montano asserts the shank the record of the current conviction does not indicate it would have been difficult for montano to access the shank from the (people v. montano, supra, b138480, p. 2.) 10 a finding he was armed during the commission of the possession offense. recall his sentence because sufficient evidence in the record of the current conviction demonstrates montano was armed during commission of the current offense and therefore ineligible for resentencing under section 1170.126. disposition the order is affirmed. not to be published. chaney, j. we concur: rothschild, p. j. johnson, j.
