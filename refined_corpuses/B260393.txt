( 1192.7, subd. (c)(37).) people v. johnson (2015) 61 cal.4th 674 (johnson), we necessarily affirm. background defendant was convicted of first degree burglary and dissuading a witness in violation of section 136.1, subd. (c)(1). defendant waived a jury trial on five strike allegations (four residential burglaries and a robbery), and the court found these allegations true. the court sentenced defendant to concurrent third-strike terms of 25 years to life, plus 15 years on each count for three section 667, subdivision (a)(1) prior serious felony enhancements. in 2014 defendant filed a petition for proposition 36 resentencing with respect to his dissuading conviction. the trial court denied the petition on the ground defendants first degree burglary conviction rendered him ineligible for resentencing. discussion proposition 36, also known as the three strikes reform act of 2012, was approved by the voters on november 6, 2012, and went into effect the next day. it amended sections 667 and 1170.12 so that an indeterminate term of 25 years to life in prison is applied only where the third strike offense is a serious or violent felony or the 1 undesignated statutory references pertain to the penal code. 3 prosecution pleads and proves an enumerated triggering factor.

( 1170.126, subd. (e).) resentencing of qualified inmates may nonetheless be refused if the trial court, in its discretion, determines that resentencing the petitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. ( 1170.126, subd. (f).) on appeal defendant contends that the status of a commitment offense as serious or violent must be assessed as of the time that offense was committed and that an inmate is eligible for proposition 36 resentencing with respect to a commitment offense that is neither serious or violent, even though he or she has another commitment offense that is a serious or violent offense. in johnson, supra, 61 cal.4th at page 680, the supreme court resolved both of these issues: [w]e hold that when a court resentences a third-strike defendant the classification of an offense as serious or violent is based on the law as of november 7, 2012, the effective date of proposition 36, and that the presence of a current offense that is serious or violent does not disqualify an inmate from resentencing with respect to a current offense that is neither serious nor violent. felonies on the effective date of proposition 36 ( 1192.7, subd. (c)(18), (37)), he was ineligible for resentencing under section 1170.126. the trial court did not err by denying his petition. 4 disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published. lui, j. we concur: rothschild, p. j. chaney, j.
