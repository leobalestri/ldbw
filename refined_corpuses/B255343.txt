(a)) and two counts of possession of a firearm by a felon (former  12021, subd. (a)(1)) and found true special allegations regarding firearm use ( 12022.53, subds. (b), (d)). the trial court sentenced woods to an aggregate state prison term of 53 years, eight months to life: an indeterminate term of 25 years to life for first degree murder, plus an indeterminate term of 25 years to life for the firearm-use enhancement, plus a determinate term of three years (the upper term) for possession of a firearm by a felon, plus a determinate term of eight months (one third the two-year middle term) for possession of a firearm by a felon. the trial court stayed sentence on the two other firearm enhancements. included among the statutory fines, fees and assessments imposed by the court was a $10,000 restitution fine, $7,500 in restitution to the victim restitution board and $357.15 woods appealed, challenging his murder conviction on the grounds of instructional error and requesting that we review the in camera proceedings conducted by the trial court pursuant to his motion for production of documents under pitchess v. superior court (1974) 11 cal.3d 531 (pitchess). this court rejected instructional error, but conditionally reversed the judgment and remanded for a new pitchess hearing. (people v. woods (oct. 21, 2013, b241041) [nonpub. opn.]). following further proceedings on remand, the trial court reinstated the prior judgment. representing himself, w on february 14, 2014, claiming the trial ion fine for the amount of $17,857.15 without notice or a hearing on the ability to pay. we appointed counsel to represent woods on appeal. after examination of the record counsel filed an opening brief in which no issues were raised. on july 29, 2014, we advised woods he had 30 days within which to personally submit any contentions or issues he wished us to consider. we have received no response. we have examined the entire record and are satisfied appellate attorney has complied fully with the responsibilities of counsel. no arguable issues exist. 3 (smith v. robbins (2000) 528 u.s. 259, 277-284 [120 s.ct. 746, 145 l.ed.2d 756]; people v. kelly (2006) 40 cal.4th 106, 112-113; people v. wende (1979) 25 cal.3d 436, 441.) in every case where a person is convicted of a crime, the court shall impose a separate and additional restitution fine, unless it finds compelling and extraordinary (pen. code,  1202.4, subd. (b).) when the crime is a felony, the fine shall be set at between $200 and $10,000, commensurate with the seriousness of the offense. (pen. code,  1202.4, subd. (b)(1).) woods was convicted of first degree murder; the seriousness of the offense supported the maximum fine of $10,000. extraordinary reason not to impose the fine, but it shall be considered among other factors in setting the amount of the fine in excess of the $200 minimum. (pen. code,  1202.4, subds. (c), (d).) the statute presumes the individual has the ability to pay the fine. (people v. romero (1996) 43 cal.app.4th 440, 448-449.) (pen. code,  1202.4, subd. (d).) 1202.4, subd. (d); see people v. mcmahan (1992) 3 cal.app.4th 740, 749 [where statute mandates a fine but requires trial defendant to object or demand a hearing on ability to pay].) woods has forfeited a challenge to the restitution fine for the following reasons: first, he neither objected to the amount of the fine nor requested a hearing to determine his ability to pay at the time of sentencing. (people v. nelson (2011) 51 cal.4th 198, 227.) second, as a term of the original judgment, the restitution fine should have been where a judgment has been appealed, the defendants failure to timely raise the issue precludes his or her belated attempt to appeal from an order denying modification. to hold otherwise would condone extending the jurisdictional time limit for filing appeals through the bootstrapping vehicle of a post judgment motion to modify. (see people v. djekich (1991) 229 cal.app.3d 1213, 1219.) 4 disposition the order is affirmed. zelon, j. we concur: perluss, p. j. segal, j.* * judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
