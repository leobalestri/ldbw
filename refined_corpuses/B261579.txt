(voter information guide, supra, text of prop. 47,  3, p. 70.)people v. shabazz (2015) 237 cal.app.4th 303, 308.) 3 we affirm the order denying relief under proposition 47. defendant has failed to demonstrate his eligibility for proposition 47 relief. it is incumbent on defendant, in the first instance, to make a prima facie showing that the value of the automobile he took did not exceed $950. in the absence of this requisite showing, any error by the trial court in determining its value exceeded $950 is inconsequential. background in los angeles superior court case no. ta088032, defendant was charged in count 1 of a complaint with grand theft auto ( 487, subd.

[further, u]pon an examination of the minute orders, it does not appear that the trial judge made any explicit factual finding to which [defendant] assented. [defendant therefore] is entitled to have his felony conviction reduced t on january 12, 2015, at the hearing, the value of the automobile defendant unlawfully took was the sole disputed issue. the trial court stated the burden fell on 4 defendant to establish he was eligible for relief under proposition 47. based on review of the record of conviction, particularly the charging document, and the probation report, the trial court tentatively found the vehicle was an operational eight-year-old 1998 crown be greater than $950. the prosecution argued the value of this automobile exceeded $950, because the charging document identified the make and model of the car and according to the edmunds.com website, dealer trade-in value was $3,268, based on its highest possible mileage and worst possible condition. defendant argued the trial court was confined to the record of conviction and was prohibited from considering such extrinsic evidence and that the probation report was inadmissible. the trial court disagreed and stated it could consider anything in the record as well as based on such evidence and the inferences drawn, the trial court found the value of the taken automobile was over $950. the court acknowledged that if its finding were nfer the value of the vehicle. preceding this hearing, the trial court revconclusion of the hearing, defendant to appear at the probation violation hearing on january 26, 2015. discussion 1. petition for recall and resentencing appropriate procedure we begin by pointing out defendant has not yet completed his sentence.3 the that on january 30, 2015, defendant admitted a probation violation. the trial court revoked his probation and reinstated probation on the same 3 we invited the parties to file supplemental briefing on whether defendant has completed service of his sentence and, if not, whether the appropriate procedural challenge should be by means of a petition to recall his felony sentence and to resentence as a misdemeanor. we have received their responses. 5 terms and conditions. . . . application before the trial court . . . to have the felony conviction . . . designated as [a] misdemeanor[] 1170.18, subd.
