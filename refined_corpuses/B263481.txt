(see smith v. robbins (2000) 528 u.s. 259, 276-284.) on august 14, 2015, we advised defendant that he had 30 days within which to personally submit any contentions or arguments he wishes us to consider. no response has been received. we find no reasonably arguable contentions are raised by the order under review. on october 25, 1991, defendant pled guilty to two counts of second degree robbery in violation of section 211. on july 14, 1995, defendant was convicted following a jury trial of one count of deadly weapon assault in violation of section 245, subdivision (a)(1). after the aggravated assault jury verdict was recorded, defendant admitted that his prior october 25, 1991 convictions were serious felonies pursuant to penal code section 667, subdivision (a). defendant received a sentence of 25 years to life, plus a 5 year enhancement. in his resentencing motion, defendant asserts his prior robbery convictions should be resentenced as misdemeanors under section 1170.18. in his resentencing motion, defendant relied upon section 490.2, subdivision (a) (section 490.2), which provides in r any other provision of law defining grand theft, obtaining any property by theft where the value of the money, labor, real or personal property taken does not exceed nine hundred fifty dollars ($950) shall be considered petty theft and shall be punished resentencing motion, without citation to any evidence, contends his prior robbery convictions did not result in the taking of property worth more than $950. 1 unless otherwise noted, future statutory references are to the penal code. 3 section 1170.18 rently serving a sentence for a conviction, whether by trial or plea, of a felony or felonies who would have been guilty of a misdemeanor under ththis ) had this act been in effect at the time of the offense may petition section 1170.18 lists section 490.2 as one of the newly added sections that would qualify as a misdemeanor. defendant here is in effect asserting his second degree robbery convictions would have been misdemeanors under section 490.2. section 490.2 is inapplicable here. the court of appeal considered a similar issue regarding a defendant convicted under vehicle code section 10851, subdivision (a) in people v. page (2015) 241 cal.app.4th 714, 717-720. in page, the defendant asserted his conviction under vehicle code section 10851, subdivision (a) should be resentenced as a misdemeanor and also relied upon section 490.2. (ibid.) the court of appeal more than amend the definition of grand theft, as articulated in penal code section 487 or any other provision of law, redefining a limited subset of offenses that would formerly have been grand theft to be petty theft. (pen. code,  490.2.) vehicle code section 10851 does not proscribe theft of either the grand or petty variety, but rather the taking or driving of a . . . penal code section 490.2 is simply inapplicable to offense.people v. page, supra, 241 cal.app.4th at p. 719, fn. omitted.) section possession of another, from his person or immediate presence, and against his will, unlawful taking, they are substantively not the same crime. our supreme court held: [citation.] theft by larceny may be committed without force or the threat of violence and may be completed without the victim ever being present.

(people v. page, supra, 241 cal.app.4th at p. 719, fn. 2; people v. sherow (2015) 239 cal.app.4th 875, 879.) defendant has not sustained his burden of proof in this regard. resentencing motion is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports turner, p. j. we concur: kriegler, j. baker, j.
