(see stats. 2017, ch. 677,  1, eff. jan. 1, 2018.) the amendment was effective january 1, 2018. (ibid.) the amendment eliminated all but one prior conviction that can support a three-year enhancement under section 11370.2. as amended, section 11370.2 permits an enhancement only for a prior conviction for violating, or conspiring to violate, section 11380, which punishes the use or inducement of a minor to commit specified controlled substance offenses. important for this case, the amendment eliminated sections 11378 and 11379 as predicate offenses for the three-year enhancement. thus, under section 11370.2 as amended, cutting was not subject to the nine-year enhancement that the trial court ordered. both parties agree that the amendment to section 11370.2 applies to all cases that were not final as of january 1, 2018. in 5 particular, the attorney general agrees that, as explained in people v. millan (2018) 20 cal.app.5th 450 (millan), the amendment to section 11370.2 applies retroactively under people v. estrada (1965) 63 cal.2d 740 (estrada). estrada held that, when the legislature enacts a statute determined that its former penalty was too severe and that a estrada, supra, 63 cal.2d at p. 745.) this rebuts the ordinary presumption that the legislature intends changes in the law to apply only prospectively. (ibid.) it creates legislature must have intended that the new statute imposing the new lighter penalty now deemed to be sufficient should apply ibid.) such cases include those that involve acts committed before the gment convicting the 2 (ibid.) as the court explained in millan, the 2017 amendment to section 11370.2 operates to lessen the punishment for a person whose sentence was enhanced based upon a prior conviction that may no longer serve as a predicate offense for the enhancement. (millan, supra, 20 cal.app.5th at pp. 455being subjected to a three-year enhancement for each prior conviction, such persons are no longer subject to any enhanced punishment id. at p. 456.) 2 (people v. smith (2015) 234 cal.app.4th 1460, 1465.) 6 consistent with the analysis in millan, the attorney general agrees that, if we should reverse the judgment and remand the case to the superior court for resentencing. however, the attorney general argues that we should not actually order that relief, because cutting did not obtain a certificate of probable cause for his appeal pursuant to penal code section 1237.5. the attorney general claims that, absent a certificate of probable cause, we may not reach the merits of the appeal. we disagrany agreed-upon component of his sentence. indeed, this case does not involve any sentencing agreement. cutting entered an open plea without receiving any promises about his sentence or any other negotiated benefit from entering the plea. his challenge to the sentence therefore does not attack the validity of his plea, and no certificate of probable cause is necessary. a. the certificate of probable cause requirement unless the defendant has filed a statement in the trial court tional, or other c prohowever, despite the broad language of this section, our supreme hat two types of issues may be raised in a guilty or nolo contendere plea appeal without issuance of a certificate: (1) search and seizure issues for which an appeal is provided under section 1538.5, subdivision (m); and (2) issues regarding proceedings held subsequent to the plea for the purpose of determining the degree of the crime and the 7 people v. panizzon (1996) 13 cal.4th 68, 74 (panizzon); see people v. french (2008) 43 cal.4th 36, 43 [a based upon grounds that arose after entry of the plea and that do not affect the valid8.304(b)(4)(b).) do require a certificate of probable cause. (panizzon, supra, 13 cal.4th at p. 76.) an appeal that challenges a specific negotiated sentence fchallenges the people v. buttram (2003) 30 cal.4th 773, 776 (buttram), citing panizzon, supra, 13 cal.4th 68.) in contrast, an appeal that simply challenges a sentence that falls within the range permitted by a plea agreement does not challenge the validity of the plea and may therefore proceed without a certificate. for example, in buttram, the court held that possible sentence did not require him to obtain a certificate of probable cause to argue on appeal that the trial court abused its discretion in deciding to impose the maximum. (buttram, at pp. 776777.) on the other hand, a defendant who agrees to a sentence authority to impose the maximum sentence without first obtaining a certificate of probable cause. (people v. shelton (2006) 37 cal.4th 759, 763 (shelton).) that conclusion follows from ordinary contract interpretation principles. (id. specification of a maximum sentence or lid in a plea agreement normally implies a mutual understanding of the defendant and the prosecutor that the specified maximum term is one that the 8 trial court may lawfully impose and also a mutual understanding that, absent the agreement for the lid, the trial court might id. at p. 768.) thus, where an agreement on a maximum sentence exists, an appeal authority to impose the maximum attacks a component of the plea agreement. the same analysis generally applies to a plea agreement that fixes a maximum statutory sentence through the device of dropping some counts in exchange for a plea to the remaining counts. (people v. cuevas (2008) 44 cal.4th 374, 377 (cuevas).) maximum possible sentence on the remaining counts is and parcel of the plea agreement(id. at p. 381, quoting panizzon, supra, 13 cal.4th at p. 78.) where such a plea agreement exists, an appeal that challenges maximum goes to the validity of the plea and requires a certificate of probable cause. (cuevas, at pp. 383384.) b. unlike the defendants in shelton and cuevas, cutting did not obtain any negotiated benefit from his guilty pleas. (shelton, supra, 37 cal.4th at p. 764; cuevas, supra, 44 cal.4th at pp. 377378.) cutting and the attorney general both agree that cutting entered an open plea to all the charges against him. an open plea is one under which the defendant is not offered any promises. [citation.unconditionally, admitting all charges and exposing himself to the maximum possible sentence if the court later chose to impose cuevas, at p. 381, fn. 4, quoting liang v. superior court (2002) 100 cal.app.4th 1047, 10551056.) 9 the record confirms that is what occurred here. at sentencing, the prosecutor described plea to the court cutting pleaded without condition to all the counts in the information. the prosecutor confirmed that cutting allegations and your probation violation, so that you may receive cutting was advised of the maximum possible statutory sentence based on his plea, but he was given no promises concerning the sentence that the trial court would impose. indeed, tagreement at sentencing you about the sentence that you could receive for this charge or for thus, unlike the appeals in shelton and cuevas, appeal is not inconsistent with any implicit promise that he made in connection with his sentencing. cutting neither made nor received any promises. he did not obtain any agreement on a maximum sentence, which would have implied an understanding and belief that in its absence the trial court might lawfully have shelton, supra, 37 cal.4th at p. 768.) to the contrary, he was advised that the trial court could impose the maximum sentence permitted by law. nor did he receive the benefit of any reduced maximum sentence by avoiding some of the counts with which he was charged. (see cuevas, supra, 44 cal.4th at pp. 383384.) he did not obtain any 10 negotiated benefit from his plea that would constrain his ability to challenge his sentence.3 despite this record, the attorney general argues that a certificate of probable cause is necessary because cuttinauthority to impose the sentence that he sentencing discretion. thus, the attorney general suggests that this case is less like buttram and more like shelton and cuevas. authority for his sentence based upon current law. but that is beside the point. unlike the defendants in shelton and cuevas, cutting did not enter into any plea agreement that would preclude him from challenging the legal basis for the sentence that he received.4 attack on the lawfulness of his sentence therefore does not challenge the validity of his plea. the attorney general cites people v. zuniga (2014) 225 cal.app.4th 1178 and other cases standing for the proposition that a defendant may not challenge his or her plea on appeal based on subsequent changes in the law. those cases are inapposite because, as discussed above, cutting does not 3 by pleading guilty, cutting might have obtained some benefit at sentencing from his decision to accept responsibility rather than going to trial. but that benefit, if any, resulted only from his decision to plead, not from any plea agreement. 4 if, for example, the legislature had changed the law between the time that cutting entered his plea and the time that he was sentenced, cutting would not have been precluded from arguing at sentencing that the trial court had no statutory authority to impose the enhancements under section 11370.2. 11 challenge the validity of his plea, but just the statutory basis for his sentence. thus, cutting does not require a certificate of probable cause to pursue this appeal, and this court is not precluded from reaching its merits. 2. the case must be remanded for resentencing cutting requests that this court reduce his sentence by simply striking the section 11370.2 enhancements and modifying the judgment accordingly under the authority of penal code section 1260. in contrast, the attorney general suggests that, in the event we reach the merits of should reverse the sentence and remand with directions to the trial court to strike the enhancements and resentence cutting. we agree with the attorney general. separate independent terms, but one term made up of interdependent components. the invalidity of one component infects the entire people v. hill (1986) 185 cal.app.3d 831, 834.) the section 11370.2 enhancements here were a component of the sentence that the trial court selected to obtain an aggregate prison term. without those enhancements, the trial court might have made different decisions with respect to other components of the sentence (such as selecting consecutive rather than concurrent terms). we therefore leave to the trial court to determine the appropriate sentence in light of all the relevant factors, including the changed legal landscape with respect to the section 11370.2 enhancements. 12 disposition the judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with directions to strike the enhancements under section 11370.2 and to impose a new sentence. in all other respects, the judgment is affirmed. not to be published. lui, p. j. we concur: chavez, j. hoffstadt, j.
