(people v. johnson (1980) 26 cal.3d 557, 578.) the appellate court presumes in support of the judgment the existence of every fact the trier could reasonably deduce from the evidence. (people v. reilly (1970) 3 cal.3d 421, 425; accord, people v. pensinger (1991) 52 cal.3d 1210, 1237.) the same standard applies when the conviction rests primarily on circumstantial evidence. (people v. perez (1992) 2 cal.4th 1117, 1124.) although it is the jurys duty to acquit a defendant if it finds the circumstantial evidence susceptible of two reasonable interpretations, one of which suggests guilt and the other innocence, it is the jury, not the appellate court that must be convinced of the defendants guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. (ibid.people v. kraft (2000) 23 cal.4th 978, 1053-1054.) present his case to us consistently with the substantial evidence standard of review. that is, the defendant must set forth in his opening brief all of the material evidence on the disputed elements of the crime in the light most favorable to the people, and then must persuade us that evidence cannot reasonably support the jurys verdict. (see people v. dougherty (1982) 138 cal.app.3d 278, 282.) if the defendant fails to present us with all the relevant evidence, or fails to present that evidence in the light most favorable to the people, then he cannot carry his burden of showing the evidence was insufficient because support for the jurypeople v. sanghera (2006) 139 cal.app.4th 1567, 1574.) s opening brief must: [] . . .

(people v. sanghera, supra, 139 cal.app.4th at p. 1574.) statute of limitations defendants argue that the statute of limitations under section 803, subdivision 7 me [powers] felony complaint filed on march 21, 2013, was filed beyond the limitations period. defendants also argue that the theft alleged in count 46 was completed in 2005 , and michelson was reasonably suspicious throughout 2005, expressing concern about the transactions and the commissions powers was receiving, and asking for copies of all purchase agreements and corresponding checks for the first time. citing people v. zamora (1976) 18 cal.3d 538, 561-562, defendants also make the argument that the statute of limitations period began to run in 2005 when michelson, as a reasonably prudent person, would have been suspicious of fraud. standard of review ing the statute of limitations has been tried, we review the record to determine whether substantial evidence supports the findings of the trier of fact. (people v. ruiloba (2005) 131 cal.app.4th 674, 681-682; people v. padfield (1982) 136 cal.app.3d 218, 226.) statutes of limitation must be strictly construed in favor of a defendant. (people v. zamora (1976) 18 cal.3d 538, 574 (zamora).) the statute of limitations is not an element of the crime; although the prosecution has the burden of proving the criminal action was commenced within the applicable limitations period, its burden of proof is by a preponderance of the evidence.

(people v. petronella (2013) 218 cal.app.4th 945, 956; people v. soni (2005) 134 cal.app.4th 1510, 1518; people v. crossman (1989) 210 similar tolling statute, a discovery was held not to have occurred even though officials learned substantial facts which would have only created a suspicion of wrongdoing. (com. v. hawkins (1982) 294 pa.super 57.) similarly, in people v. swinney [1975] 46 cal.app.3d 332, 337, the court concluded the triggering of a period of limitations on concealed thefts requires more than mere discovery of a loss; it requires an awareness the loss occurred by virtue of a criminal agency. (people v. kronemyer (1987) 189 cal.app.3d 314, 334; italics people v. crossman, supra, at p. 481.) facts relating to the statute of limitations issue our review of the record reveals the following facts constituting substantial a rican properties increased in 2005. david cohen, to reconcile purchases and expenses, but the documents were not sufficient,2 so he turned to powers for help. powers wrote to michelson on november 29, 2005 (exh. no. 133), with a variety of explanations for why complete documentation was unavailable, including an inability to make copies, family disputes among sellers, and confusing 2 having difficulty getting information from powers in costa rica was a problem dating back to 2001. 9 payment schedules. he expressed a desire to create clearer and l these transactions over the last few years have been done with great diligence , cohen told michelson something was very wrong. michelson then told powers that cohen thought something was wrong because they could not get the records. cohen and michelson repeatedly asked powers for documentation at the end of 2005 through 2006. powers promised the documents, but they were never sufficient. on march 15, 2006, powers wrote a letter to cohen (exh. no. 41) summarizing property purchases in 2005, and reflecting that powers received commissions averaging 5.6 percent but varying substantially in percentage among the various properties. this was the first time michelson learned that powers was taking multiple levels of commissions. he was concerned with what powers was doing, but was not suspicious. in a letter to michelson dated may 18, 2006 (exh. no. 20), powers identified additional accounting issue is almost completed, so they tell me, and should be sent out to you next michelson went to costa rica from march 23-26, 2006, intending to hire another person, andres marten, to take over his operations. on march 24 and 25, 2006, michelson toured the properties that had been purchased, finding them neither lush nor densely planted with trees. defendants assured michelson the properties did not look lush because it was the dry season, and that the properties were 70 percent planted with teak trees. in 2007, michelson filed a criminal complaint in costa rica and a civil action against powers. before learning that campbell had received over $1 million from the , which was more than its value. 10 analysis period did not commence, as a matter of law, when michelson learned on march 15, 2006, that powers was collecting multiple levels of commissions. michelson testified he was concerned with what powers was doing, but he specifically testified he was not suspicious. the jury could take into aactually collecting less than the 6 percent commissions agreed to by the parties, as evidence that a reasonably prudent person in michelson position had no reason to suspect criminal wrongdoing. the jury could rationally conclude the concerns expressed by michelson were a product of communication problems dating back to 2001. significantly, powers continued to secure properties for michelson to purchase, and powers assured michelson in his letter dated may 18, 2006, that the accounting issues were almost completed. he told powers that cohen felt something was wrong with the production of documentation. michelson never testified that either he, or cohen, believed the existence of a criminal agency was the root cause of the problem obtaining the documents needed for tax preparation purposes. the jury could rationally conclude that the problem presented amounted to proof of communication issues relating to transactions in a foreign country, rather than the existence of a criminal agency. viewed in the light most favorable to the judgment, we hold that a rational trier of fact could find that michelson was unaware of either a loss or the existence of a criminal agency until he personally observed the state of the purchased land on march 24 and 25, 2006, during his visit to costa rica. defendants have not established a violation of the statute of limitations as a matter of law. 11 refusal to instruct on withholding of evidence by the prosecution defendants argue that the prosecution failed to turn over a computer hard drive seized from powers in costa rica, and that the trial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury on the discovery failure pursuant to calcrim no. 306. defendants argue they had specifically requested disclosure of all evidence pursuant to the discovery provisions of penal code section 1054.1 and calcrim no. 306 shall disclose to the defendant or his or her attorney all of the following materials and information, if it is in the possession of the prosecuting attorney or if the prosecuting attorney knows it to be in the possession of the investigating agencies: [] . . . [] (c) all relevant real evidence seized or obtained as a part of the investigation of the offenses ays prior to trial. ( 1054.7.) upon calcrim no. 306 provides in pertinedefense must disclose their evidence to the other side before trial, within the time limits set by law. failure to follow this rule may deny the other side the chance to produce all relevant evidence, to counter opposing evidence, or to receive a fair trial. [] an attorney for the (people/defense) failed to disclose: ________ <describe evidence that was not disclosed> [within the legal time period]. [] in evaluating the weight and 12 significance of that evidence, you may consider the effect, if any, of that late disclosure. [] [however, the fact that the defendants attorney failed to disclose evidence [within the legal time period] is not evidence that the defendant committed a crime.] [] <consider for multiple defendant cases> [] [you must not consider the fact that an attorney for defendant ________ <insert defendants name> failed to disclose evidence when you decide the charges against defendant[s] ________ <insert names of other defendant[s]> analysis we need not address the merits of this contention, as defendants have failed to opening brief admits the is nothing in the record to suggest the e-mails presented to the jury do not accurately reflect what was on the hard drive. although defendants contend there was insufficient proof of chain of custody of the hard drive, on appeal they make no substantive argument on this issue supported by citation of authority. as noted by the trial court, defendants were aware of the existence of the hard drive and the e-mails from the time of the preliminary hearing, and although a general discovery request for all relevant evidence was made in a timely fashion, defendants never expressly asked for production of the hard drive. under the circumstances of this case, it is not reasonably probable defendants would have received a more favorable result had the court instructed the jury pursuant to calcrim no. 306. (cal. const., art. vi,  13; people v. watson (1956) 46 cal.2d 818, 836.) reduction to misdemeanor theft under penal code section 1157 defendants argues the information alleged a theft in excess of $400, the jury was not instructed under current law that a grand theft is committed by the taking in excess of 13 $950, the jury returned no verdict finding the amount of the loss in count 46, and pursuant to section 1157, the verdict must be construed to be petty theft. although defendants are correct the information alleged only a taking in excess of $400 and the jury was not instructed on the dollar amount required for grand theft, we conclude there is no basis to reduce the offense to petty theft under the circumstances of this case. penal code section 1157, related statutes, and applicable case law which is distinguished into degrees, the jury, or the court if a jury trial is waived, must find the degree of the crime or attempted crime of which he is guilty. upon the failure of the jury or the court to so determine, the degree of the crime or attempted crime of which the defendcient to allege that the charging document specify whether the alleged crime constitutes grand theft or petty theft. (people v. anderson (people v. ortega (1998) 19 cal.4th 686, 696-697 (ortega).) analysis the substantive charge in count 46 was grand theft. there was never a suggestion in the trial court that, if defendants were guilty, the crime was anything less than grand theft. the defense position at trial was that defendants were not guilty; they did not contend they were guilty of petty theft. the trial court read the information to the jury immediately prior to the opening statements of counsel. the jury was told that count 46 alleged that defendants committed grand theft of money exceeding $400, in the amount of $759,600, which was used to 14 purchase costa rican parcels 5-85742, 5-29451, 5-34097, and 5-2962. as pled, count 46 involved a charge that was unmistakably grand theft. the jury convicted defendants of the offense as charged. the verdict form on of personal property, in violation of penal code section 487(a), a felony, as charged in count 3 of the informationitalics added.) as charged in the information, defendants committed grand theft of $759,600. it is of no moment that the jury found not true the two excessive taking special allegations alleged as to count 46. the allegation under section 186.11, subdivision (a)(2)that the taking resulted in a loss of more than $500,000was not applicable because this enhancement allegation requires commission of two or more felonies, and defendants were only convicted of one felony. the excessive taking allegation under section 12022.6 was also inapplicable, because it alleged a cumulative loss greater than $2.5 million. here there was no cumulative loss, and the amount of the theft in count 46 was far less than $2.5 million. there was no basis for the jury to find true the second excessive taking allegation. harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. (neder v. united states (1999) 527 u.s. 1, 15-16; people v. mil (2012) 53 cal.4th 400, 413-414.) by finding defendants guilty as charged, the jury necessarily found a taking far in excess of $950. (see people v. preciado (1991) 233 cal.app.3d 1244, 1247-1248 [jury verdict finding defendant guilty of residential burglary as charged in the information sufficient to fix the offense as burglary in the first degree].) the essence of count 46 was that michelson would not have wired $759,600 to powers for the purchase of the properties identified in count 46 had he known defendants were engaged in a scheme to misrepresent the costs and quality of the properties, with the defendants persistently argue on appeal that the offense in count 46 could amount to no more than a petty theft because michelson did not ultimately suffer a loss on his investments. from this premise, they contend the jury did not necessarily find a theft of 15 $950 or more. this is incorrect, because loss to the victim is not an element of theft by trick or device. (people v. traster (2003) 111 cal.app.4th 1377, 1390 theft by trick and device are: (1) the obtaining of the possession of the property of another by some trick or device; (2) the intent by the person so obtaining possession to convert it to his own use and to permanently deprive the owner of it; and (3) that the owner, although parting with possession to such person, does not intend to transfer his we are satisfied that any error in failing to instruct on the $950 loss required for grand theft was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. (chapman v. california (1967) 386 u.s. 18, 24.) reduction to a misdemeanor pursuant to proposition 47 defendants next argue that pursuant to the ameliorative provisions of proposition 47, the conviction in count 46 must be reduced to a misdemeanor because there is no proof the value of the property taken exceeded $950. (see  490.2 [obtaining any property by theft where the value does not exceed $950 shall be treated as a misdemeanor].) we reject the contention. as discussed in the preceding section of this opinion, defendants took property by theft with a value far in excess of $950. section 490.2 has no application in this case. application of misdemeanor statute of limitations finally, defendants contend that because, in their view, they were convicted of a misdemeanor, the one-year statute of limitations applicable to misdemeanors applies, and the conviction in count 46 is time-barred. we have rejected the contentions that the conviction should be treated as a misdemeanor. as a consequence, the misdemeanor statute of limitations has no application. 16 disposition the judgments are affirmed. kriegler, j. we concur: turner, p. j. kumar, j. judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
