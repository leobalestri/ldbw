to woodman and nordhoff to pick up a fare. codefendant erick gonzalez1 entered the cab. at request, castro eventually took him to a nightclub near hollywood and highland. castro asked for his money.

must be reversed, (2) his convictions on counts 2 and 13 must be reversed, (3) his convictions on counts 3 and 12 must be reversed, (4) the trial court erred by giving calcrim no. 334, (5) he was instruction as to count 1 that consent was a defense not vitiated by fraud, (6) the penal 5 code section 12022.53, subdivision (b) enhancement as to count 1 must be stricken, (7) the trial court failed to exercise its informed discretion when imposing a consecutive determinate term, and appellant was denied effective assistance of counsel by his trial concerning that discretion, and (8) appellant is entitled to additional conduct credits. discussion 1. se imprisonment (count 10) must be reversed. lesser included offense of kidnapping to rob castro (count 8) and kidnapping him during a cas conviction on count 10 must be reversed. we accept the concession. (people v. shadden (2001) 93 cal.app.4th 164, 171.) we cf. people v. ortiz (2002) 101 cal.app.4th 410, 415, 417; people v. contreras (1997) 55 cal.app.4th 760, 762, 765.) 2. acking (counts 2 & 13) must be reversed. against barajas and castro (counts 2 & 13, respectively) are lesser included offenses of his offenses of kidnapping counts 2 and 13 must be reversed. we accept the concession. (people v. duran (2001) 88 cal.app.4th 1371, 1374.) we wiand dismiss those counts. 3. there was sufficient evidence the robberies at issue in counts 3 and 12 were of the first degree. appellant claims there is insufficient evidence the robberies at issue in counts 3 and 12 were of the first degree for purposes of penal code section 212.5, subdivision (a). in particular, h that subdivision because he was [ing] a taxicab without a franchise granted by the city of los angelesas required by los angeles municipal 6 code section 71.02, subdivision (b), and because he was operating a taxicab without the claim. penal code section 212.5, subdivision (a) states first degree robbery includes the any person who is performing his or her duties as an operator of any . . . guity in this language, we presume the legislature meant what it said, and the plain meaning of the subdivision governs. (see people v. superior court (ghilotti) (2002) 27 cal.4th 888, 905.) an operator is one who operates, means use to function [usually] by direct personal 2 a chauffeur-driven automobile available on call to carry a passenger between any two points (as within a city) for a fare determined by a taximeter, zone system, or flat rate3 any person who is performing his . . . duties as an meaning of section 212.5, subdivision (a). penal code section 212.5, subdivision (a) does not refer to los angeles municipal code section 71.02, subdivision (b), or vice versa. appellant cites no case holding penal code section 212.5, subdivision (a) must be construed in light of los angeles municipal regulation of operation. moreover, in people v. mcdade (1991) 230 cal.app.3d 118, the court, discussing penal code section 212.5, subdiv obbery legislation emphasizes personal protection. implementing its intent to protect robbery victims, the legislature has developed a statutory scheme increasing sentences for increased victim mcdade, at p. 12 2 websters third new international dictionary (1961) page 1581. 3 age 2345. id.) 7 hire and are more vulnerable than members of the public generally. conditioning application of subdivision (a) on whether appellant complied with local franchising and permit requirements would disserincreased victim vulnerability. 4. calcrim no. 334 was correct. appellant claims the trial court erred by giving calcrim no. 334. we reject the claim. in people v. coffman and marlow (2004) 34 cal.4th 1 (coffman), two codefendants, accomplices to each other, each testified at trial and sought to blame the other for the offenses. (id. at pp. 104-105.) coffman reviewed a jury instruction advising caution when the jury considered an accomplice-defendacodefendant. (id. at p. 104.) after quoting the particularly worded instruction in that case, coffman observed, the testimony of an accomplice that is unfavorable to the defense is to be viewed with care and caution. (people v. guiuan (1998) 18 cal.4th 558, 569 [guiuancoffman, supra, 34 cal.4th at p. 105, fn. 36.) the instruction in guiuan accomplice gives testimony that tends to incriminate the defendant, it should be viewed with caution. this does not mean, however, that you may arbitrarily disregard that testimony. you should give that testimony the weight you think it deserves after examining it with car (guiuan, supra, 18 cal.4th at p. 569.) the pertinent portion of calcrim no. 334 given in the present case was essentially the same as the guiuan instruction.4 appellant argues calcrim no. 334 is erroneous because it refers to accomplice testimony that tends to incriminate the 4 calcrim no. 334 stated, incriminate the defendant should be viewed with caution. you may not, however, arbitrarily disregard it. you should give that testimony the weight you think it deserves after examining it with care and caution and in the light of all 8 accomplice testimony that tends appellant maintains since he was an accomplice and a defendant, use of the word not only told the jury to view with caution testimony to the extent it tended to incriminate gonzales as a codefendant, but erroneously told the jury to view with caution to the extent it was offered in his own defense as a there was no error. the instruction given to the jury in the present case is essentially the same one coffman and guiuan approvingly cited. moreover, in the mplice if he or she is the instruction, reasonably understood, different persons, i.e., one r could appellant logically present testimony tending to incriminate him on a charge, in his own defense on that charge. there is no reasonable likelihood the jury would have construed calcrim no. 334 as appellant suggests.5 (see people v. kelly (1992) 1 cal.4th 495, 525.) was beneficial to him testimony should be viewed with caution to the extent it incriminated him. appellant conced 5 people v. fowler (1987) 196 cal.app.3d 79, 85 (fowler), cited by appellant, does not compel a contrary conclusion. in fowler, unlike the present case, the court instructed the testimony of an accomplice which tends to incriminate the other in the offense for which they are on trial should be viewed with distrust.fowler, at p. 85, italics added.) coffman characterized the fowler distrust everything an accomplice-coffman, supra, 34 cal.4th at p. 105, fn. 37, italics added.) the calcrim no. 334 instruction used in the present case did not found in the fowler instruction. 9 appellant excepts from the above concessions count 1, arguing that, based on testimony in his own defense as to count 1. however, as to that count, our analysis in part 5 of our discussion post not prejudicial the alleged constitutionally-deficient representation discussed there, also render not prejudicial the instructional error alleged here. (people v. watson (1956) 46 cal.2d 818, 836; fowler, supra, 196 cal.app.3d at p. 88.) 5. appellant was not denied effective assistance of counsel. appellant claims he was denied effective assistance of counsel by his trial a defense not vitiated by fraud.6 the trial court instructed the jury to prove count 1, the people had to r, appellant in essence argues he was entitled to an instruction consent was not vitiated by the fact barajas inducement of the consent did not vitiate it. appellant maintains his trial counsel should have requested such an instruction because appellant testified to the effect barajas drove voluntarily, i.e., no kidnapping occurred, and appellant carjacked and robbed barajas only after he stopped. we reject appella manner challenged, the record does not reflect said counsel was asked for an explanation and failed to provide one, and we cannot say there simply could have been no satisfactory (see people v. slaughter 6 ([citation]; people v. green people v. majors (2004) 33 cal.4th 321, 327 (majors).) 10 (2002) 27 cal.4th 1187, 1219 (slaughter); people v. ledesma (1987) 43 cal.3d 171, 216-217.) second, there were satisfactory reasons appellantmay not have requested the pinpoint instruction. first, the court instructed the jury kidnapping required force or . . . instilling . . . majors, supra, 33 cal.4th at p. 327.) during jury counsel reasonably could have believed it was sufficient to argue the absence of force or threat without also arguing the intertwined concept fraud did not vitiate consent. further, leaving aside count 1, and athey are lesser included offenses, we note appellant committed two aggravated kidnappings (counts 8 & 9), five robberies (counts 3, 5 7 & 12), and carjacking (count 4), i.e., multiple offenses involving force or fear and/or lack of victim consent. he also committed criminal threats (count 11), threatening to kill or cause great bodily injury to castro. the above remaining offenses were evidence of a common design or plan to use force or fear and, therefore, evidence appellant used force or instilled reasonable fear in barajas. (see people v. ewoldt (1994) 7 cal.4th 380, 394, fn. 2, 403.) counsel reasonably could have refrained from requesting the pinpoint instruction because he believed said offenses were so potent as evidence appellant used force or instilled reasonable fear in barajas, with the result movement was not consensual, that the pinpoint instruction would have had no impact on the verdict. similarly, the remaining offenses were morally turpitudinous and . refrained from requesting the pinpoint instruction because he believed said offenses were so impeaching the instruction would have had no impact on the verdict. 11 was not consensual. the remaining offenses discussed above were common design evidence and impeachment evidence as previously discussed. had requested, and the trial court had given, the pinpoint instruction consent was a defense not vitiated by fraud, it is not reasonably probable the instruction would have had any impact on the verdict. any constitutionally-deficient representation was not prejudicial. (see slaughter, supra, 27 cal.4th at p. 1219.) 6. the penal code section 12022.53, subdivision (b) enhancement as to count 1 must be stricken. -year penal code section 12022.53, subdivision (b) enhancement as to count 1. however, as to count 1, there were no such enhancement allegation, nor was any such allegation as to count 1 admitted by appellant or found true by the jury. respondent concedes said enhancement must be stricken. we accept the concession. (pen. code,  12022.53, subd. (j).) 7. the trial court failed to exercise its informed discretion when imposing a consecutive determinate term. during the january 28, 2013 sentencing hearing, the court stated as follows. appellant had wanted to take a package deal involving a prison sentence of 32 years for him, but gonzalez did not accept the deal. if the court could have sentenced appellant to court would have done so, but it could not becauminimum that i can by law. . . . t 12 as mentioned, the court sentenced appellant to prison for life with the possibility of parole plus 10 years on count 1, and for 23 years on count 4, with concurrent or stayed sentences on the remaining counts. the trial court did not expressly state whether the sentence on count 4 was concurrent or consecutive. however, the aggregate term is life plus [10] respondent concedes this case must be remanded because the trial court failed to exercise its discretion as to whether to impose the determinate term of 23 years concurrently or consecutively. it appears the trial court imposed the 23-year prison sentence on count 4 consecutive to the indeterminate sentence on count 1, even though the trial court indicated it wanted to impose the minimum possible sentence, and even though the court could have achieved that result by imposing concurrent sentences on people v. felix (2000) 22 cal.4th 651, 655; pen. code,  669.) we will prison sentence and remand the matter to permit the trial court to resentence appellant to prison (with precommitment credit) and to exercise its informed discretion as to whether to impose any determinate term concurrently or consecutively.7 we express no opinion as to how the court should exercise that discretion or as to new prison sentence, or any component thereof, should be. 8. there appellant claims he is entitled to additional precommitment conduct credit. there is no need to address the issue. we are remanding the matter and are confident the trial court following remand will award appropriate precommitment credit. 7 in light of the above, there ineffective assistance of counsel because his trial counsel failed to inform the court it had the discretion at issue. 13 disposition the judgment is (count 10) and his convictions for carjacking barajas and castro (counts 2 & 13, respectively) are reversed and counts 2, 10, and 13 are dismissed; penal code section 12022.53, subdivision (b) enhancement as to count 1precommitment credit award, are ; and the matter is remanded for resentencing to permit the trial court to exercise its discretion as to whether to impose concurrently or consecutively to count 1 any determinate term, and to permit the trial court to award all precommitment credit to which appellant is entitled. the trial court is directed to forward to the department of corrections an amended abstract of judgment. not to be published in the official reports kitching, j. we concur: croskey, acting p. j. aldrich, j.
