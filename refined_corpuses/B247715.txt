(2011) 201 cal.app.4th 296, review granted march 14, 2012, s199289, for the proposition that deeming his two prior convictions as strikes constituted a breach of contract. since review has been granted, that case is no longer good law.2 defendant asserts that at the time of the 2 in people v. jerry z., the defendant claimed that, as part of his plea bargain, he was promised that he would no longer be required to register as a sex offender under section 290.5 if he successfully completed probation and committed no additional crimes for a period of 10 years. he stated he was promised that he would be permitted to withdraw his plea, have the charges dismissed under section 1203.4, and obtain a certificate of rehabilitation under section 4852.01 et seq. u3 implied, was that any future enhancement under [section] 667 would be of five or one year; adding a strike to the pleas modified significantly the bargain, rendering his present sentence unconst s a result of a plea the supreme court recently addressed the issue he law in effect at the time of a plea agreement binds the parties, or (doe v. harris (2013) 57 cal.4th 64, 66 (doe).) the supreme court cited with approval the rule set forth in people v. gipson (2004) 117 cal.app.4th 1065 (gipson), in which the court applied a retroactive change in recidivism sentencing under the three strikes law despite the existence of a plea agreement under prior law. according to gipson, a relationship infused with a substantial public interest, subject to plenary control by the state, such contract or transaction is deemed to incorporate and contemplate not only the existing law but the reserve power of the state to amend the law or enact additional laws for the public good and in pursuance of public policy . . . (doe, supra, at p. 70, quoting in re marriage of walton (1972) 28 cal.app.3d 108, 112; see gipson, supra, at p. 1070.) doe gipson explains that the parties to a plea agreementan agreement unquestionably infused with a substantial public interest and subject to the plenary control of the stateare deemed to know and understand that the state, again subject to the limitations imposed by the federal and state constitutions, may enact laws that will affect the consequences attending the (doe, supra, at p. 70.) in addition, granted jerry z. the relief he requested. (people v. jerry z., supra, 201 cal.app.4th at pp. 309, 313, 328, review granted march 14, 2012, s199289.) 4 statutory consequence of a conviction should not ordinarily be interpreted to be an (id. at p. 71.) the court in doe noted thatplea bargain might affirmatively agree or implicitly understand the consequences of a plea will remain fixed despite amendments to the relevant law. this inquiry, however, representations made and other circumstanc(doe, supra, 57 cal.4th at p. 71.) as we have stated, the record contains no facts regarding the prior proceedings in which defendant was convicted of the strike offenses. accordingly, as in gipson, he 1994 amendment to section 667 did not affect plea bargain; it did not create or destroy any substantive rights defendant had in the plea bargain. subsequent to the plea bargain, the legislature amended the law; defendant committed another crime; defendant became subject to the penalty described in the amended statute. the increased penalty in the current case had nothing to do with the previous case except that the existence of the previous case brought defendant within the description of persons eligible foran enhanced sentence under the three strikes law. (gipson, supra, 117 cal.app.4th at p. 1070.) moreover, although defendants 1991 and 1993 strike convictions were sustained before implementation of the three strikes law, courts have consistently held that utilizing such a prior conviction to sentence under the three strikes law does not violate due process and ex post facto considerations. (see, e.g., people v. gray (1998) 66 cal.app.4th 973, 995; people v. brady (1995) 34 cal.app.4th 65, 7172.) 5 we have examined the entire record, and we are satisfied attorney has fully complied with her responsibilities and that no arguable issues exist. (people v. wende (1979) 25 cal.3d 436, 441.) petition is affirmed.
