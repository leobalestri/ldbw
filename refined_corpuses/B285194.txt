(accord, people v. minor (1980) 104 cal.app.3d 194, 200 (minor).) facts and procedural background i. facts in april 2017, defendant was lawfully arrested on the corner of fifth and main streets in downtown los angeles, california, an area known for trafficking in prescription pills. police searched defendant, and found 40 codeine pills in a $829 in various bills, and a set of car keys. police located the car associated with the car keys in a nearby parking garage; inside the car, they found a smorgasbord of different prescription medications, including alprazolam. ii. procedural background a. charges the people charged defendant with two counts of possessing controlled substances for sale (health & saf. code,  11351), with one count tied to his possession of codeine and the 3 other to his possession of alprazolam. the people alleged that defendant had three prior strike offenses under our three strikes law (pen. code,  667, subds. (b)-(j) & 1170.12, subds. (a)-(d)), seven prior prison terms (id.,  667.5, subd. (b)), and four prior controlled substances convictions (health & saf. code,  11370.2, subd. (a)). b. pretrial request for new counsel more than two months prior to trial, defendant informed the asked defendant to elaborate. defendant explained that he had a represent him because she wanted to file a motion for discovery under pitchess v. superior court (1974) 11 cal.3d 531, while he wanted to file a second motion to suppress under penal code section 1538.5 (his first motion had been denied). the trial court s done anything wrong or is not capable of representing d the motion. c. trial 1. mid-voir dire expression of dissatisfaction in the midst of several days of voir dire, defendant informed the court that he wanted to file a pitchess motion and asked how he could subpoena witnesses. the trial court responded that it was defense counselwitnesses. even her which witnesses to call. when the trial court asked defendant if he had defendant declined. 4 2. midtrial request for self-representation and for new counsel after several days of testimony, defendantthrough his attorneyinformed the trial court that he wanted to represent himself. after securing defendantwould be was four calendar days later), the trial court gave defendant a written waiver form to review and told defendant they would it is allow defendant to proceed pro se. defendant initialed the stated that he e form without reading it. counsel and clarified that he was asking for the trial court stated thappears . . . that you really do not want to represent yourself. t disappointment with appointed counsel ground upon which to gr when a few minutes later, defendant explained why he wanted to absent himself from the courtroom except during his own testimony: can hear what i have got to say. defendant ultimately decided to remain in the courtroom. 3. verdicts the trial court instructed the jury on the charged crimes as well as the lesser included misdemeanor offense of simple 5 possession. the jury acquitted defendant of the felony possession for sale charges, and convicted him of the misdemeanors. 4. sentencing the trial court sentenced defendant to 728 days in the county jail, comprised of 364 days for each of the misdemeanor counts, to be served consecutively. d. appeal defendant filed this timely appeal. discussion defendant argues that his convictions must be overturned because the trial court did not conduct an in camera hearing in response to his midtrial request for new counsel. his argument is well taken. the sixth amendment guarantees the right to the appointment of counsel in felony cases. (gideon v. wainwright (1963) 372 u.s. 335, 344-345.) this guarantee does not confer upon a criminal defendant the right to the appointed counsel of his choice (people v. suff (2014) 58 cal.4th 1013, 1040), but it does secure the right to the appointment of new counsel if the adequate representation, or (2) so embroiled in an irreconcilable conflict with him that ineffective representation is likely to result. (people v. abilez (2007) 41 cal.4th 472, 487-488; people v. clark (2011) 52 cal.4th 856, 912 (clark); see generally marsden, supra, 2 cal.3d at p. 123.) to effectuate this right, a state the reasons why he believes that a court-appointed attorney people v. lucky (1988) 45 cal.3d 259, 6 281-282 & fn. 8; people v. valdez (2004) 32 cal.4th 73, 95; people v. sanchez (2011) 53 cal.4th 80, 89-90.) although such a so-called marsden motion is reviewed for an abuse of discretion (people v. taylor (2010) 48 cal.4th 574, 599), a trial court generally abuses that discretion if it does not hold a hearing when a defendant makes a sufficiently clear request for a new appointed attorney (marsden, at p. 124). the trial court abused its discretion in this case. during the midtrial exchange, defendant clearly indicated his desire for a his current attorney and was what is more, the trial court heard defendant loud and clear e counsel. yet the trial court did not convene a hearing to allow defendant to explain the reasons for his request. this was error. the people make three arguments in response. first, the people cite already a second time were the same reasons he requested new counsel two months prior to trial, thereby making a further marsden hearing unnecessary. to be sure, a trial court need not convene a further marsden hearing if it has already held one, and if the defendarenewed complaints rest on the same grounds. (people v. clark (1992) 3 cal.4th 41, 104 [no further hearing required where people v. vera (2004) 122 cal.app.4th 970, 980 [7 representation. it is also not reasonabfirst request was more than two months earlier and was based on a disagreement over pretrial motion strategy; his second request occurred midcontemporaneous comments, seemed to be based upon disagreements over which witnesses to call and which questions to ask defendant during his testimony. seem to deal mostly with trial strategy, which is an insufficient basis for replacing appointed counsel. this is true (clark, supra, 52 cal.4th at p. 912), but this argument rests on the assumption marsden motion was disagreement over trial strategy. this assumption is wholly speculative precisely because the trial court never inquired into the basis for his second motion. lastly, the people liken this case to people v. gonzalez (2012) 210 cal.app.4th 724. gonzalez is inapt because there, clear indication that [the defendant] id. at p. 741.) -representation, then new counsel, and also threatening to absent himself from trial, has more than a whiff of gamesmanship. (see people v. hill (1983) 148 cal.app.3d 744, 762, marsden/faretta proceedingsfor making a marsden motion does not relieve a trial court of its well-established duty to inquire into the basis for that motion. contrary to what defendant contends8 case does not entitle defendant to vacation of his convictions. instead, we conditionally reverse the convictions, and order that the trial court conduct an in camera hearing at which defendant may state his reasons for desiring the appointment of new counsel and, if those reasons satisfy s requirements for the appointment of new counsel, order a new trial. (minor, supra, 104 cal.app.3d at p. 200; people v. olivencia (1988) 204 cal.app.3d 1391, 1400-1401.) disposition the judgment is conditionally reversed. the trial court is ordered to schedule a hearing, give notice of that hearing to defendant and his counsel, and if defendant appears at that hearing, conduct an in camera hearing at which defendant may state his reasons for desiring the appointment of new counsel. if those reasons satisfy s requirements for the appointment of new counsel, the court must order a new trial; if they do not, the convictions shall be affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. ______________________, j. hoffstadt we concur: _________________________, acting p. j. ashmann-gerst _________________________, j. chavez
