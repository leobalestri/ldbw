(a).)1 appellant pleaded not guilty. on august 5, 2011, the jury found appellant guilty of second degree murder. appellant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 15 years to life. facts a. prosecution evidence in september 2006, appellant pleaded guilty to driving under the influence. he was placed on probation until you continue to drive under the influence of alcohol, drugs, or both[,] and between 7:00 and 8:00 p.m. on february 19, 2010, appellant and michelle garcia began a visit with oscar and mary portillo in their home in palmdale. during the evening, appellant drank approximately six bottles of beer. garcia had no alcoholic drinks. at or shortly after 2:00 a.m., appellant and garcia left the porwhile appellant sat in the front passenger seat, and both wore seat belts. 1 all further statutory citations are to the penal code. 3 shortly after 3:00 a.m. on february 20, 2010, los angeles county deputy sheriffs responded to a overturned car in an open field near avenue s in the palmdale area. deputy seat wearing the seat belt. the car contained no one else. after an ambulance took appellant away, the deputy sheriffs found garcia face down on the ground 30 to 40 yards behind the car. she was determined to be dead. a.m. and 5:14 a.m., was .21 percent. at approximately 8:00 p.m., california highway patrol officers interviewed appellant. he acknowledged that he had suffered a prior conviction for driving under the influence, but denied that he was placed on probation for the offense. he could not recall what had occurred after 2 on the basis of skid marks, investigating officers concluded that the car had been travelling approximately 76 miles per hour when it veered across the road, overturned on a raised median, and rolled over for approximately 200 feet. only incident. an autopsy established that garcia had fatal injuries consistent with her having been ejected from the car. b. defense evidence edward acosta, an appointed defense investigator, testified that he who had responded to the accident call on february 20, 2010. according to 2 an audio recording of the interview was played for the jury. 4 acosta, wright said that appellant was not wearing a seat belt when he saw him inside the car. discussion appellant contends the trial court erred in declining to instruct the jury regarding involuntary manslaughter as a lesser included offense of murder and vehicular manslaughter as a lesser related offense of murder. as explained below, we disagree. a. governing principles generally, the trial court is obligated to instruct sua sponte on lesser included offenses that the evidence tends to prove, even the parties object to the instruction on tactical grounds. (people v. breverman (1998) 19 cal.4th 142, 154-155 (breverman).) for purposes of this rule, courts apply the so-called he charging allegations of the accusatory pleading include language describing the [charged] offense in such a way that if committed as specified [the candidate] lesser [included] offense 3 (people v. montoya (2004) 33 cal.4th 1031, 1035, quoting people v. lopez (1998) 19 cal.4th 282, 288-289.) the court must instruct 3 in certain other contexts, courts apply the so-whether an offense in necessarily included within a charged offense. (people v. reed (2006) 38 cal.4th 1224, 1227-statutory elements of the greater offense include all of the statutory elements of the id. at p. 1227.) this test is properly employed in determining whether a defendant may be convicted of multiple charged crimes. (id. at p. 1231.) 5 on any lesser included offense for which there is substantial evidence to support a conviction (breverman, supra, 19 cal.4th at p. 162), but not if the pertinent people v. springfield (1993) 13 cal.app.4th 1674, 1680). the rule obliging the trial court to instruct on lesser included offenses flows (people v. birks (1998) 19 cal.4th 108, 118 (birksabsence of a request, the trial court must instruct on the general principles of law relevant to the issues raised by the evidence. [citations.] the general principles of law governing the case are those principles closely and openly connected with people v. st. martin (1970) 1 cal.3d 524, 531.) as our supreme court has explained, the instructional rule regarding lesser included offenses implements this general duty in a manner that benefits both defense and prosecution. (birks, supra, 19 cal.4th at p. 119.) the rule preserves ses to be charged, ensures that the defendant has adequate notice of the offenses alleged and prevents either party -or-nothing verdict when the pleadings and id. at pp. 118, 127.) regarding the latter id. at p. 127.) in contrast, the trial court is not required to instruct on lesser related substantial evidence to support a conviction for the offense. (birks, supra, 19 cal.4th at p. 137; people v. lam (2010) 184 cal.app.4th 580, 583; people v. 6 valentine (2006) 143 cal.app.4th 1383, 1387.) although an instruction on a lesser related offense is proper if both defense and prosecution agree to it, the (birks, supra, at p. 136, fn. 19; people v. lam, supra, at p. 583; people v. valentine, supra, at p. 1387.) this requirement for mutual agreement reduces the is not denied notice of the lesser related offense and that the prosecution has an adequate opportunity to prove it. (see birks, supra, 19 cal.4th at pp. 128-129.) doctrine of the separation of powers to select the offenses to be charged against a defendant. (id. at pp. 134-constitution should not be construed to grant criminal defendants an affirmative right to insist on jury consideration of nonincluded offenses without the id. at p. 136.) b. lesser included offense appellant contends the trial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury on involuntary manslaughter as a lesser included offense of murder. subdivision (b) of sectinot amounting to felony; or in the commission of a lawful act which might produce death, in an unlawful manner, or without due caution and offense of murder (people v. sanchez (2001) 24 cal.4th 983, 991, overruled on another point in people v. reed, supra, 38 cal.4th at p. 1228), appellant maintains that the court was obliged to instruct on involuntary manslaughter. he points in 7 lawful act -- driving a car -- in an unlawful or reckless manner. as explained below, he is mistaken. legislature has imposed on involuntary manslaughter. subdivision (b) of section ed in the driving of a people v. superior court (romero) (1996) 13 cal.4th 497, 516, quoting keeler v. superior court (1970) 2 cal.3d 619, 631 (keeler); accord, people v. farley (2009) 46 cal.4th crime . . . . people v. farley, at p. 1119, italics omitted.) an instructive application of this principle is found in keeler. there, the supreme court addressed the then-effective version of section 187, which defined keeler, supra, 2 cal.3d at p. 619.) the court held that the doctrine of the separation of viable fetus, reasoning that the term, as used by the legislature in enacting the id. at p. 632.) (id. at pp. 632-633.) here, the legislature has defined involuntary manslaughter in a manner that for this reason, the trial court was obliged to instruct on the offense only if there was substantial evidence that appellant committed it while not driving the car. as 8 there was none, the court properly declined to instruct the jury on involuntary manslaughter. (people v. ferguson (2011) 194 cal.app.4th 1070, 1082-1085.) manslaughter contravened his rights to present a defense under the united states constitution and california law. we disagree. our supreme court has repeatedly determined that the federal constitution establishes no right in noncapital cases to instructions on lesser included offenses, and only a limited right to instructions in capital cases. (e.g., breverman, supras careful disclaimers, and its tendency to interpret related federal rules . . . in a narrow way, we decline to do what the high court has expressly not done -- to hold that such an instructional rule is required in noncapital cases by the federal constitupeople v. rundle (2006) 43 cal.4th 76, 148, disapproved on another ground in people v. doolin (2009) 45 cal.4th state has created an artificial barrier to the juravailable noncapital verdict, there is no federal constitutional right to instruction people v. taylor (2010) 48 cal.4th 574, 624-625, a death penalty case. there, our supreme court held that an instruction on a lesser included offense was properly denied because there was insufficient evidence to support a conviction for the offense. (id. at p. 624.) in so concluding, the court refusal to give the instruction violated his federal constitutional rights to present a included offense that substid. at p. 625.) in view of people v. taylor 9 constitutional rights in declining to instruct on involuntary manslaughter. r california law. generally, the trial instructions adequate for the case. (people v. stewart (1976) 16 cal.3d 133, 140.) for this reason, the trial court may decline to give an instruction related to a defense when there is no substantial evidence to support the instruction. (people v. salas (2006) 37 cal.4th 967, 982-983; people v. villanueva (2008) 169 cal.app.4th 41, 49.) as explained above, that is the case here. because the legislature has restricted involuntary manslaughter so that it cannot be committed by a defendant who causes a death while driving, the trial court had no duty to instruct on the offense as a defense theory. (see people v. saille (1991) 54 cal.3d 1103, 1120 [courts are not required to instruct on the defense of diminished capacity after its abolition].) in sum, the trial court was not obliged to instruct the jury on involuntary manslaughter as a lesser included offense of murder. c. lesser related offense appellant contends the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury on vehicular manslaughter as a lesser related offense to attempted murder. he does not dispute that vehicular manslaughter was not a lesser included offence of murder under the accusatory pleading test, as the information lacked any allegations regarding the driving of a vehicle.4 (see people v. sanchez, supra, 24 cal.4th at pp. 991-992.) nor does he dispute that under birks, supra, 4 under section 192, subdivision (c), vehicular manslaughter can be 10 19 cal.4th 108, trial courts must refuse to instruct on a lesser related offense when, as here, the prosecution has objected to the instruction. instead, he maintains that birks was wrongly decided, arguing that the refusal to instruct on vehicular manslaughter contravened his federal constitutional rights to present a defense.5 this argument fails, as our supreme court has reaffirmed birks in response to contentions of this type, including contentions framed in terms of a right to present a defense. (people v. rundle, supra, federal constitutional right of a defendant to compel the giving of lesser-related- accord, people v. foster (2010) 50 cal.4th 1301, 1343-1344.) we are bound by these determinations. (auto equity sales, inc. v. superior court (1962) 57 cal.2d 450, 455.) to defense instructions under california law. as explained above (see pt. b., antegeneral instructional duty. in birks, our supreme court examined the application of this general duty to lesser related offenses. (birks, supra, 19 cal.4th at pp. 118-132.) because the obligation to give defense instructions stems from the general duty, it provides no independent basis to depart from birks.6 5 in birks, the supreme court abrogated people v. geiger (1984) 35 cal.3d 510 (geiger), which held that defendants were entitled to instructions on lesser related offenses upon request, provided certain minimal conditions were met. (birks, supra, 19 cal.4th at pp. 115, 122.) 6 appellant suggests that under people v. lagunas (1994) 8 cal.4th 1030, 1036-1038, defendants have a state constitutional right to defense-related instructions on lesser related offenses upon request. however, lagunas merely applied geiger, which was overuled in birks (see fn. 5, ante). 11 when the pleadibirks, supra, 19 cal.4th at pp. 119, 127). however, the decision presented to the jury resulted directly from the selection of the offense charged against appellant. both the legislative restriction and the prosecutorial decision constituted legitimate exercises of authority that we are obliged to respect under the separation of powers doctrine. (keeler, supra, 2 cal.3d at pp. 632-633; birks, supra, 19 cal.4th at p. 136.) the requested instruction on vehicular manslaughter by presenting evidence that appellant committed a murder while driving a car. we reject this contention, as holding that the mere submission of evidence bearing on a lesser related offense entitles the defendant to instructions on it would gut birks. in a related contention, appellant argues that the information was defective because it contained no allegation that he committed the murder while driving a car. this contention fails, as an information need not allege the particular manner in which a crime is committed.
