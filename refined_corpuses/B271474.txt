(d)), a felony offense. the trial court also convicted hanna of misdemeanor battery ( 242).3 the trial court acquitted hanna on the remaining counts and sentenced hanna to one year in county jail followed by three years of formal probation. on appeal, hanna claimed the evidence was insufficient to establish the elements that ms. j. was unconscious of the nature of the act and that he knew ms. j. was not aware of its nature.4 we affirmed. we first held 3 stated that hanna was convicted of misdemeanor sexual battery ( 243.4, subd. (d)(1)). a review of the minute order amended to change the count to misdemeanor battery instead. 4 section 289, subdivision (dperson who commits an act of sexual penetration, and the victim is at the time unconscious of the nature of the act and this is known to the person committing the act or causing the act to be committed, shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for three, six, or eight years. as used in incapable of resisting because the victim . . . : [] (1) [w]as unconscious or asleep.

(people v. soriano (1987) 194 cal.app.3d 1470, 1474.) moreover, the petition will not lie for the correction of errors at law. (people v. kim (2009) 45 cal.4th 1078, 1093.) 6 in lyu, the defendant was convicted of sexual penetration by a foreign object on an unconscious person. the defendant worked as a massage therapist and inserted his fingers inside a female client while massaging her legs. the woman then hit the defendant, said no, and asked what he was doing. the defendant started to sexually assault the woman, but she resisted and left the room. the defendant later admitted he sexually touched the woman but claimed she wanted sex from him. (lyu, supra, 203 cal.app.4th at pp. 12951298.) the prosecution argued that the woman was unconscious because she was on her stomach when the defendant sexually assaulted her, and she was unaware and did not expect him to sexually assault her. (id. unconsciousness argument because the woman was instantly awarethat the 7 on november 16, 2015, hanna filed a motion with the trial court hanna factually innocent of pen. code  289, subd. (d), offense and to set aside his conviction. relying on lyu, hanna argued that he was factually innocent of unlawful penetration of an unconscious person and asked the trial court to set aside his conviction under sections 851.86 and 1385.7 at the motion hearing, the trial court first asked defendant was committing a sexual assault. (id. at p. 1301.) we als argument to construe the statutory definition of unconsciousness to mean that the victim did not see the attack coming and was not aware or cognizant of it until it had occurred.ibid.) we further noted that the facts of that case did not involve unconsciousness based on the statutory definition of id. at p. 1302, fn. 10.) thus, we reversed the because of insufficient evidence of unconsciousness. (id. at p. 1299.) 7 henever a person is convicted of a charge, and the conviction is set aside based upon a determination that the person was factually innocent of the charge, the judge shall order that the records in the case be sealed, including any recif such an order is made, the defendant may then state he or she was not arrested for that charge and that he or she was not convicted of that charge, and that he or she was found innocent of that charge by the court.judge or magistrate may, either of his or her own motion or upon the application of the prosecuting attorney, and in furtherance of justice, order an action to be dismissed. under 8 s attorney, how do i grant a factual innocence noted that he could not take the usual approachfiling a habeas petitionsince hanna was no longer in custody. nevertheless, counsel contended, the trial court could dismiss the case in the interest of justice under section 1385 e very least, reduce it and then set it for review down the road where 8 section 1385 is to wipe the slate clean as if the defendant never suffered the prior conviction in the initial instance. in other words, the defendant stands as if he had never been prosecuted for the charged offense. (people v. simpson (1944) 66 cal.app.2d 319, 329.) 8 section 1203.4, subdivision (a)(1) provides in relevant a defendant has fulfilled the conditions of probation for the entire period of probation and is not then serving a sentence for any offense, on probation for any offense, or charged with the commission of any offense, then the defendant shall be permitted by the court to withdraw his or her guilty plea or, . . . if [the defendant] has been convicted after a plea of not guilty, the court shall set aside orthe defendant of his or her obligation to disclose the conviction in response to any direct question contained in any questionnaire or application for public office, [or] for licensure by any state or lodismissal disabilities(adams v. county of sacramento (1991) 235 cal.app.3d 872, 877878.) 9 the trial court observed. for the change nevertheless, the would be an appropriate vehicl the court noted. in the end, the trial court saidway to handle this would be. it is above my pay grade quite frankly. with that, the trial court denied the motion. hanna timely appealed. discussion i. hanna sought relief under the incorrect statute at its core, the present appeal poses a seemingly straightforward questionwhat is the appropriate procedural vehicle for a defendant challenging his conviction after he has completed his probationary sentence? the third district court of appeal recently answered this question, holding that section 1203.4 is the exclusive method for a trial court to dismiss the conviction of a defendant who has successfully completed probation. (people v. chavez (2016) 5 cal.app.5th 110, 113, review granted mar. 1, 2017, s238929 (chavez).) in chavez, supra, 5 cal.app.5th 110, the defendant pleaded no contest to charges that he offered to sell a controlled substance and failed to appear. the trial court suspended imposition of sentence and placed the defendant on probation for four years. after the defendant successfully 10 completed his probation in 2009, he filed a motion pursuant to section 1385, asking the trial court to dismiss the action in the interests of justice based on ineffective assistance of counsel and asserted legal errors. the trial court concluded that because the motion was brought pursuant to section 1385 rather than section 1203.4, it did not have authority after probation ended to grant the requested relief and thus denied the motion to dismiss. (id. at p. 113.) on appeal, the people contende denial was not an appealable order. the defendant maintained that the order was appealable and that the trial court erred in ruling it lacked authority to dismiss under section 1385. (ibid.) the appellate court concluded that while the denial was an appealable order, section 1203.4 is the exclusive method for a trial court to dismiss the conviction of a defendant who has successfully completed probation. (chavez, supra, 5 cal.app.5th at pp. 114115, 122.) accordingly, the trial court was without discretion to dismiss s conviction under section 1385. (id. at p. 122.) with respect to the threshold issuewhether the denial was an appealable orderthe appellate court noted that under section 1237, subdivisions (a) and (b), a defendant may appeal from a final judgment of conviction or from any order made after judgment that affects the substantial rights of the party.9 (id. at p. 114.) when a 9 under section 1237, subdivision (a), an appeal may be taken by the defendant from a final judgment of conviction, except as provided in sections 1237.1, 1237.2, and 1237.5, 11 defendant is granted probation and the probationary period expires without revocation, the order granting probation is a final judgment within the meaning of section 1237, subdivision (a), and thus an appealable order.10 (id. at p. 114.) next, the court traced the legislative history of section 1385, noting that section 1203.4 was enacted after section 1385 and is more specific. (chavez, supra, 5 cal.app.5th at pp. 117118.) while section 1383 is a general statute, relating to the broad scope of dismissal, section 1203.4 relates to the limited power of dismissal for purposes of probationthe very matter at issue. (id. at p. 118.) the conclusion that 1203.4 is the exclusive method for a trial court to dismiss the conviction of a defendant who has successfully completed probation. (id. at p. 119.) that year, the legislature expanded the class of defendants who could obtain section 1203.4 relief to include those who had not which are not applicable here. under section 1237, subdivision (b), an appeal may be taken by the defendant rom any order made after judgment, affecting the substantial rights of the party. 10 the court also held that an order denying relief under section 1203.4 is an order made after judgment, affecting the substantial rights of the party under section 1237, subdivision (b), and thus an appealable order. (chavez, supra, 5 cal.app.5th at pp. 114115.) as noted above, however, the defendant in chavez did not seek relief under section 1203.4. 12 successfully completed probation but who should be granted s discretion and in the interests of justice. it would not have been necessary for the legislature to amend section 1203.4 . . . if courts had retained authority to under section 1385 after the legislature enacted the original section 1203.4.(id. at pp. 119120.) the court also noted that california supreme court cases supported its conclusion that section 1203.4, and not section 1385, governs dismissal in a case where the defendant is granted probation and seeks dismissal after the expiration of the probationary period. (chavez, supra, 5 cal.app.5th at p. 120.) for example, in re herron (1933) 217 cal. 400, 405, addressed whether a trial court could set aside a conviction and dismiss an action after expiration of the probation period. there, the supreme court held that the power to dismiss an action under that circumstance was found in the original version of section 1203.4. likewise, in in re phillips (1941) 17 cal.2d 55, 59 and people v. banks (1959) 53 cal.2d 370, 384388, 391, the supreme court reiterated that section 1203.4 established the authority of a trial court to set aside the verdict after satisfactory completion of probation. (see people v. barraza (1994) 30 . . . is the only postconviction relief from the consequences of a valid criminal conviction available to a defendant; people v. picklesimer (2010) 48 cal.4th 330, 337, fn. 2 [ 1203.4 motion is rare exception to rule precluding postjudgment 13 motions].) moreover, subsequent amendments to section 1203.4 have only narrowed the applicability of the statute. (chavez, at pp. 120121.) it would nullify the restrictions imposed by the legislature and interpreted by the courts if we were to construe the statutes s discretion under section 1385 to s conviction.(id. at p. 121.) the reasoning in chavez, supra, 5 cal.app.5th 110 is persuasive as is the supporting authority cited therein. while section 1385 has potentially broad application, the california supreme court has cautioned that a trial court's p(people v. orin (1975) 13 cal.3d 937, 945.) indeed, the legislature can expressly n to dismiss under the statute. (people v. superior court (romero) (1996) 13 cal.4th 497, 518.) e to dismiss a criminal action under . . . section 1385 in the statute has never been held to authorize dismissal of an action after the imposition of sentence and rendition of judgment.(barraza, supra, 30 cal.app.4th at p. 121, fn. 8.) n the language of the (people v. kim (2012) 212 cal.app.4th 117, 122.) while section 1203.4 specifically grants the trial court has become final, by service of his or her sentence, section 14 1385 does not grant the trial court this jurisdiction. (see id. at p. 125 [once defendant completed sentence, trial court could not dismiss action under  1385].) here, as in chavez, supra, 5 cal.app.5th 110, the defendant sought relief under section 1385, not 1203.4.11 althoat a later date, the motion before the trial court sought a dismissal only under section 1385. thus, the trial court was without conviction.12 (see id. at p. 122.) 11 hanna, a native and citizen of egypt, faces removal from the united states due to his conviction. (see hanna v. mukasey (9th cir. 2008) 279 fed.appx. 584 [nonpub. opn.].) while an order granting a 1203.4 motion cannot eliminate the immigration consequences of a conviction (ramirez-castro v. immigration and naturalization service (9th cir. 2002) 287 f.3d 1172, 1173), a dismissal order under section 1385 can have such an effect as long as the conviction was vacated based on a defect in the underlying criminal proceedings. (matter of pickering (bia 2003) 23 i & n dec. 621, 624; cardoso-tlaseca v. gonzales (9th cir. 2006) 460 f.3d 1102, 1107.) 12 nsel, the supreme court has granted review in chavez, supra, 5 cal.app.5th 110. by order issued march 2, 2017, review is limited to two . . . section discretion under . . . section 1385 to dismiss a matter in the interests of justice? (2) do trial courts have authority to grant relief under . . . section 1385 after sentence has been imposed, judgment has been rendered, and any probation 15 ii. the people the people contends that nether section 851.86 nor section 1385 establish a right to seek relief in the trial court. we agree. as discussed above, the trial court was without discretion to dismiss s conviction under section 1385.13 section 851.86 is also an inappropriate vehicle for the relief sought by hanna. the statute contains no language permitting a defendant to petition the court for a finding of factual innocence. instead, it simply allows case records to be sealed after a conviction is set aside based on a determination of factual innocence. to the contrary, section 851.8 specifies who may petition the court for a finding of factual innocence and when. ( 851.8, subds. (a)-(e).) however, establishing factual innocence under section 851.8 entails establishing as a prima facie matter not necessarily just that the [defendant] had a viable substantive defense to the crime charged, but more fundamentally that there was no reasonable cause to arrest him (people has been completed?http://appellatecases.courtinfo. ca.gov> (as of june 16, 2017).) the opening brief was filed on june 5, 2017. until the supreme court issues its opinion, we will rely upon current and persuasive authority. 13 the people also contends that because section 1385 must be invoked by a trial court or prosecutor, rather than order. however, we consider the final judgment, rather than the denial, to be the order appealed from. (see chavez, supra, 5 cal.app.5th at p. 114; people v. chandler (1988) 203 cal.app.3d 782, 787.) 16 v. matthews (1992) 7 cal.app.4th 1052, 1056.) given that hanna has based his factual innocence claim on a case decided a decade after his arrest and conviction, he cannot possibly satisfy this standard. lastly, the people contends, must be dismissed because it is based on the same facts as his direct appeal and seeks to overrule our prior opinion affirming his conviction. the people correctly notes that the central issue raised in the instant appealwhether sufficient evidence suppconvictionwas raised in the prior appeal. however, hanna has cited new case law in support of the present claim, which means it cannot precisely duplicate the arguments on direct appeal. a habeas petitioner rejected on direct appeal when there has been a change in the law affecting the petitioner. (in re harris (1993) 5 cal.4th 813, 841.) while hanna is no longer in custody, neither the language of section 1203.4 nor the cases examining the statute prohibit a defendant from arguing that a change in law compels the requested relief. once again, however, the problem is not with the basis of claim but rather the procedural vehicle he employed when before the trial court.14 14 we note that in addition to section 1203.4, another statute may now provide an avenue of relief for hanna. effective january 1, 2017, section 1473.7 provides an explicit right for a person no longer imprisoned or restrained to prosecute a motion to vacate a conviction based on n]ewly 17 the trial court did not have an opportunity to evaluate claim pursuant to section 1203.4 or 1473.7. although hanna asks this court to construe this appeal as a writ petition in order to prevent another round of motions and appeals, we decline to do so in the first instance. nevertheless, our opinion should not be interpreted as precluding hanna from filing a section 1203.4 or 1473.7 motion with the trial court. disposition the order is affirmed. not to be published. johnson, j. we concur: chaney, acting p. j. lui, j. discovered evidence of actual innocence . . . that requires vacation of the conviction . . . as a matter of law or in the interests of justice.as long as a conviction is vacated based on a defect in the underlying criminal proceedings, the immigration consequences of that conviction should be eliminated.
