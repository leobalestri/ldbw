(b)), and one prior strike conviction ( 667, subds. (b)-(i), 1170.12, subds. (a)-(d)). on april 14, 2011, appellant was granted propria persona (pro per) status. on july 28, 2011, appellants pro per status was revoked, and the trial court appointed counsel. on november 4, 2011, the trial court granted appellants motion to strike the prior strike conviction pursuant to people v. superior court (romero) (1996) 13 cal.4th 497. appellant pled nolo contendere to the charged count, and the court found him guilty as charged. appellant also admitted the section 667.5, subdivision (b) allegations. at the sentencing hearing on january 23, 2012, the trial court placed appellant on formal probation for five years under the following terms and conditions: (1) that appellant serve 672 days in county jail, less 672 days credit for 1 all further statutory citations are to the penal code, unless otherwise indicated. 3 time served; (2) that he pay $70 in assessed fees and a $200 restitution fine, (3) that he complete a one-year treatment program at progress house, and (4) that he comply with various standard probation terms and conditions, including obeying all laws and orders of the court. on february 27, 2012, the probation department reported that appellant was in violation of the treatment terms of his probation, because he left progress house after one day. probation was revoked, and a bench warrant was issued for appellant. on april 2, 2012, the court found appellant had violated his probation (in case no. na088132) by committing a separate petty theft offense on february 17, 2012 (case no. na091565). appellant was represented by counsel at the april 2 hearing. on july 11, 2012, the trial court denied appellants motion to substitute counsel and granted his request for pro per status for subsequent proceedings. on october 17, 2012, the trial court denied appellants discovery motion for production of a videotape in his new theft case. the court then proceeded with sentencing on the probation violation. appellant contended that the prior judge had imposed and suspended a four-year sentence. upon review of the file, the court determined that no sentence had been imposed, but that appellant had been placed on five years probation. as the judge and prosecutor discussed the potential sentence, appellant interjected, wait a minute. i aint doing no probation hearing today. the court explained that the prosecutor was not discussing a hearing, but rather how many prior prison terms appellant had served. the prosecutor then continued, and concluded that the maximum term was seven years. appellant objected, arguing that the prior judge had not sentenced him to seven years. rather, [t]he judge gave me four years joint suspension, five years probation. 4 the court asked appellant if he had anything more to say. after first seeking to dismiss the new theft charge for failure to produce the videotape he had requested in discovery, appellant stated that he wanted to waive the probation until after the new case was over. appellant said he needed time to marshal and present evidence for the probation violation hearing. then he said, actually, on the probation, i want to be represented by counsel. the court asked why appellant had waited to make that request. appellant replied: because [the prosecutor was] talking about seven years. i dont know where he getting this from. so i rather have a lawyer . . . doing the probation hearing. the court stated: im inclined to rule this is intended just to delay proceedings. the prosecutor agreed. the court denied appellants request for counsel and stated that it was going to sentence appellant on the probation violation. appellant responded that he did not want to be sentenced today, and again asked for counsel. the court found that appellants request was done only for the purpose of delay. the court sentenced appellant to a total term of seven years in state prison, including the upper term of three years on count 1 (in case no. na088132) plus four years for the four prior convictions pursuant to section 667.5, subdivision (b). the court imposed the upper term based upon appellants prior criminal history and recent criminal conduct. appellant received 1,106 days of custody credit. the new theft charge in case number na091565 was dismissed. appellant timely appealed. discussion appellant contends the trial court abused its discretion by refusing to grant his request for counsel before sentencing on his probation violation. we disagree. in determining whether a trial court abused its discretion in denying a midtrial or posttrial request to appoint counsel for a criminal defendant who has 5 previously invoked his right to represent himself pursuant to faretta v. california (1975) 422 u.s. 806 (faretta), the reviewing court must consider[] the totality of the circumstances surrounding defendants revocation request. (people v. lawrence (2009) 46 cal.4th 186, 193 [midtrial request]; people v. ngaue (1991) 229 cal.app.3d 1115, 1124-1125 (ngaue) [posttrial request].) relevant factors for consideration may include: (1) defendants prior history in the substitution of counsel and in the desire to change from self-representation to counsel-representation, (2) the reasons set forth for the request, (3) the length and stage of the trial proceedings, (4) disruption or delay which reasonably might be expected to ensue from the granting of such motion, and (5) the likelihood of defendants effectiveness in defending against the charges if required to continue to act as his own attorney. (lawrence, supra, 46 cal.4th at p. 192, quoting people v. elliott (1977) 70 cal.app.3d 984, 993 (elliott), overruled on other grounds by people v. pompa-ortiz (1980) 27 cal.3d 519, 529.) although consideration of the elliott factors may suggest that counsel should be appointed for posttrial proceedings, the trial court retains discretion to deny a request for posttrial assistance of counsel where the request is made for a bad faith purpose, and factors such as the defendants history in substitution of attorneys or purpose to delay further proceedings may bear on the determination whether such a bad faith purpose exists. (ngaue, supra, at p. 1126.) here, the timing of appellants request for reappointed counsel suggests that the request was made in bad faith and for the improper purpose of seeking to delay the sentencing hearing. on july 11, 2012, appellant had requested and been granted his faretta right to represent himself for sentencing on his probation violation and for his new theft case. at the october 17, 2012 hearing, after the court denied appellants request for discovery in the new theft case, he repeatedly 6 sought to delay sentencing. appellant first stated that i aint doing no sentencing hearing today. then, he stated he wanted to waive the probation until his new theft case -- which was at a preliminary stage -- was over. finally, he sought additional time to prepare his defense on the probation violation, before abruptly changing his mind and requesting reappointment of counsel. in short, under the totality of the circumstances, the trial court did not exceed the bounds of reason in denying appellants request for the reappointment of counsel. moreover, we would find any error in denying the request was harmless, as it is not reasonably probable that appellant would have obtained a more favorable result if he had been represented by counsel. (ngaue, supra, 229 cal.app.3d at pp. 1126-1127 [error in denying defendants posttrial retraction of faretta waiver analyzed under the harmless error standard of people v. watson (1956) 46 cal.2d 818, 836], citing elliott, supra, 70 cal.app.3d at p. 998; accord people v. gonzalez (2012) 210 cal.app.4th 724, 744.) appellant sought appointed counsel because he was apparently confused about the maximum sentence he faced on the probation violation. that potential sentence, however, was determined by statute. moreover, the court imposed the upper term only after considering appellants history of recidivism. it is not reasonably probable that appointed counsel would have persuaded the court to impose a lighter sentence. thus, appellant cannot show that appointed counsel would have obtained a more favorable outcome. accordingly, there was no error in the denial of appellants request for reappointment of counsel.2 2 appellant contends the error should be reviewed under the harmless beyond a reasonable doubt standard set forth in chapman v. california (1967) 386 u.s. 18, 24 (chapman), citing people v. pompa-ortiz, supra, 27 cal.3d 519 and people v. boulware (1993) 20 cal.app.4th 1753. those cases are distinguishable, as they involved a denial of a request for reappointed counsel at the preliminary hearing 7 disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. manella, j. we concur: willhite, acting p. j. suzukawa, j. (see people v. pompa-ortiz, supra, at p. 529; people v. boulware, supra, at p. 1757). the denial of counsel at the preliminary hearing is federal constitutional error subject to chapman harmless-error analysis. (people v. pompa-ortiz, supra, at p. 530, citing coleman v. alabama (1970) 399 u.s. 1, 11.) in contrast, this case involves a posttrial request for reappointment of counsel, which does not implicate the same constitutional concerns. (elliott, supra, 70 cal.app.3d at p. 998.) moreover, even under chapman, we would find the error harmless, as there is no reasonable possibility that any error in denying the request to reappoint counsel would have affected the sentence. (see people v. gamache (2010) 48 cal.4th 347, 399, fn. 22 [error that has no reasonable possibility of affecting verdict is harmless under chapman].)
