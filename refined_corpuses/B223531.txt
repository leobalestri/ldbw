(a)) and admitted he occupied a position of special trust with respect to the children (id.,  1203.066, subd. (a)(9)). (people v. nguyen (super. ct. two preteen boys while he was a camp counselor. defendant was sentenced to state prison for five years. in 1996, the department of corrections referred defendant to the department of mental health (dmh) for evaluation under the sexually violent predators act (svpa, welf. & inst. code,  6600 et seq.). the dmh did not recommend commitment as a sexually violent predator (svp), and defendant was released on parole. (people v. nguyen (sept. 26, 2002, b149315) [nonpub. opn.] [2002 wl 31122803 at p. 5].) pornography. in an october 1997 parole search, photographs of naked boys were found he was arrested and returned to prison. (people v. nguyen, supra [2002 wl 31122803 at p. 5].) in 1998, the department of corrections again referred defendant to the dmh for filed a petition for commitment. following a court trial, defendant was adjudged a svp and committed to the dmh for two years, ending on april 24, 2002. defendant appealed 3 the commitment order. it was upheld on appeal. (people v. nguyen, supra [2002 wl 31122803 at pp. 5-6, 10].) on march 21, 2002, the county filed a petition to keep defendant committed as a svp. (people v. nguyen (super. ct. l.a. county, no. zm005292).) following a hearing, the court found probable cause to believe he would engage in sexually violent behavior if released from prison and ordered him to remain in custody. on march 23, 2004, the county filed a recommitment petition under the svpa. (people v. nguyen (super. ct. l.a. county, nos. zm007375, na017272).) on june 22, 2005, no. zm005292 was consolidated into no. zm007375, and the court found probable cause and ordered defendant to remain in custody. on april 4, 2006, the county again filed a recommitment petition under the svpa. (people v. nguyen (super. ct. l.a. county, nos. zm010052, na017272).) on october 31, 2006, the parties filed a stipulation to a continued commitment period of two years. this was in response to uncertainty over the retroactive effect of new legislation and a pending ballot initiative which would extend the commitment period for a svp from two years to an indeterminate term. the probable cause hearing was held on august 8, 2007. the court found probable cause and ordered defendant to remain in custody pending a trial. a jury trial began on april 1, 2008. however, the jury was unable to reach a prior to retrial, the county filed the instant petition on april 22, 2008. (people v. nguyen (super. ct. l.a. county, nos. zm013158, na017272).) defendant waived his the court found probable cause and ordered that defendant remain in custody pending trial. the trial court ordered no. zm010052 consolidated into no. zm013158, and a jury trial began on november 12, 2009. the prosecution presented testimony by one of by the police officer who conducted the 1997 parole search, and testimony by a police officer and investigator who discovered a 2006 letter from 4 defendant to a convicted sex offender containing lewd comments regarding boys. the prosecution also presented testimony by two clinical psychologists who evaluated defendant. defendant testified on his own behalf and presented testimony by two psychologists. he also presented testimony by a friend who was a minister who pledged to support defendant upon his release. at the conclusion of the trial, the jury found defendant to be a sexually violent predator. the trial court ordered an indeterminate term of commitment pursuant to welfare and institutions code section 6604. discussion a. voir dire after the 12 jurors had been selected and the parties were examining the prospective alternate jurors, the prosecutor exercised a peremptory challenge to excuse prospective alternate juror no. 3. at that point, defense counsel made an objection under people v. wheeler defense counsel requested a mistrial. am going to request that the [prosecutor] indicate her reasons on the record. they are i was asking her about the doctors and whether or not she was going to be able to listen to ding what i was saying, she paused and i believe the way she answered the question, i thought she just answered it because she had to not because she felt a certain way. [] i do feel that she has a difficulty understanding english. and she has no prior wheeler motion. defendant contends the trial court erred in failing to find a prima facie case of group bias. we disagree. 5 med to be valid. (people v. williams (1997) 16 cal.4th 153, 187; people v. wheeler, supra, 22 cal.3d at p. 278.) inasmuch as a peremptory challenge need not be exercised solely for a clearly identifiable bias, as opposed to a suspicion of potential bias, the presumption of validity people v. johnson (1989) 47 cal.3d 1194, 1215-1216; accord, people v. turner (1994) 8 cal.4th 137, 171, disapproved on another ground in people v. griffin (2004) 33 cal.4th 536, 555, fn. 5.) counsel may excuse potential jurors based on hunches or for arbitrary reasons, so long as they are unrelated to impermissible group bias. (people v. box (2000) 23 cal.4th 1153, 1186, fn. 6, disapproved on another ground in people v. martinez (2010) 47 cal.4th 911, 948, fn. 10; turner, supra, at p. 165.) thus, the burden is on the complaining party to make a prima facie showing that the peremptory challenges have been exercised in violation of the constitution. (johnson, supra, at p. 1216; see people v. crittenden (1994) 9 cal.4th 83, 115.) once a prima facie showing is made, the burden shifts to the party exercising the peremptory challenges to present a neutral explanation for the challenges related to the case. (people v. silva (2001) 25 cal.4th 345, 384; people v. williams, supra, 16 cal.4th at p. 187.) the trial court must then determine whether the opposing party has proved purposeful discrimination. (silva, supra, at p. 384.) if the court finds a prima facie case has not been made but nonetheless invites the prosecution to justify its peremptory challenges, the question before us is whether a prima facie case has been made. (people v. box, supra, 23 cal.4th at p. 1188; people v. welch explanations is necessary. (box, supra, at p. 1188; people v. davenport (1995) 11 cal.4th 1171, 1201.) in order to make a prima facie showing, the party making the motion must show from all the circumstances of the case that there is a strong likelihood the persons are 6 excluded because of their group association. (people v. box, supra, 23 cal.4th at pp. 1187-1188; people v. williams, supra, 16 cal.4th at p. 187.) it is true that unconstitutional exclusion may be shown in part by establishing a pattern of challenges eliminating most or all members of the cognizable group. (people v. crittenden, supra, 9 cal.4th at p. 115; people v. wheeler, supra, 22 cal.3d at pp. 280-281.) however, merely referring to the number of persons of a particular group excused by peremptory challenge is insufficient in itself to establish a prima facie case. (people v. dement (2011) 53 cal.4th 1, 19; people v. garcia (2011) 52 cal.4th 706, 747; crittenden, supra, at p. 119.) ude facie case. (people v. trevino (1997) 55 cal.app.4th 396, 406.) the trial court clearly did not err in finding defendant failed to make a prima facie showing of impermissible exclusion. the fact that the prosecutor had excluded three asians from the jury was not sufficient to establish a prima facie case. (people v. dement, supra, 53 cal.4th at p. 19; people v. garcia, supra, 52 cal.4th at p. 747; people v. crittenden, supra, 9 cal.4th at p. 119.) b. indeterminate commitment defendant contends that, pursuant to the october 31, 2006 stipulation, he could be committed only for an additional two-year period, not an indeterminate term. we disagree. the stipulatlegislation, was signed into law by the governor. additionally a ballot initiative legislation and the initiative include language which would lengthen the term of commitment for a svp from two years to an indeterminate term. due to uncertainty in mmitted and currently have a pending re- 7 additional petitions for extended commitments as they become timely pursuant to welfare and institutions code  6604.1. the dicriteria and commitment period in effect at the time of filing the re-commitment petitions. if a pending 2 year re-commitment petition filed prior to the effective date of the bill and/or initiative has not been tried prior to the expiration of the two-year commitment here, the recommitment petition filed on april 4, 2006 in case no. zm010052 was pending on october 31, 2006, when the stipulation was filed. the new legislation then became effective. the case went to trial on april 1, 2008, but the jury was unable to reach a verdict and a retrial was granted. a new recommitment petition was filed on april 22, 2008 in case no. zm013158. case no. zm010052 was consolidated into no. zm013158 and went to trial on november 12, 2009. at the conclusion of the original trial, defense counsel moved to dismiss the case, and the people requested a retrial. the court denied the defense motion and granted the retrial. in discussing the further proceedings to be held, the prosecutor stated that she can be filed. and then once that case is filed, a probable cause hearing is held. it can be aware, based on a stipulation and that stipulation being germane to the issue of whether or not mr. nguyen would be contesting a two-year or indeterminant [sic] commitment. the date certain as represented to me is april 24th would be the deadline for completing this trial. mr. nguyen will clearly suffer prejudice if not granted a trial date in time, at least make a reasonable attempt at the 24th. might have an opportunity to contest this within the constructs of the stipulation that 8 that needs to be resolved, specifically the prejudice suffered by mr. nguyen. because the idea was to complete the trial by a certain date and nobody made any provisions for a mistrial. . . matter to april 22 . it denied the request to stay the filing of any additional petitions. on april 22, the parties set august 6 as the date for the next hearing, at which they would either set a probable cause hearing or defendant would submit on the documentary evidence. on august 14, the court asked defense counsel why the case had not remained some discussioni pressed having a new trial within two weeks afterwards. my understanding was because ofto go to trial immediately, and because the people submitted a concurrent petition. [] so the next trial would actually be for a trial under two petitions rather than just the when the case finally went to trial, defense counsel objected to consolidation of the petitions, but the trial court overruled his objection. defendant first complains that the trial court failed to follow litmon v. superior court (2004) 123 cal.app.4th 1156 (litmon i). in litmon i, the petitioners were committed as svps. while recommitment petitions were pending, the people filed recommitment petitions were consolidated for trial. (id. at pp. 1162-1164.) recommitment petitions before trial on the second petitions. since the issue at trial is the (litmon i, supra, 123 cal.app.4th at pp. 1169-1170.) the bigger problem was the delay in trying the case, resulting in a second recommitment petition being filed before the first one was tried. (id 9 within which the probable cause hearing preceding a recommitment must be held. and, once probable cause is found, the svpa sets no time period within which the trial must be held . . . ibidid. at p. 1171.) however, in the absence of with existing statutory law . . . to bring svp petitions to trial expeditiously and certainly well before the expiration of the very two-(id. at p. 1172.) the court acknowledged that trial courts have the inherent power to consolidate svp petitions where appropriate. (litmon i, supra, 123 cal.app.4th at p. 1175.) the svpa evidences a legislative intent to provide a trial on every filed recommitment petition as close in time to the expiration of the prior commitment as practicable, it is error to order consolidation over objection when a consolidated trial can occur only id. at p. 1176.) citing the holding in litmon iin a hung jury andelayed, but not for the sole purpose of allowing consolidation and trial of the original petition with the newly-filed petition. thus, there was no failure to follow litmon i. an indeterminate term for recommitment when both a new petition was timely filed and when the earlier petition had not been tried prior to the expiration date of the earlier two-al prior to the expiration date of the prior commitment. [defendant] cannot be punished because 10 defendant appears to be claiming that the pursuant to the stipulation, if a recommitment petition was pending at the time of the stipulation and he was recommitted, he was entitled to the benefit of the stipulation and could only be recommitted for two years. this would be the case even if the trial of the petition took place after the effective date of the new statute permitting indeterminate terms of commitment. there is nothing in the language of the stipulation that mandates such a for extended commitments as they become timely pursuant to welfare and institutions code  period in effect at the time of filing the re-commitment petitions. if a pending 2 year re-commitment petition filed prior to the effective date of the bill and/or initiative has not been tried prior to the expiration of the two-year commitment period and a new petition is althoucertain things are clear. the april 4, 2006 recommitment petition was to continue -year term of commitment, about april 24, 2006. the stipulation was entered into on october 31, 2006, and the new law was to take effect later that year. at that point, defendant could expect, pursuant to the stipulation, that, assuming he was recommitted following trial, his current term of commitment would be for two years. that is, it would end about april 24, 2008. any petitions filed after the effective date of the new law could continue his commitment for an indeterminate term beyond april 24, 2008. trial on the pending recommitment petition began on april 1, 2008 and ended in a mistrial. prior to retrial, the instant petition was filed on april 22, 2008. trial on both petitions did not begin until november 12, 2009, well beyond the time defendant could have expected the stipulation to apply. 11 in claiming he was entitled to a two-year term of commitment, defendant relies on people v. litmon (2008) 162 cal.app.4th 383 (litmon ii) and people v. castillo (2010) 49 cal.4th 145. neither case supports his claim. in litmon ii, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss the pending recommitment petition, after trial was continued to a date beyond the expiration of the two-year commitment period, claiming violation of his rights to due process and a speedy trial. the trial court denied the motion on the ground there was no right to a speedy trial under the svpa. (people v. litmon, supra, 162 cal.app.4th at pp. 392-393.) trial was scheduled to begin in march 2007, after the effective date of the new law permitting indeterminate terms of commitment. (id. at p. 394.) on appeal, the court engaged in an in-depth analysis of the svpa and the meaning of due process. it concluded that the defendant had the right to due process in the context of proceedings under the svpa, and the delay violated that right. accordingly, the trial court should have granted his motion to dismiss. (people v. litmon, supra, 162 cal.app.4th at p. 406.) here, defendant did not move to dismiss the proceedings on the ground of violation of his right to due process. he merely opposed consolidation of the two recommitment petitions for trial. litmon ii does not bar the consolidation of two recommitment petitions for trial in every case. in people v. castillo, supra, 49 cal.4th 145, recommitment petitions were filed in august 2001, october 2003, and september 2005. they were consolidated for trial in january 2006. (id. at p. 148.) in october 2006, the defendant entered into the same stipulation at issue in the instant case. (id. at pp. 150-151.) after trial on the recommitment petitions in 2007, the defendant was found to continue to be a svp and, committed for a two-year term on each petition. (id. at pp. 152-153.) on appeal, the people claimed the two-year recommitment terms were invalid in light of the new law. the appellate court agreed and modified the commitment order to reflect an indeterminate term. (id. at p. 154.) the supreme court applied principles of judicial 12 estoppel to enforce the stipulation and bar the imposition of an indeterminate term in place of the two-year terms imposed by the trial court. (id. at p. 158.) unlike the situation in castillo, the instant case involves a recommitment petition filed after the effective date of the new law. the stipulation permitted the district violation of the stipulation justifying the imposition of judicial estoppel. in sum, we conclude that the trial court did not violate the stipulation by imposing an indeterminate term of commitment as a svp. c. exclusion of evidence defendant contends the trial court erroneously prevented him from eliciting highly relevant testimony concerning recidivism rates of persons formerly committed as svps, depriving him of a fair trial. we disagree. at issue is a study by clinical psychologist jesus padilla regarding recidivism. riginal trial and his retrial. the people objected to the admission of evidence of the study on the ground it was incomplete and therefore unreliable. the evidence was contained in a letter from dr. padilla to a public defender in a case in napa county. the judge in that case had ordered dr. padilla to release that had left atascadero state hospital without having had any treatment; they were released by the courts. however, dr. padilla testified in the evidence code section 402 hearing that his something that would have to happen before i would rely on it to make decisions for my validity of this study so that you can then say this is a valid study and these numbers are 13 the trial court excluded the evidence under evidence code section 352 on the ground it was raw data, without a complete study interpreting the data, and that created a danger of prejudice, confusing the issues or misleading the jury. the court viewed the g the exclusion of the evidence, he fails to cite a single authority to support his contention that the evidence should have been admitted. the question before us is not whether we agree with ial court abused its discretion in excluding it under evidence code section 352. (people v. waidla (2000) 22 cal.4th 690, 717.) only relevant evidence is admissible at trial. (evid. code,  350.) relevant son to prove or disprove any disputed id.,  210.) the trial court has the duty to determine the relevance and thus the admissibility of evidence before it can be admitted. (id.,  400, 402.) the trial court is vested with wide discretion in performing this duty. (people v. babbitt (1988) 45 cal.3d 660, 681.) however, it has no discretion to admit irrelevant evidence. (people v. babbitt (1988) 45 cal.3d 660, 681.) the value of an expbased and the reasoning leading from this material to a conclusion. (people v. coogler (1969) 71 cal.2d 153, 166; pacific gas & electric co. v. zuckerman (1987) 189 cal.app.3d 1113, 1135.) it must be based on the type of material reasonably relied upon by experts. (evid. code,  801, subd. (b); pacific gas & electric co., supra, at p. . . that is unreliable or irrelevant, or whose potential for prejudice outweighs its proper probative people v. carpenter (1999) 21 cal.4th 1016, 1061.) expert opinion testimony tying it to an issue in the case. dr. padilla testified that the 14 study information was not the type of material he would rely upon as an expert. the defense did not proffer any other expert willing to testify that the study information was the type of material reasonably relied upon by experts, and willing to form an opinion based on the information that was relevant to an issue in the case. since the defense failed to establish the reliability and relevancy of the evidence, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding it. (people v. waidla, supra, 22 cal.4th at p. 717; people v. carpenter, supra, 21 cal.4th at p. 1061.) d. constitutionality of 2006 amendment of the svpa defendant contends the 2006 amendment of the svpa allowing svps to be committed for indeterminate terms violates the constitutional rights to equal protection and due process and the proscription against ex post facto laws. the supreme court in people v. mckee (2010) 47 cal.4th 1172 addressed these claims. it rejected the due process and ex post facto claims. (id. at pp. 1193, 1195.) defendant acknowledges we auto equity sales, inc. v. superior court (1962) 57 cal.2d 450, 455) but raises the claims in order to preserve them for review by the federal courts. the supreme court found, however, that there was merit to the claim that the less favorably than those similarly situated individuals civilly committed under other people v. mckee, supra, 47 cal.4th at p. 1196.) it did not conclude that the not meet [their] burden of showing the differentimerely conclude that [they have] not yet done so. because neither the people nor the courts below properly understood this burden, the people will have an opportunity to id. at pp. 1207-1208.) defendant requests that we remand the case for further proceedings in the trial court as was done in mckee. the people request that we remand the matter to the trial court for reconsideration of the equal protection in light of mckee, ordering the trial 15 court to suspend the proceedings pending the finality of the proceedings on remand in mckee, as was done in people v. kisling (2011) 199 cal.app.4th 687, 695. we note that the supreme court, in cases raising the issue, has granted review [their] decision[s] and, in order to avoid an unnecessary multiplicity of proceedings, to suspend further proceedings pending finality of the proceedings on remand in [mckee], including any proceedings in san diego county superior court in which mckee may be people v. judge (s182384, review granted and transferred to the court of appeal july 28, 2010); people v. barbour (s183450, review granted and transferred to the court of appeal july 28, 2010); people v. mcknight (s183315, review granted and transferred to the court of people and follow the example of kisling. 16 disposition the order is reversecommitment violates the equal protection clause, and the case is remanded to the trial court for reconsideration of this question in light of people v. mckee, supra, 47 cal.4th 1172 and the resolution of the proceedings in that case on remand, including any other proceeding in the san diego superior court in which mckee may be consolidated with related matters. the trial court shall suspend further proceedings in this case pending the finality of any subsequent appeal and any proceedings in the california supreme court in mckee. in all other respects, the order is affirmed. jackson, j. we concur: woods, acting p. j. zelon, j.
