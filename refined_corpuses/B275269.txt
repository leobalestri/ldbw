(welf. & inst. code,  5361; people v. karriker (2007) 149 cal.app.4th 763, 774-775.) the lps act contains two definitions first, welfare and institutions code section 5008, subdivision (h)(1)(a), defines mental health disorder, is unable to provide for his or her basic personal needs for food, a conservatorship under the first definition is sometimes referred to as an lps conservatorship. (see county of los angeles v. superior court (2013) 222 cal.app.4th 434, 444.) second, welfare and institutions code section 5008, subdivision (h)(1)(b), defines mentally incompetent under section 1370 of the penal code and all of the following facts exist: [] (i) the indictment or information pending against the person at the time of commitment charges a felony involving death, great bodily harm, or a serious threat to the physical well-being of another person.

[] (iii) as a result of a mental health disorder, the person is unable to understand the nature and purpose of the proceedings taken against him or her and to a conservatorship imposed under the second definition of gravely disabled is known as a murphy conservatorship, named after the legislator who sponsored the amendment adding the definition to the lps act. (people v. karriker, supra, at p. 775.) 3 the public guardian is a mandated county officer. (gov. code,  24000, subd. (w).) in los angeles county the office of the public guardian, a division of the department of mental health, acts as conservatorship investigator and conservator for individuals who are seriously and persistently mentally ill and in need of involuntary mental health treatment, and for frail and vulnerable elderly or dependent adults. (welf. & inst. code,  5350, 5351, 5352.)county of los angeles v. superior court, supra, 222 cal.app.4th at p. 439, fn. 3.) 4 ordered the public guardian to provide a report addressing the murphy conservatorship. on july 15, 2015, the public guardian informed the court that suarez does not meet the criteria for a murphy conservatorship. on july 20, 2015, the court ruled that separate periods of commitment to patton would not be aggregated in calculating the maximum commitment date. the court concluded that commitment date was february 14, 2016. the court ordered that suarez continue to receive treatment at patton, and that the court receive reports addressing the likelihood of suarez regaining competency. on september 9, 2015, the court stood by its ruling that the maximum commitment is not aggregated and therefore february 14, 2016, terminated competency proceedings, although criminal proceedings remained suspended. the court ordered placement to be determined by the lps conservatorship. on october 20, 2015, the court read and considered a report from patton addressing the likelihood of suarez regaining competency. the court found that suarez remained mentally incompetent. on february 3, 2016, the court found suarez has reached his maximum commitment time, but has not reached his maximum confinement time on the criminal chargereasoning that suarez had not reached his maximum confinement time. the court reiterated that placement should be determined by the lps conservatorship. on march 30, 2016, suarez filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the trial court, arguing that because the court had found he reached his maximum commitment time, there is no legal basis on which to justify his continued confinement. therefore, suarez must be released or committed under alternative civil procedures. on april 13, 2016, the lps conservatorship was terminated for unstated reasons and suarez was released for further involuntary treatment as he was no longer under a conservatorship. dismissed by the court in department 95. at the may 16, 2016 hearing on the habeas corpus petition, the court noted that it received a progress report from patton asking the court to immediately return suarez to 5 the report from patton indicated that suarez had exceeded his maximum commitment of three years and has not recovered mental competency, citing section 1370, subdivision (c)(1). the court stated that the lps rethe court found that it would not be appropriate to return suarez to county jail as he would not be receiving commthe court noted that the district attorney refused to dismiss the charge against suarez. on may 23, 2016, patton filed a motion with the court seeking reconsideration of corpus petition. court issued an order to show cause on june 17, 2016. on june 20, 2016, the trial court ordered county counsel to conduct an investigation to determine if suarez is eligible for an lps conservatorship and report their findings to the court on july 20, 2016. discussion suarez contends that he has been unlawfully confined as he has exceeded the permissible commitment time under section 1370, subdivision (c). suarez is correct. in jackson v. indiana (1972) 406 u.s. 715 (jackson), the united states supreme court held thsolely on account of his incapacity to proceed to trial cannot be held more than the reasonable period of time necessary to determine whether there is a substantial probability that he will attain the capacity in the foreseeable future. if it is determined that this is not the case, then the state must either institute the customary civil commitment proceedings that would be required to commit indefinitely any other citizen, or releasid. at p. 738, fn. omitted.) the california supreme court 6 adopted the holding in jackson committed to state hospital solely on account of his incapacity to proceed to trial may be so confined more than a reasonable period of time necessary to determine whether there is a substantial likelihood that he will recover that capacity in the foreseeable future. unless such a showing of probable recovery is made within this period, defendant must in re davis (1973) 8 cal.3d 798, 801 (davis).) adjudged to punishment while that person is 1370, which governs criminal procedure following a finding that a defendant is incompetent as a result of a mental disordesection 1370 authorizes the court to commit an incompetent defendant to a state mental hospital for a period of no more than three years. (pen. code,  1370, subds. (a), (c).)[4] once committed to a state be filed with the court at statutorily provide intervals. if the medical staff determines that there is no substantial likelihood that the defendant will regain mental competence in the foreseeable future, the defendant must be returned to the court for further proceedings. people v. karriker (2007) 149 cal.app.4th 763, 780-781, fns. omitted.) any further commitment is permitted only if the requirements for a conservatorship under one of the provisions of the lps act (welf. & inst. code,  5000 et seq.) are met. (county of los angeles v. superior court (2013) 222 cal.app.4th 434, 443; people v. karriker, supra, at p. 776.) alternatively, the court can dismiss the charges and order the defendant released. (davis, supra, 4 the legislature added the three-year limit to section 1370 in response to the california supreme court decision in davis. (in re polk (1999) 71 cal.app.4th 1230, 1235.) 7 petitioners are making no reasonable progress toward that goal [restoring competency], they must be released or held subject to alternative commitment procedur here, the trial suarez on the instant criminal matter ended when he reached his maximum commitment date of three years pursuant to section 1370, subdivision (c). the court acknowledged that suarez had reached his maximum commitment date, as do the department of state hospitals and the district attorney in their briefs to this court.5 there had been no subsequent finding that suarez had a substantial likelihood that the will regain mental competence in the foreseeable future. the court was required to either dismiss the assault charge against suarez and release him, or initiate alternative commitment proceedings under the lps act. ( 1370, subds. (c)(2), (e); davis, supra, 8 cal.3d at pp. 805-807.) counsel for suarez cited statutory and decisional authority compelling this result, which the trial court was obligated to follow. (auto equity sales, inc. v. superior court (1962) 57 cal.2d 450, 455; see people v. rincon-pineda court in the instant case committed as set forth in footnote 3, ante, there are two types of conservatorships under the lps act. both ,although that phrase is defined in distinct waysone is referred to as the lps conservatorship (welf. & inst. code,  5008, subd. (h)(1)(a)), and the second is known as the murphy conservatorship (welf. & inst. code,  5008, subd. (h)(1)(b)). the court had conservatorship under the lps act. on february 18, 2015, the court ordered suarez evaluated at patton for a murphy conservatorship. on march 3, 2015, the court requested the public guardian initiate an investigation to evaluate suarez for a murphy conservatorship. on april 16, 2015, the department of mental health notified the court that suarez had been placed on a lps conservatorship. on june 24, 2015, the court 5 e three-year time period applies to the aggregate of all commitments on the same charges. (in re polk, supra, 71 cal.app.4th at p. 1238.) 8 ordered the public guardian to provide a report addressing the murphy conservatorship. on july 15, 2015, the public guardian informed the court that suarez did not meet the criteria for a murphy conservatorship. on september 9, 2015, and again on february 3, 2016, the court oon april 13, 2016, the lps conservatorship was terminated and suarez was released for further involuntary treatment as he was no longer under a conservatorship. on may 12, 2016, the ppetition to renew the conservatorship was dismissed by department 95. therefore, there has been a conclusive determination that suarez does not qualify for either the lps or murphy conservatorship. june 20, ity for the lps conservatorship, while laudable, are inconsistent with the prior determination by department 95 that suarez fails to qualify for such a conservatorship. because suarez has been detained beyond the three-year period permitted by section 1370, subdivision (c), he must be released from patton. disposition the petition for writ of habeas corpus is granted. patton state hospital is directed to return petitioner jose suarez to the los angeles county superior court for further proceedings under penal code section 1370, subdivision (c)(2). at the request of counsel for the department of state hospitals and counsel for suarez, patton state hospital is ordered to construct an appropriate aftercare plan within five calendar days after issuance of the remittitur. (health & saf. code,  1262.) upon return to the superior court, the court is ordered to act expeditiously pursuant to penal code section 1370, subdivision welfare and institutions code section 5008, subdivision (h)(1)(b). if the court finds suarez is gravely disabled, it shall then order the public guardian to initiate conservatorship proceedings. if the court finds suarez is not gravely disabled, the court shall order the felony complaint dismissed and suarez released from all custody on this 9 case. in the interest of justice and to prevent frustration of the relief granted, this decision shall be immediately final as to this court.
