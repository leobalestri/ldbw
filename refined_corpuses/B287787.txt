it resembled the car he released to defendant four and a half hours earlier. around 3:40 p.m. on november 13, 2014, santiago arrested defendant on an unrelated warrant at the apartment complex. 5. gang evidence as of november 2014, defendant and givens were both ies were murder, attempted murder, armed robbery, grand theft, burglary, home invasion, narcotic sales, and vandalism. be done by committing crimes with known gang members. the 7-eleven and the apartment complex territory. discussion 1. defendant contends the evidence is insufficient to support his convictions for aiding and abetting the kidnappings and robberies perpetrated by givens. specifically, defendant argues there was no substantial evidence he had knowledge that givens intended to kidnap and rob baires and melendez, or that defendant facilitated and aided givens in the commission of those crimes. at most, defendant argues, 8 strong suspicion that [defendant] knew what was going on we disagree. in assessing the sufficiency of the evidence, we review the entire record to determine whether any rational trier of fact could have found the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. (people v. zamudio (2008) 43 cal.4th 327, 357.) disclose substantial evidence to support the verdicti.e., evidence that is reasonable, credible, and of solid valuesuch that a reasonable trier of fact could find the defendant guilty (ibid.) in applying this test, we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution and presume in support of the judgment the existence of every fact the jury could reasonably deduce from the evidence. (people v. kraft (2000) 23 cal.4th 978, 1053.) we may not reweigh the evidence or resolve evidentiary conflicts. (people v. young (2005) 34 cal.4th 1149, 1181.) the same standard applies where the conviction rests primarily on circumstantial evidence. (people v. thompson (2010) 49 cal.4th 79, 113.) in short, we may not reverse a conviction for insufficient there sufficient substantial evidence to support [it (people v. bolin (1998) 18 cal.4th 297, 331.) a person aids and abets the commission of a crime when he or she, acting with (1) knowledge of the unlawful purpose of the perpetrator, and (2) the intent or purpose of committing, encouraging, or facilitating the commission of the offense, (3) by act or advice aids, promotes, encourages or instigates, the commission of the crime. (people v. marshall (1997) 15 cal.4th 1, 40.) aiding and abetting may be shown by circumstantial evidence. (people v. beeman (1984) 35 cal.3d 547, 558559.) 9 among the circumstances which may properly be considered in determining if a defendant acted as an aider and abettor are a r association with the principal, and his or her conduct before and after the offense. (people v. nguyen (2015) 61 cal.4th 1015, 1054.) reviewing the evidence here in the light most favorable to the judgment, we conclude there was sufficient evidence to sfirst, it is undisputed that defendant was present when the crimes began. defendant arrived with givens at the 7-eleven in the explorer and then followed the camry in the explorer after it drove away with givens in the back seat. second, defendant had an association with givensthey were both and the police saw them in the explorer at the apartment complex parking structure a few hours before the crimes were committed. from there, they drove to the 7-eleven, where they loitered for a while in the parking lot. 7-eleven suggests a measure of coordination with givens. shortly after baires and melendez arrived and entered the 7-eleven, defendant then followed baires and melendez into the store and kept them under close observation. defendant continued to follow the women as they left the store, got into the camry, and left the parking lot. and defendant drove the explorer in close pursuit of the camry harboring givens. accordingly, defendant was in a position to communicate with givens before the women left the store and got back into the camry, and to assist givens after the women drove 10 away from the 7-eleven with givens in the back seat of the camry. defendant cites people v. stankewitz (1990) 51 cal.3d 72, and people v. markus (1978) 82 cal.app.3d 477, for the proposition that his presence at the scene and failure to interfere to prevent the crimes do not constitute aiding and abetting. but well beyond simply being present at the scene or failing to prevent the crimes. as we explained, defendant shadowed the two victims inside the 7-eleven and then followed their car after they left the store. on this record, the jury could reasonably infer that defendant aided and abetted givens in committing the crimes. 2. remand is required for resentencing. senate bill no. 1393 (20172018 reg. sess.) (s.b. 1393), signed into law on september 30, 2018, and effective on january 1, 2019, amends sections 667 and 1385 to provide the trial court with discretion to strike five-year enhancements pursuant to section 667, subdivision (a)(1) in the interests of justice. the parties agree s.b. 1393 applies in this case, where the appeal was people v. vieira (2005) 35 cal.4th 264, 305306.) vacated and the matter remanded to afford the court an opportunity to exercise its new discretion under the amended statutes. (see peracchi v. superior court (2003) 30 cal.4th 1245, 1255 [at remand hearing, defendant has the right to the assistance of counsel and the right to be present].) 11 disposition the sentence is vacated and the matter is remanded for resentencing under s.b. 1393. in all other respects, we affirm. not to be published in the official reports lavin, j. we concur: edmon, p. j. egerton, j.
