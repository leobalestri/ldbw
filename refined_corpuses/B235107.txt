(a)(1)).1 the jury found true allegations that defendant had served two prior prison terms ( 667.5, subd. (b)) and had suffered a prior conviction under the three strikes law ( 1170.12, subds. (a)-(d), 667, subds. (b)-(i)). the trial court sentenced defendant to five years in state prison, calculated as the midterm of two years, doubled under the three strikes law, plus one year for one of the prior prison terms. defendant raises the following issues on appeal: (1) the trial court failed to exercise sound discretion when it erroneously concluded that doubling the sentence for a robbery prior conviction and imposition of a one year enhancement for a prior prison term, based on the same conviction, constituted an impermissible dual use of facts; (2) trial counsel was constitutionally inadequate due to a failure to possess knowledge of elementary rules of sentencing; (3) defendant was entitled to 332 days of presentence credit and 332 days of conduct credit or, in the alternative, 166 days of conduct credit, rather than the 66 days awarded; and (4) this court should conduct an independent pitchess2 motion. we resolve the first two issues by remanding the case to the trial court for resentencing defendant to a term of four years eight months, based on the sentence originally pronounced by the trial court. we conclude defendant is entitled to presentence credit of 332 days and conduct credit of 166 days in light of the holding of our supreme court in people v. brown (2012) 54 cal.4th 314 (brown). finally, we hold pitchess. 1 unless otherwise indicated, all statutory references are to the penal code. 2 pitchess v. superior court (1974) 11 cal.3d 531 (pitchess). 3 facts defendant, a convicted felon, was the passenger in a car that accelerated rapidly possession of a semi-automatic handgun. a chase ensued, which eventually resulted in a police dog al-caliber semi-the ground by a deputy. discussion i the jury found defendant had served two prior prison terms as defined in section 667.5, subdivision (b). the trial court initially imposed a sentence of four years eight months in state prison, consisting of the low term of 16 months, doubled due to a robbery conviction under the three strikes law, and one year for each prior prison term, including the robbery conviction. defense counsel then suggested it was improper to use and as a one year prior prison term enhancement. the court reconsidered and sentenced defendant to five years in prison, consisting of the midterm of two years, doubled under the three strikes law, and only one prior prison term enhancement for the non-robbery offense. defendant argues that the original sentence of four years eight months was lawful and should not have been changed. because the increased sentence was based on the trial sentence to five years was an abuse of discretion. defendant further argues trial counsel was constitutionally deficient for suggesting an invalid interpretation of the law that lead to imposition of an increased sentence. 4 the attorney general responds that the case must be remanded for resentencing, because the five-year sentence ultimately imposed by the trial court did not take into -year sentence was unauthorized as a matter of law, because the court failed to either impose or strike the robbery prior prison term. a. standard of review section 1170 affords the trial court broad discretion in selecting a term of punishment within the statutory range. (people v. wilson (2008) 164 cal.app.4th 988, 99sentencing scheme, its sentencing decision will be subject to review for abuse of discretion. (see people v. superior court (alvarez) (1997) 14 cal.4th 968, 976977 [trial court 17, subd. (b) is reviewable for abuse of discretion]; people v. russel (1968) 69 cal.2d guided and capricious, that is consistent with the letter and spirit of the law, and that is based alvarez, supra, people v. sandoval (2007) 41 cal.4th 825, 847.) licable legal standard, it has people v. millard (2009) 175 cal.app.4th 7, 31; see people v. marquez (1983) 143 cal.app.3d 797, 803-804.) where the trial court has a misunderstanding concerning the scope of the discretion, remand for people v. coelho (2001) 89 cal.app.4th 861, 889.) 5 b. analysis we conclude defendant has the better of the argument under the unusual circumstances of this case. the sentence originally announced by the trial courtfour years eight monthswas a lawful sentence. that sentence properly took into account g the robbery that was used to also double the sentence under the three strikes law. the same conviction may be used under the three strikes sentencing scheme and as a prior prison term. (people v. white eagle (1996) 48 cal.app.4th 1511, 1518; people v. cressy (1996) 47 cal.app.4th 981, 989-993.) the sentence of four years eight months would have been imposed had defense counsel not incorrectly questioned whether the trial court could use the robbery ree strikes law and as a one year state prison was increased to five years when the court mistakenly concluded, at the suggestion of defense counsel, that only one prior prison term enhancement could be imposed. resentencing under the original terms of the four-year eight-month sentence is appropriate under these circumstances. in view of our resolution of this issue under the abuse of discretion standard of review, wresulted from inadequate assistance of trial counsel. ii prison sentence. he first argues, and the attorney general properly concedes, that defendant was entitled to 332 days of presentence custody credit, rather than the 331 days awarded by the trial court. defendant next argues, based upon principles of equal protection of the law, he is entitled to one-for-one conduct credits in the amount of 332 6 days under the amendment to section 4019, applicable to crimes committed on or after october 1, 2011. at a minimum, defendant contends, he is entitled to 166 days of conduct credit, rather than the 66 days awarded by the trial court. the attorney general agrees with this latter contention. the parties are correct that defendant was entitled to 332 of presentence credit under section 2933. upon resentencing, the judgment should reflect this correct calculation of custody credits. defendant is entitled to 166 days of conduct credit but not the 332 days he claims. sentenced on august 3, 2011. at the time of his offense and sentencing, defendant was entitled under former section 4019 to six days of credit for every four days served. effective october 1, 2011, sections 4019 was amended to effectively provide one day of conduct credit for each day of custody credit. ( 4amendment providing for one-for-one credits applies only to crimes committed on or after october 1, 2011. ( 4019, subd. (h).) as a matter of statutory construction, the amendment to section 4019 is expressly not retroactive, and defendant quite properly makes no contrary argument. (see people v. brown (2012) 54 cal.4th 314, 322, fn. 11.) d largely on in re kapperman (1974) brown, supra, 54 cal.4th 314. (people v. ellis (2012) 207 cal.app.4th 1546 (ellisamicus curiae also contend the present case is controlled by in re kapperman, supra, 11 cal.3d 542, in which this court concluded that equal protection required the retroactive application of an expressly prospective statute granting credit to felons for time served in local custody before sentencing and commitment to state prison. we disagree. credit for time served is given without regard to behavior, and thus does not entail the paradoxical consequences of applying retroactively a statute intended to create incentives for good behavior. kapperman does not hold or suggest that prisoners serving time before and 7 after the effective date of a statute authorizing conduct (brown, supra, at p. 330; see ellis, supra, at p. 1552.) accordingly, defendant is entitled to 166 days of conduct credit based on 332 days of custody credit. iii defendant requests this court to independently review the record of the in camera hearing held on his motion filed under pitchess v. superior court, supra, 11 cal.3d 531. in carrying out our duty to conduct an independent review (people v. mooc (2001) 26 cal.4th 1216, 1228-1232), we issued a record correction order to have a complete record of proceedings. having reviewed the corrected record and conducted an independent review of the proceedings, we hold the trial court did not abuse its discretion in ruling on the pitchess motion. disposition the cause is remanded to the trial court with directions to vacate the five-year sentence imposed and to enter a sentence of four years eight months as originally contemplated by the trial court. the judgment shall include custody credit of 332 days and conduct credit of 166 days. in all other respects, the judgment is affirmed. kriegler, j. we concur: turner, p. j. armstrong, j.
