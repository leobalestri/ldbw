(a)(1))1 and with making criminal threats to him ( 422, subd. (a)) while personally using a dangerous or deadly weapon ( 12022, subd. (b)(1)). in separate counts, the people also charged defendant with assaulting the man and his toddler daughter with a deadly weapon. the people further charged defendant with a misdemeanor count of possessing a controlled substance (health & saf. code,  11377).2 a jury convicted defendant of all charges except assaulting the toddler, and found true the weapon enhancement. the trial court imposed a four-year prison sentence. the court used the criminal threats count involving the teen as the principal count, imposing a base term of two years plus an additional year for the weapon enhancement. the court then imposed a consecutive one-year prison sentence for the assault count against the man. the court stayed the remaining counts under section 654. defendant filed a timely appeal. 1 all further statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise indicated. 2 the people additionally charged defendant with misdemeanor trespass ( 602, subd. (m)), but the trial court dismissed the count under section 1118. 4 discussion i. sufficiency of the evidence defendant argues that there is insufficient evidence to support his assault with a deadly weapon convictions. in assessing claims, our task is to ask whether each conviction is supported by evidence that is reasonable, credible, and of solid value from which a reasonable trier of fact could find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, and we do so while viewing the record in the light most favorable to the conviction. (people v. covarrubias (2016) 1 cal.5th 838, 890.) the crime of assault with a deadly weapon has two elements: (1) the assault, and (2) the means by which the assault is committed. (people v. smith (1997) 57 cal.app.4th 1470, 1481;  245, subd. (a)(1) [defining crithe person of another with a deadly weapon or instrument other an assaul . . . to commit a violent injurpeople v. licas (2007) 41 cal.4th 362, 366-367.) although assault is colloquially referred to as an people v. wright (2002) 100 cal.app.4th 703, 706), it is not technically an attempt crime (people v. chandler (2014) 60 cal.4th 508, 516). thus, assault remains a general intent crime (people v. williams (2001) 26 cal.4th 779, 784-785 (williams); cf.  21a), and its intent requirement is satisfied if the people adduce proof that (1) the defendant willfully engaged in the conduct constituting assault, and (2) the reasonable person to realize that a battery would directly, williams, at p. 788; people v. aznavoleh (2012) 210 cal.app.4th 1181, 1190 5 assault with a deadly weapon. in both instances, defendant swung or waved the underside of a skateboardthat is, its metal tracks and wheelsfrom that vantage point, defendant had a present ability to inflithe means and location people v. chance (2008) 44 cal.4th 1164, 1174 (chance)open into two pieces,onduct with the man just a half-hour later are evidence that defendant was subjectively aware williams, supra, 26 cal.4th at p. 788.) defendant also engaged in his conduct willfully. although defendant presented evidence that he was suffering from delusions due to his ingestion of methamphetamine, his voluntary intoxication defense was confined to the criminal threats count; the defense does not apply to a general intent crime like assault with a deadly weapon. (in re v.v. (2011) 51 cal.4th 1020, 1027.) finally, the two skateboards defendant used to commit the assaults were heavy pieces of wood with metal and protruding whbe capable of producing and likely to produce, death or great [citation.]people v. aguilar (1997) 16 cal.4th 1023, 1028-1029 (aguilar); accord, people v. simons (1996) 42 cal.app.4th 1100, 1106 [screwdriver is a deadly weapon when brandished]; people v. page (2004) 123 cal.app.4th 1466, 1472 (page) [same, as to pencil].) defendant raises two challenges to the evidence. first, he argues that his threats were conditional because his threats to use force were conditioned 6 teen) or on dropping (as to the man). defendant is t which may appear conditional on its face can people v. stanfield to be met is] present, and not future, and the compliance demanded [is] people v lipscomb (1993) 17 cal.app.4th 564, 570), victim therefore had a reasonable apprehension that [the] defendant would act in acregardless of its seemingly conditional language (stanfield, at p. 1158). in this defendant demanded immediate compliance; because the teen had no way to comply given that he had no idea who sean was; and, most telling, because defendant continued to wave the skateboard and make threats even after the teen said he did not unconditional for many of the same reasonsnamely, because and because the man had no way to comply because he was unarmed.3 second, defendant asserts that his conduct was not likely to result in a batteryand thus cannot be punishable as an assaultvictims, and never touched them. he is wrong. the thrust of argument is that there can be no assault without a touching, but t 3 no occonly be held liable for committing assault by virtue of making a conditional threat if he was 7 without making actual physical contact with the person of the aguilar, supra, 16 cal.4th at p. 1028.) to the extent defendant more specifically argues that there was insufficient evidence that he had the present ability to inflict injury, we disagree because that requirement does not mean that a . . . do everything physically possible to complete (chance, supra, 44 cal.4th at p. 1175.) to the extent defendant means that there was insufficient evidence that he was the facts that would lead a reasonable person to realize that a battery would directly, naturally and williams, supra, 26 cal.4th at p. 788), the statements he made during the assaults demonstrate otherwise. ii. instructional issues jury instructions. we review instructional issues de novo. (people v. simon (2016) 1 cal.5th 98, 133.) first, defendant asserts that the trial court erred in not instructing the jury on the crime of simple assault as a lesser included offense to assault with a deadly weapon. a trial court is required to instruct on a lesser conclude that the defendant committed the lesser offense, and that he is not guilty of the greater offense. people v. whalen (2013) 56 cal.4th 1, 68, quoting people v. depriest dangerous weapon is what distinguishes the offense of assault with a deadly weapon from the lesser included offense of simple assault, rational jury have concluded that the skateboards were not a dangerous or deadly weapon when defendant swung and waved 8 themmetal tracks and wheels-side ups heads and necks? we conclude the answer is no. as a resultfound defendant guilty of assault with a deadly weapon, or not guilty at all; but it could not reasonably have found him guilty of simple assault. it follows that the trial court was not required to instruct on simple assault. (page, supra, 123 cal.app.4th at p. 1474.) second, defendant seems to suggest that the trial court erred in not giving an instruction on what a jury must find before a conditional threat is actionable as an assault. a duty to instruct on issues is contingent on whether substantial evidence supports that instruction. (see people v. brooks (2017) 2 were unconditional; as a result, there was no substantial evidence that they were conditional and no need for the trial court to instruct the jury as if they were. disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. ______________________, j. hoffstadt we concur: _________________________, acting p. j. chavez _________________________, j.* goodman * retired judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
