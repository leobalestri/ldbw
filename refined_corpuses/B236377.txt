(c)). garcia appeals. discussion garcia has failed to demonstrate prejudicial error in the absence of calcrim although the trial court instructed the jury with calcrim no. 1403 (limited garcia says the court had a sua sponte duty to instruct the jury with calcrim no. 375 (evidence of uncharged offenses to prove identity, intent, common plan, etc.) as well brandon lee.5 we disagree. 5 calcrim no. 375 provides in part: defendant committed ((another/other) offense[s]/the offense[s] of _________________ <insert description of alleged offense[s]> ) that (was/were) not charged in this case. . . . you may consider this evidence only if the people have proved by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant in fact committed the (uncharged offense[s]/act[s]). proof by a preponderance of the evidence is a different burden of proof than proof beyond a reasonable doubt. a fact is proved by a preponderance of the evidence if you conclude that it is more likely than not that the fact is true. if the people have not met this burden, you must disregard this evidence entirely. if you decide that the defendant committed the (uncharged offense[s]/act[s]), you may, but are not required to, consider that evidence for the limited purpose of deciding whether or not: . . . the defendant was the person who committed the offense[s] alleged in this case](./; or) the defendant acted with the intent to _________________ <insert specific intent required to prove the offense[s] alleged> in this case](./; or) the defendant had a motive to commit the offense[s] alleged in this case](./; or) the defendant knew _________________ <insert knowledge required to prove the offense[s] alleged> when (he/she) allegedly acted in this case](./; or) the defendant's alleged actions were the result of mistake or accident](./; or) the defendant had a plan [or scheme] to commit the offense[s] alleged in this case](./; or) the defendant reasonably and in good faith believed that ___________________ <insert name or description of complaining witness> consented](./; or) the defendant _________________ <insert description of other permissible purpose; see evid. code,  1101(b)> .] in evaluating this evidence, consider the similarity or lack of similarity 6 according to the record, garcia did not request calcrim no. 375. pursuant to calcrim no. 1403, the trial court ingang activity only for the limited purpose of deciding whether the defendant acted with the intent, purpose, and knowledge that are required to prove the gang-related enhancement charged or the defendant had a motive to commit the crimes charged. believability of a witness and when you consider the facts and information relied on by an expert witness in reaching his or her opinion. you may not consider this evidence for any other purpose. you may not conclude from this evidence that the defendant is a person of bad character or that he has as our supreme court explained in people v. milner (1988) 45 cal.3d 227, 251, people v. colliesaddle the trial court with the duty either to interrupt the testimony sua sponte to admonish the jury whenever a witness implicates the defendant in another offense, or to occasional extraordinary case in which unprotested evidence of past offenses is a dominant part of the evidence against the accused, and is both highly prejudicial and minimally relevant to any legitimate purpose. . . . but we hold that in this case, and in general, the trial court is under no duty to instruct sua sponte on the limited admissibility between the uncharged (offense[s]/ [and] act[s]) and the charged offense[s].] do not consider this evidence for any other purpose [except for the limited purpose of _________________ <insert other permitted purpose, e.g., determining the defendant's credibility> ]. do not conclude from this evidence that the defendant has a bad character or is disposed to commit crime.] if you conclude that the defendant committed the (uncharged offense[s]/ act[s]), that conclusion is only one factor to consider along with all the other evidence. it is not sufficient by itself to prove that the defendant is guilty of _________________ <insert charge[s]> [or that the _________________ <insert allegation[s]> has been proved]. the people must still prove (the/each) (charge/ [and] 7 collie, supra, 30 cal.3d 43, is equally applicable to this case which concerns past bad acts as opposed to prior criminapeople v. milner, supra, 45 cal.3d at pp. 252-252.) gang evidence is relevant and admissible when the very reason for the underlying crime, that is the motive, is gang related. [citations.] ordinarily the incentive for criminal behavior, its probative value generally exceeds its people v. valdez (2012) 55 cal.4th 82, 138, further citations omitted.) moreover, calcrim no. 1403, is neither contrary to law nor misleading. (ibid.states in no uncertain terms that gang evidence is not admissible to show that the defendant is a bad person or has a criminal propensity. it allows such evidence to be considered only on the issues germane to the gang enhancement, the motive for the crime ibid.) in this case, gang evidence was essential to although garcia was not charged with the june 2, 2007, shooting of brandon lee, he was a believed lee was involved in the 2006 incident in which shots were fired at garcia, his against garcia and mnv. because gang evidence was central to this case involving gang was appropriate. (people v. samaniego (2009) 172 cal.app.4th 1148, 1170.) involvement in the uncharged prior shooting at lee, he was nevertheless acquitted of 2including his own admissions recorded on the telephone wiretaps in addition to the testimony of green who knew garcia prior to the june 5, 2007 smart & final shooting; 8 he cannot establish prejudice in the absence of calcrim no. 375 in any event. (people v. breverman (1998) 19 cal.4th 142, 178.) of gang evidence. citing our decision in people v. albarran (2007) 149 cal.app.4th 214, garcia gang evidence rendered his trial fundamentally unfair and violated his federal due process rights. we disagree. first, as he concedes, garcia only objected to testimony characterizing him as a evidence code section 352 and did not raise any constitutional objection in the trial court. consequently, he has forfeited this claim. nized the potential prejudicial effect of gang evidence. as a result, our supreme court has condemned the introduction of such people v. cox (1991) 53 cal.3d 618, 660 [280 cal. rptr. 692, 809 p.2d 351], disapproved on other grounds in people v. doolin (2009) 45 cal.4th 390, 421, fn. 22 [87 cal. rptr. 3d 209, 198 p.3d 11].) because gang evidence creates a risk that the jury will infer that the defendant has a criminal disposipeople v. williams (1997) 16 cal.4th 153, 193 [66 cal. rptr. 2d 123, 940 p.2d 710].) ang membership is not insulated from the general rule that all relevant evidence is admissible if it is relevant to a material issue in the case other than character, is not more prejudicial than probative, and is not cumulative. (people v. avitia (2005) 127 cal.app.4th 185, 192 [24 cal. rptr. 3d 887]; see also people v. hernandez (2004) 33 cal.4th 1040, 1049 [16 cal. rptr. 3d 880, 94 people v. samaniego, supra, 172 cal.app.4th at pp. 1167-1168.) 9 as we noted in admissible when the very reason for the underlying crime, that is the motive, is gang probative value generally exceeds its prejudicial effect, and wide latitude is permitted in people v. samaniego, supra, 172 argument, gang evidence was properly admitted, the jury received calcrim no. 1403, gang evidence. (people v. breverman, supra, 19 cal.4th at p. 178; people v. gray (2005) 37 cal.4th 168, 231.) -related crime instructions did not constitute an abuse of discretion. assault with a deadly weapon under section 245 (calcrim no. 875) and/or the negligent discharge of a firearm pursuant to section 246.3 (calcrim no. 970) violated his rights to due process, to a fair trial, to present a defense, to the effective assistance of counsel and to a reliable verdict and sentence. again, we disagree. charge is not the issue. the due process part of the lesser related issues is really what the people v. kraft (2000) 23 cal.4th 978exists stating that a defendant has no right to jury instructions upon lesser related offenses, even if the instruction is supported by substantial evidence and defense counsel requests such instructkraft people v. birks (1998) 19 cal.4th 108 (birks), but also necessarily concedes our supreme court determined birks did not violate the federal constitution in people v. rundle (2008) 43 cal.4th 76. (auto equity sales, inc. v. superior court (1962) 57 cal.2d 450.) 10 in any event, where, as here, there is no evidence the offense was less than that charged, such an instruction is not warranted. (people v. moye (2009) 47 cal.4th 537, 548.) as already descrito the contrary, the jury heard evidence garcia came out of the bushes and, along with a rival gang, including green (who had attended high school with garcia in the small, tight not reasonably probable garcia would have received a more favorable verdict if the jury had been instructed on assault with a deadly weapon and negligent discharge of a firearm people v. watson (1956) 46 cal.2d 818.) to the extent garcia makes passing reference to a denial of his right to effective assistance of counsel, he fails to substantiate it, identifying neither deficient performance in order to establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, people v. ledesma (2006) 39 cal.4th 641, 745-746, an explanation and failed to provide one, or unless id. at p. 746, citations omitted.) garcia has failed to demonstrate prejudicial error. 11 status as an mnv shot caller. process, a fair trial and a reliable verdict and sentence. at trial, however, garcia objected to such evidence solely on the basis of evidence code section 352, and, citing people v. carter (2003) 30 cal.4th 1166, 1194, acknowledges admission of this type of evidence is reviewed for an abuse of which permeated the trial, he says he was prejudiced by the admission of this evidence. to the admission of gang evidence, we find no abuse of discretion. garcia has not demonstrated prejudicial error in the admission of evidence of his own pre-trial comments as to the possible length of his imprisonment. people v. holt (1984) 37 cal.3d 436, 458, he says he was prejudiced as a result because a again, garcia failed to object to the admission of this evidence and therefore forfeited this objection. (people v. dykes (2009) 46 cal.4th 731, 756.) moreover, unlike the circumstances in people v. holt, supra, 37 cal.3d 436, this case does not present a circumstance in which the prosecutor improperly referred to punishment during argument in holt(people v. gray, supra, 37 cal.4th at p. 231.) accordingly, we find no error. in any he would have received a more favorable verdict absent the admission of this evidence. (people v. holt, supra, 37 cal.3d at p. 458; people v. watson, supra, 46 cal.2d 818.) 12 of green was premeditated. ertion insufficient evidence of premeditation supports the review. criminal case is whether, on the entire record, a rational trier of fact could find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. [citations.] on appeal, we must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the people and must presume in support of the judgment the existence of every fact the trier could reasonably deduce from the evidence. [citation.] value, nonetheless it is the exclusive province of the trial judge or jury to determine the credibility of a witness and the truth or falsity of the facts on which that determination depends. [citation.] thus, if the verdict is supported by substantial evidence, we must accord due deference to the trier of fact and not substitute our evaluation people v. jones (1990) 51 cal.3d 294, people v. ochoa (1993) 6 cal.4th 1199, 1206.) o hypothesis whatsoever is people v. bolin (1998) 18 cal.4th 297, 331, citation omitted.) garcia simply argues an alternative interpretation of the facts. for example, noting none of the bullets hit green or anyone else, he speculates green did not feel his safety was in jeopardy or he and brown would have left the area and entered his as green testified, however, he had lived in monrovia, a very tight knit c13 african started. we find no error. (people v. bolin, supra, 18 cal.4th at p. 331.) according to garcia (age 22 at the time of his crime), his sentence of life with the possibility of parole, with a minimum parole eligibility of 15 years, plus a consecutive 20 years, is cruel and/or unusual in violation of our state and federal constitutions. he also says the degree of disparity is demonstrated by the disparity between his sentence and valenzuethe remaining counts dismissed), but he received a 15-year determinate sentence (the low term of five years for the attempted willful, deliberate and premeditated murder plus ten years for the gun use pursuant to section 12022.53, subdivision (b)). as the attorney general observes, the determination of whether a sentence is cruel and/or unusual does not involve the mere comparison of his sentence following trial to his fellowas convicted of committing an attempted premeditated murder. he fails to demonstrate case meeting the necessary federal standard (lockyer v. andrade (2003) 538 u.s. 63, 72; harmelin v. michigan (1991) 501 u.s. 957) or so disproportionate that it shocks the conscience and offends fundamental notions of human dignity under our supreme courtin re lynch (1972) 8 cal.3d 410, 424; people v. dillon (1983) 34 disposition the judgment is affirmed. woods, j. we concur: perluss, p. j zelon, j.
