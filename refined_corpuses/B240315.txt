defendant tried to hug lorena but she ran away. when lorena was still in third grade, the police came to the house and arrested defendant. d. rosario moved into their house. prior to that time, defendant had pulled rosario close to his body and hugged her several times. after defendant began living with rosario and her family, he tried to hug her and kiss her on the neck whenever they were alone. he also touched her legs and chest over her clothing. he tried to touch her breasts under her shirt but she fought him off. one evening, while rosario was still in fourth grade, defendant assaulted her. he covered her mouth with his hand and took her into the living room. he lay on top of her and began kissing her mouth, neck and upper chest. he touched her legs and tried to put his hand inside her shorts. rosario threatened to scream if he did not let her go. rosario kicked defendant and ran to her room. rosario locked herself in her bedroom whenever she was left alone with defendant, but he would open the door somehow. he would tell rosario to come to his room with him and she was going to like what he was going to do to her. defendant threatened rosario if she disclosed his 4 he was going to send -- he was going to call the cops on my mom and send her to mexico about the sexual abuse. the teacher called the police. the police took defendant away. e. a. in

times, defendant fondled her vagina and masturbated. on one occasion, a.d in when they were having sex. the grandmother scolded defendant and told him not to do it again or she would call the police. a. told detective smith she was afraid of defendant. iii. discussion a. uncharged acts defendant asserts the trial court abused its discretion and violated his equal protection and due process rights by admitting uncharged sex offenses evidence under evidence code section 1108, subdivision (a). defendant contends the evidence of other sexual conduct was: inflammatory; likely to motivate the jury to punish him for the uncharged acts; and too dissimilar to be probative. defendant concedes that remoteness and undue consumption of time are not at issue in this case. we find defendant forfeited this argument and, in any event, there was no abuse of discretion. defendant did not object to the uncharged acts evidence in the trial court. as a result, his argument has been forfeited. (people v. valdez (2012) 55 cal.4th 82, 130 [evid. code,  1101]; people v. miramontes (2010) 189 cal.app.4th 1085, 1099 [evid. code,  1108].) even if the issue were properly before us, we would find no abuse of section and in sections 1102, 1103, 1108, atrait of his or her character . . . is inadmissible when offered to prove his or her conduct on a specified occasion. [] (b) nothing in this section prohibits the admission of evidence that a person committed a crime, civil wrong, or other act when relevant to 7 prove some fact (such as motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, absence of mistake or accident . . . ) other than his or her disposition to commit commission of another sexual offense or offenses is not made inadmissible by section 1101, if the evidenccourt explained in people v. falsetta intended in sex offense cases to relax the evidentiary restraints section 1101, subdivision (a), imposed, evidence is per se unduly prejudicial to the defense. (see, e.g., people v. alcala (1984) 36 cal.3d 604, 630-people v. villatoro (2012) 54 propensity to commit sexual offenses is not a common attribute among the general public. therefore, evidence that a particular defendant has such a propensity is especially probative and should be considered by the trier of fact when determining the credibility people v. falsetta, supra, 21 cal.4th at p. 915.) we examine the admissibility of the uncharged offenses evidence under evidence code section 352. ( 1108, subd. (a); people v. loy (2011) 52 cal.4th 46, 63; people v. reliford (2003) 29 cal.4th 1007, 1012-court in its discretion may exclude evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the probability that its admission will (a) necessitate undue consumption of time or (b) create substantial danger of undue prejudice, of confusing the issues, or of abuse of discretion. (people v. avila (2006) 38 cal.4th 491, 578; people v. cole (2004) 8 people v. ochoa (1998) 19 cal.4th 353, 408, quoting people v. desantis people v. waidla (2000) 22 cal.4th 690, 714; accord, people v. fuiava (2012) 53 cal.4th 622, 663.) our supreme court has fur[evidence code] section 352 will be upheld on appeal unless the court abused its discretion, that is, unless it exercised its discretion in an arbitrary, capricious, or patently absurd manner. (people v. williams (2008) 43 cal.4th 584, 634635; [people v.] rodrigues [(1994)] 8 cal.4th [1060,] 1124people v. thomas (2012) 53 cal.4th 771, 806. in people v. harris (1998) 60 cal.app.4th 727, 737-741, the court of appeal for the third appellate district set forth five factors to be considered in making the evidence code sections 352 and 1108 determinations. they are the: inflammatory nature of the uncharged acts evidence; probability of confusing the jury; remoteness in time of the uncharged act or acts; consumption of time to introduce the evidence; and probative value of the evidence. (accord, people v. hernandez (2011) 200 cal.app.4th 953, 965-966; people v. branch (2001) 91 cal.app.4th 274, 282; see people v. ewoldt (1994) 7 cal.4th 380, 404-406.) similarly, in people v. falsetta, supra, 21 cal.4th at page 917, our supreme court held that in ruling on the admissibility of evidence under evidence under [evidence code] section 352. rather than admit or exclude every sex offense a defendant commits, trial judges must consider such factors as its nature, relevance, and possible remoteness, the degree of certainty of its commission and the likelihood of confusing, misleading, or distracting the jurors from their main inquiry, its similarity to the charged offense, its likely prejudicial impact on the jurors, the burden on the defendant in defending against the uncharged offense, and the availability of less prejudicial alternatives to its outright admission, such as admitting some but not all of the people v. lewis (2009) 46 cal.4th 1255, 1285, fn. 18.) 9 had an objection been interposed and overruled, we would find no abuse of discretion. the uncharged acts that m. and loren testified to were no more or less inflammatory than that described by r., b., lorena, rosario and a. defendant began to assault each victim at an early age. each of the victims, including m., described similar acts. in each case, defendant used physical force and verbal threats to achieve his abuse. he took advantage of his relationships with other family members to gain access to his victims. his sexual assaults progressed from touching over the clothing, to digital there is no likelihood the jury punished defendant for the uncharged acts. to the extent defendant raises federal constitutional claims distinct from his abuse of discretion argument, he forfeited them by failing to assert them in the trial court. (people v. riggs (2008) 44 cal.4th 248, 292; people v. partida (2005) 37 cal.4th 428, 437-merit for the same reasons we rejected his evidence code section 352 argument. our supreme court has held, t any constitutional claim is merely a gloss on the [evidence code section 352 argument], it . . . is without merit because the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the evidence. ([people v.] prince [(2007)] 40 cal.4th people v. riggs, supra, 44 cal.4th at p. 292.) b. hearsay r. [r.], we were talking about a time when [defendant] was removed from the home you shared with this other family, yes? [] a. yes. [] q. how old were you when that happened? [] a. i was 18. [] q. so how did that come about? [] a. all of a sudden i came home from school, my mom had gone and picked me up, . . . [and] my mom told me that they had taken [defendant] away. [] [deputy public defender manuel marin]: objection. hearsay. [] the court: is this offered for her state of mind only to explain her later 10 ladies and gentlemen, the evidence of what her mother told her is not offered for the truth of the content of that statement, but simply explains the later actions of this witness, r. testified defendant subsequently returned to the house, drunk and angry and insisting that he be let in. he spoke to r.admitted he had sex with r. this was the first time r. defendant argues admitting the foregoing evidence deprived him of his due process and fair trial rights. any error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. (chapman v. california (1967) 386 u.s. 18, 24; people v. mckinnon (2011) 52 cal.4th 610, 673-674.) the jury knew defendant had been arrested at least once because he was being prosecuted. moreover, b. testified defendant left the home after she called the police. lorena testified that when she was in third grade, the police came to the house and arrested defendant. rosario testified: a teacher was abuse; the teacher called the police; and the police took defendant away. a. testified a cousin called the police and reported the abuse. and loren testified she told her brother brother called the police. in light of the foregoing testimony and the overwhelming evidence of guilt, that r.defendant had been removed from the home was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. c. sentencing 1. the restitution fine defendant challenges the $5,000 restitution fine imposed under penal code section 1202.4, subdivision (b), as an impermissible increased punishment based upon judicially determined facts. he cites southern union co. v. united states (2012) 567 u.s. __ [132 s.ct. 2344]. that contention is without merit. (people v. kramis (2012) 209 cal.app.4th 346, 351-352.) the restitution fine imposed in the present case was within the statutory range. 11 2. section 667.61, subdivision (b) defendant was convicted in count 11 of, between january 1 and december 31, 1996, committing continuous sexual abuse of a child in violation of section 288.5, subdivision (a). the jury further found true the section 667.61, subdivision (e)(4) multiple victims allegation. defendant was sentenced to 15 years to life under section 667.61, subdivision (b). section 288.5, criminalizing continuous sexual abuse of a child, was enacted in 1989. (stats. 1989, ch. 1402,  4.) however, it was not an offense subject to sentencing under section 667.61, subdivision (b) until september 20, 2006. ( 667.61 as amended by stats. 2006, ch. 337,  33.) the mandatory indeterminate life sentences for repeat sex offenders under section 667.61 cannot be imposed ex post facto. (u.s. const., art. i,  10; cal. const., art. i,  9; people v. simmons (2012) 210 cal.app.4th 778, 796-797; people v. riskin (2006) 143 cal.app.4th 234, 243-245; see people v. superior court (ghilotti) (2002) 27 cal.4th 888, 933.) therefore, defendant could not lawfully be subject to a 15-year-to-life sentence on count 11. at the time defendant committed the continuous sexual abuse, in 1996, the applicable sentence was 6, 12, or 16 years. (former  288.5, subd. (a) as added by stats. 1989, ch. 1402,  4.) defendant was convicted in count 24 of sexual penetration by foreign object with a child under 14 in violation of section 289, subdivision (j). the dates of the charged offenses were between january 1 and october 31, 2003. the jury further found true the multiple victims allegation under section 667.61, subdivision (e)(4). defendant was sentenced to 15 years to life in state prison under section 667.61, subdivision (b). however, a violation of section 289, subdivision (j) is not an offense subject to sentencing under section 667.61, subdivision (b). the authorized term of imprisonment is three, six, or eight years. ( 289, subd. (j), as amended by stats. 2002, ch. 302,  5, eff. jan. 1, 2003, to sept. 8, 2010.) upon remittitur issuance, defendant is to be resentenced on these determinate terms. 12 d. the sex offense fine the trial court imposed a $500 penal code section 290.3, subdivision (a) sex offender fine. we presume the trial court determined defendant did not have the ability to pay any additional penal code section 290.3, subdivision (a) fines for his other convictions. (people v. walz (2008) 160 cal.app.4th 1364, 1371; see people v. burnett (2004) 116 cal.app.4th 257, 261-first qualifying conviction is $300, not $500. (pen. code,  290.3, subd. (a).) the judgment must be modified to impose a penal code section 290.3, subdivision (a) fine in the amount of $300 plus applicable penalty assessments. the abstract of judgment must be amended accordingly. e. the abstract of judgment prevention fee of $10.00 per pc section 1202.5, plus a penalty assessment of $28.00 plus 20% surcharge of $2.00 per pc section 1465.7, for total of $40.so order. the abstract of judgment must be modified to delete that order. (people v. zackery (2007) 147 cal.app.4th 380, 387-388; see people v. sanchez (1998) 64 cal.app.4th 1329, 1331-1332; people v. rowland (1988) 206 cal.app.3d 119, 123-124.) iv. disposition 24. upon remittitur issuance, defendant must be resentenced on these counts. the judgment is modified to impose a penal code section 290.3, subdivision (a) sex offense fine in the amount of $300 rather than $500. the amended abstract of judgment must omit any reference to a $10 fine under penal code section 1202.5, and reflect a $300 sex offense fine (pen. code,  290.3, subd. (a)), plus applicable penalty assessments. in all 13 other respects, the judgment is affirmed. upon remittitur issuance, and following resentencing, the clerk of the superior court must amend the abstract of judgment and forward it to the department of corrections and rehabilitation. not to be published in the official reports turner, p.j. we concur: kriegler, j. judge of the ventura county superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
