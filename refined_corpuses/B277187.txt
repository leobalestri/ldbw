(see pen. code,  1170.126, subd. (e)(2), 667, subd. (e)(2)(c)(iii).)1 we affirm. factual and procedural background on july 6, 1994, police officers responded to a call reporting shots fired at a bar. defendant and another man emerged from a crowd that had assembled near the scene. defendant was ordered by an officer to approach and kneel. instead, defendant, who was holding a gun, walked to the front of a nearby car and made a downward motion with his hand. he started to approach the officer, but then fled and was apprehended. a loaded .38-caliber revolver was found in the gutter next to the car. defendant was convicted of possession of a firearm by a felon (former  12021, subd. (a)(1))2 and the trial court found he had suffered two prior  667, subds. (b)-(i), 1170.12, subds. (a)-(d)). he was sentenced under the three strikes law to a term of 25 years to life. we affirmed the judgment of conviction in people v. ross (jun. 30, 1997, b104360) (nonpub. opn.) but remanded the matter to the superior court so that it could exercise 1 unless otherwise noted, all further statutory references are to the penal code. 2 former section 12021, subdivision (a)(1) was repealed as of january 1, 2012, and reenacted without substantive change as section 29800, subdivision (a)(1). (people v. sanders (2012) 55 cal.4th 731, 734, fn. 2.) for convenience and brevity, because defendant was convicted under the repealed statute, we refer to former section 12021 in this opinion as section 12021. 3 light of people v. superior court (romero) (1996) 13 cal.4th 497. following be stricken. defendant appealed again, and we affirmed. (people v. ross (oct. 6, 1999, b124142) [nonpub. opn.].) in january 2013, defendant filed a petition for recall and resentencing. the trial court denied the petition in august 2016. defendant timely appealed fr discussion under section 1170.126, subdivision (b), an inmate serving an of a felony or felonies that are not defined as serious and/or violent felonies by subdivision (c) of section 667.5 or subdivision (c) of section 1192.7, may file a limits those inmates eligible for resentencing to those sentence was not imposed for any of the offenses appearing in clauses (i) to (iii), inclusive, of subparagraph (c) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (e) of section 667 or clauses (i) to (iii), inclusive, of subparagraph (c) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (c) of section 1170.12.[d]uring the commission of the current offense, the defendant used a firearm, was armed with a firearm or deadly weapon, or intended to cause great bodily injury to another ( 667, subd. (e)(2)(c)(iii), 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(c)(iii) (hereinafter ).) the trial court here found defendant ineligible for recall and resentencing under section 1170.126 on the ground that during the commission of the offense at issue (possession of a firearm by a felon) defendant was armed with a firearm. 4 defendant argues that the trial court erred because the factors listed in nt offense as an addition and not  667, subd. (e)(2)(c)(i) [specific controlled substance offenses], (ii) [specific sex offenses], 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(c)(i), (ii)), while based on this distinction, defendant contends that if the statute were intended to exclude the offense of possession of a firearm by a felon, the offense would have been specifically enumerated. t crime. when defendant was convicted, section 12021, subdivision (a)(1) provided the state of california . . . who owns or has in his or her possession or under his or her custpeople v. osuna (2014) 225 cal.app.4th 1020, 1029-1030 (osunahas been statutorily defined and judicially construed to mean having a id. at p. 1029.) in contrast, a felon could be in possession of a firearm if the firearm was in ed. (id. at p. 1030.) here, defendant was armed (and did not merely possess a firearm) because he had a gun in his hand, making it available for offensive or defensive use. thus, based on the text of subdivision (iii), defendant was not eligible for resentencing. 5 contention. tsubdivision (iii) indicates that being armed must accompany an offense other than being a felon in possvoters rendered ineligible for resentencing not only narrowly drawn categories of third strike offenders who committed particular, specified offenses or types of offenses, but also broadly inclusive categories of offenders who, during commission of their crimesand regardless of those crimes basic statutory elementsused a firearm, were armed with a firearm or deadly weapon, or intended to cause great bodily injury to another person. significantly, however, those categories, while broad, are not unlimited. voters easily could have expressly disqualified any defendant who committed a gun-related felony or who possessed a firearm, had they wanted to do so. this is not what voters did, however.people v. blakely (2014) 225 cal.app.4th 1042, 1055 (blakely).) the blakely court examined proposition 36 ballot materials and criminals who were deserving of life sentences, and petty criminals (such as shoplifters and those convicted of simple drug possession) who posed little or id. at pp. 1056-een convicted of two or more serious and/or violent felonies in the past, and most recently had a firearm readily available for use, simply does not pose little or no risk to the publicdangerous criminal deemed ineligible for resentencing under proposition 36. (blakely, at p. 1057.) consistent with osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th 1020, 1029-1032; 6 people v. white (2014) 223 cal.app.4th 512, 524-527; blakely, supra, 225 cal.app.4th 1042, 1051-1057; people v. elder (2014) 227 cal.app.4th 1308, 1312-1314; people v. brimmer (2014) 230 cal.app.4th 782, 793-799; people v. hicks (2014) 231 cal.app.4th 275, 283-284; people v. white (2016) 243 cal.app.4th 1354, 1362-1363.) as explained in osuna(225 cal.app.4th at p. 1032.) further, defenthe holdings in people v. bland (1995) 10 cal.4th 991 and people v. pitto (2008) 43 cal.4th 228 misconstrues these opinions. neither bland nor pitto examined subdivision (iii). instead, both analyzed how a sentence specified offense applied in the context of a possessory drug offense. (bland, at p. 1002; pitto, at pp. 239-240.) as explained in pitto, the section 12022 enh(1) a defendant, while perpetrating a drug offense, knows of the presence and location of a firearm near the drugs, (2) the proximity of the gun to the drugs is not the result of mere accident or happenstance, and (3) the defendant is in a position to use the gun offensively or defensively to aid in the commission of the offensepitto, at p. 240.) this holdingrelating to the proximity of a gun to drugs for purposes of a sentence enhancementhas no relevance here. instead, the issue in this matter is whether defendant was armed with a firearm during the commission of the section 12021 offense. because as explained above, defendant not only possessed a firearm, but was armed with a firearm during the commission of the offense, the trial court properly determined defendant was ineligible for recall and resentencing under section 1170.126. 7 disposition the order denying the petition for recall and resentencing is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. goodman, j.* we concur: ashmann-gerst, acting p.j. hoffstadt, j. * retired judge of the los angeles superior court assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
