discussion we appointed counsel to represent cogburn on appeal. appointed counsel filed an opening brief pursuant to wende, supra, 25 cal.3d 436, requesting independent review of the record on appeal for arguable issues. we then notified cogburn by letter that she could submit any claim, argument or issue she wished our court to review. cogburn filed a letter brief, which we discuss next. s. specifically, she contends: - er, that her lawyer did not attempt to show that a police officers at the scene of one of her arrests had made the following statement to her: ---- has asked that her at another point in as an initial matter, wa guilty plea amounts to an admission of every element of the crime . . . people v. jones (1995) 10 cal.4th 1102, 1109, overruled on a different point in in re chavez (2003) 30 cal.4th 643, 656.) accordingly, issues going to the defendants guilt or innocence . . . are not cognizable on appeal . . . . (people v. jones, supra, 10 cal.4th at p. 1109.) of ineffective assistance of trial counsel and find no error justifying reversal. a defendant asserting a claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel has the burden to demonstrate two elements. first, the defendant must show that her trial counsel failed to act in the manner to be expected of a reasonably competent attorney acting as a diligent advocate. second, the defendant must show that it is reasonably probable that a more favorable determination would have resulted in the absence of counsels failings. (see, e.g., people v. lewis (1990) 50 cal.3d 6 262, 288; and see also strickland v. washington (1984) 466 u.s. 668.) where the record on appeal does not allow for a meaningful examination and determination as to why a counsel acted as he or she did, or does not tend to show how some different performance by counsel would have resulted in a more favorable determination for a defendant, an ineffective assistance of claim is better presented through a petition for writ of habeas corpus. (see generally people v. mendoza tello (1997) 15 cal.4th 264, 267.) to her at the time of her pleas, as well as her claims regarding preparations for the probation violation hearings, are matters not readily reviewable on the face of the record. the record either does not show the acts or omissions by defense counsel about which cogburn complains, or does not show for this reason, cogburn cannot demonstrate the elements required for relief on appeal based on a claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel. we have independently reviewed the record on appeal, and find that appointed counsel has fulfilled his duty, and that no arguable issues exist. (wende, supra, 25 cal.3d 436, people v. kelly (2006) 40 cal.4th 106.) disposition the judgments are affirmed. bigelow, p.j. we concur: rubin, j. flier, j.
