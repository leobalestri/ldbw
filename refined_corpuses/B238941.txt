(a)(1))2 and misdemeanor sexual battery ( 243.4, subd. (e)). the jury further found stewart personally inflicted great bodily injury upon arevalo during commission of the assault ( 12022.7, subd. (a)). it acquitted him of attempted robbery. stewart admitted suffering a prior serious or violent felony conviction for committing a lewd or lascivious act with a child ( 288, subd. (a), 667, subds. (a), (b)-(i), 1170.12, subds. (a)-(d)), and serving a prior prison term within the romero motion and sentenced him to a term of 14 years in prison. it imposed a restitution fine, a suspended parole restitution fine, a sexual offender fine, a court security assessment, and a criminal conviction assessment. stewart appeals. discussion 1. sufficiency of the evidence. a. standard of review. when determining whether the evidence was sufficient to sustain a criminal below to determine whether it discloses substantial evidencethat is, evidence that is reasonable, credible and of solid valuefrom which a reasonable trier of fact could find 2 all further undesignated statutory references are to the penal code. 4 people v. snow (2003) 30 cal.4th 43, 66; people v. carrington (2009) 47 cal.4th 145, 186-187.) we presume in support of the judgment the existence of every fact the trier of fact could reasonably deduce from the evidence. (people v. medina (2009) 46 cal.4th 913, 919.) reversal is (people v. bolin (1998) 18 cal.4th 297, 331; people v. zamudio (2008) 43 cal.4th 327, 357.) the same standard applies when the conviction is based primarily upon circumstantial evidence. (zamudio, at p. 357; people v. valdez (2004) 32 cal.4th 73, 104.) b. as noted, the jury found stewart personally inflicted great bodily injury upon arevalo during commission of the assault. as a result, his sentence was enhanced by three years. ( 12022.7, subd. (a).) he contends the evidence was insufficient to section 12022.7. we disagree. people v. cross (2008) 45 cal.4th 58, 63; people v. washington (2012) 210 cal.app.4th 1042, 1047-1048; people v. escobar (1992) 3 cal.4th 740, 749-750.) to be considered significant or substantial, the injury need not cause permanent, prolonged, or protracted disfigurement, impairment, or loss of bodily function. (escobar, a substantial injury beyond that inherent in the people v. le (2006) 137 cal.app.4th 54, 59; escobar, at pp. 746-747, such as lacerations, bruiswashington, at p. 1047; people v. jung (1999) 71 cal.app.4th people v. cross, supra, 45 cal.4th at p. 66, fn. 3.) 5 the determination of whether a victim has suffered physical harm amounting to stion of law for the court but a factual inquiry to be people v. cross, supra, 45 cal.4th at p. 64.) if there bound to accept it, even though the circumstances might reasonably be reconciled with a people v. escobar, supra, 3 cal.4th at p. 750.) applying these principles here, the evidence, while not overwhelming, was sufficient. actual injury is not an element of assault with force likely to produce great bodily injury. (people v. aguilar (1997) 16 cal.4th 1023, 1028; people v. griggs (1989) 216 cal.app.3d 734, 739-inherent in the offense itself. relying on language in escobar, stewart argues that to fall with the crime, but [must] reflect a degree of brutality and violence substantially beyond a relevant consideration for the jury. however, we do not understand escobar to have held that such a circumstance is required, nor does the statute suggest such an element. all that is necessary is that the injury is beyond that inherent in the offense itself. (see people v. escobar, supra, 3 cal.4th at pp. 746-749.) swollen, the arrived. fire department personnel examined her for 15 to 20 minutes and treated her with an ice pack. once home, she applied cold meat to the injury. photographs of the sheriff, who observed that her eye was swollen, red, and discolored minutes after the incident. when arevalo spoke with the deputy, she was holding her eye, was crying, and complained of pain. her eye remained black and blue for two to three weeks. she had headaches for approximately two weeks as a result of the blow. this evidence was sufficient to prove great bodily injury within the meaning of section 12022.7. (see 6 people v. washington, supra, 210 cal.app.4th at p. 1047; people v. jaramillo (1979) 98 cks was sufficient to establish section 12022.7 enhancement]; people v. sanchez (1982) 131 cal.app.3d 718, 734 [multiple abrasions, lacerations, and bruises on back and neck, and swollen and bruised eye and cheek, constituted great bodily injury]; people v. escobar, supra, 3 cal.4th at pp. 744-745, 752 [multiple bruises and abrasions, stiff neck, and severe vaginal soreness were sufficient to prove section 12022.7 enhancement].) stewart argues that because arevalo did not suffer broken bones, bleeding, cuts, scarring, loss of consciousness, or permanent damage, and failed to seek medical care, consideration, none required a finding that, as a matter of law, the evidence was insufficient. (see people v. wade (2012) 204 cal.app.4th 1142, 1150 [great bodily injury does not require a finding that the injury necessitated medical treatment]; people v. lopez (1986) 176 cal.app.3d 460, 463-465 & fn. 5 [great bodily injury finding was supported by the evidence despite the fact the victims did not seek medical treatment]; cf. people v. cross, supra, 45 cal.4th at pp. 65-66 [medical complications not required to divide an injury from being cross, at p. 64; people v. escobar, supra, 3 cal.4th at p. 752.) stewa cannot say, as a matter of law, that the juevidence. people v. martinez (1985) 171 cal.app.3d 727 and people v. duke (1985) 174 cal.app.3d 296, cited by stewart, are distinguishable. in martinez, the evidence was insufficient to support a great bodily injury enhancement where the victimwho was suffered a minor martinez, at pp. 735-736.) the 7 prosecutor at trial agreed the evidence was insufficient and requested that the court strike the allegation. (id. at pp. 735-736; see also people v. le, supra, 137 cal.app.4th at and dizziness, and had a black eye and headaches for at least two weeks. in duke, the defendant was charged with assault with force likely to produce great bodily injury after he accosted an employee in an unoccupied office, grabbed her around the neck in a headlock, and touched her breasts through her sweater. (people v. duke, supra, 174 cal.app.3d at pp. id. at p. 302.) the question before the court was the sufficiency of the evidence to support the charged crime, not a great bodily injury enhancement. duke concluded the headlock did not grabbed [the victim] momentarily and released hid. at p. 303.) duke thus considered a factual situation distinguishable from that in the case at bar. in any event, the injury suffered by the victim in dukea small cut to her ear caused by an earringis far less severe than the black eye at issue here, the effects of which lingered for weeks. the evidence was sufficient. c. the evidence was sufficient to support the misdemeanor sexual battery conviction. stewart next contends the evidence was insufficient to prove he was the person who committed the sexual battery. again, we disagree. misdemeanor sexual battery (in violation of  243.4, subd. (e)) requires a showing that the defendant touched an intimate part of another person, the touching was people v. king (2010) 183 cal.app.4th 1281, 1319; people v. 8 smith (2010) 191 cal.app.4th 199, 207.)3 ( whether accomplished directly, through the clothing of the person committing the ( 243.4, subd. (e)(2).) stewart does not dispute that the evidence was sufficient to establish the foregoing elements of the offense. however, he urges that there was insufficient evidence he was the perpetrator. he complains that the train was crowded and arevalo was surrounded by numerous passengers. she did not actually see who grabbed her, but simply assumed he was the culprit. stewart argues that in order to find him guilty, the jury must have to the contrary, the evidence was sufficient. the evidence showed stewart sat next to arevalo on the orange line bus. he persisted in talking to her during the 10-minute ride to the metro station, even though arevalo did not speak english and ignored him. when she hurried to the subway train, a three-minute walk, stewart followed, entered the same train car, and stood within a few feet of her. when arevalo was grabbed, she immediately turned and found herself face-to-face with stewart. he then tugged at her purse, from a distance of approximately 20 inches away. from these facts, a reasonable jury could readily infer that stewart was the culprit. his unusual interest in arevalo, coupled with his persistence in following her onto the crowded train and positioning himself close to her, provided strong circumstantial evidence he was the assailant. his conduct when confrontedgrabbing at her purse and punching herwas inconsistent with innocence. there was no evidentiary deficit. 3 touches an intimate part of another person, if the touching is against the will of the person touched, and is for the specific purpose of sexual arousal, sexual gratification, or sexual 9 2. the trial court did noromero motion. at sentencing, stewart moved to strike his 1993 conviction for commission of a lewd act upon a child under 14, on the ground it was temporally remote. the people countered that stewart had a long history of predatory behavior against young women, and therefore did not fall outside the spirit of the three strikes law. after considering the striking of a strike imposing sentence, that stewart had a record of violence and had inflicted emotional performance on probation underlying facts of his past convictions, suggest that he does present a risk of danger to the community, pa stewart contends the trial court abused its discretion by denying his romero motion. in the furtherance of justice, a trial court may strike or dismiss a prior conviction allegation. ( 1385; people v. superior court (romero), supra, 13 cal.4th at p. 504; people v. meloney conviction allegation is reviewed under the deferential abuse of discretion standard. (people v. carmony (2004) 33 cal.4th 367, 375.) under that standard, the party seeking (people v. superior court (alvarez) (1997) 14 cal.4th 968, 977.) it is not enough to show that reasonable people might disagree about whether to strike a prior conviction. (carmony, at p. 378.) only extraordinary circumstances justify a finding that a career criminal is outside the three strikes law. (ibidreasonable people could disagree that the criminal falls outside the spirit of the three ibid.) when considering whether to strike prior convictions, the relevant factors a court the nature and circumstances of his present 10 felonies and prior serious and/or violent felony convictions, and the particulars of his spirit, in whole or in part, and hence should be treated as though he had not previously people v. williams norm, it carefully circumscrib . . . . [t]he law creates a strong presumption that any sentence that conforms to these people v. carmony, supra, 33 cal.4th at p. 378.) the record before us reveals no basis for the conclusion that stewart falls outside october 1992 he was charged with kidnapping and was convicted of false imprisonment with violence, apparently as the result of a plea bargain. according to a 1992 probation report, in that incident stewart pulled a 13-year-old girl who was waiting for a bus into his car, drove off with her, and insisted that she disrobe. she escaped by jumping from the vehicle. fortunately, stewart was apprehended when a retired deputy sheriff observed the incident and followed him. in november 1993, stewart was convicted of committing a lewd or lascivious act with a child under 14 years of age, and sentenced to three years in prison. in that incident, he engaged in a sexual relationship with a 13-year-old girl and allegedly raped her on one occasion. after his initial parole he was returned to prison twice, in february 1996 and july 1997, for parole violations. in 1995, stewart was convicted of contributing to the delinquency of a minor and grand theft of a vehicle, and was placed on probation. in that incident, officers discovered stewart inside a stolen rental car with a 13-year-old girl. in 2005, stewart was convicted of carrying a concealed dirk or dagger and sentenced to two years in prison. as the probation report explained, 38-year--social behavior over a nineteen-year period. . . . the defendant has had numerous state prison commitments and a return to state prison for parole violations. . . . [] . . . he is viewed as a serious and dangerous threat to the community, based on his involvement in the 11 present offense, and his criminal hiperiod of aberrant behavior. (cf. people v. garcia (1999) 20 cal.4th 490, 503.) his -door career criminal for whom the three strikes law was people v. gaston (1999) 74 cal.app.4th 310, 320; people v. pearson (2008) 165 cal.app.4th 740, 749.) stewart argues that his strike prior was remote in time, having been suffered in 1993, when he was 21 years old. however, the fact a prior is somewhat remote has little suffering the prior conviction. (people v. pearson, supra, 165 cal.app.4th at p. 749; people v. williams, supra, 17 cal.4th at p. 163; people v. humphrey (1997) 58 cal.app.4th 809, 813 [20-year-old felony conviction was not a mitigating factor given largely due to the fact he was incarcerated for a considerable portion of the intervening period. stewart also contends that his conduct in the instant crime was not egregious. he and points out that he denied committing the sexual battery. this characterization of the facts, of course, was rejected by the jury. as we have explained, the injury was not insignificant. nor was sfollowed and sexually battered a young woman. the 23-year-old victim was under five feet tall, weighed approximately other hand, is a target a much smaller, young-looking victim is especially troubling in light of his prior finally, stattended college, had previously been employed in a variety of jobs, and attends church 12 circumstances is meritless. we presume the trial court considered all the relevant factors in the absence of an affirmative record to the contrary.
