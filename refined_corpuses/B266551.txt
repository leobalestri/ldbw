filed 5/4/16 p. v. jones ca2/1 not to be published in the official reports california rules of court, rule 8.1115(a), prohibits courts and parties from citing or relying on opinions not certified for publication or ordered published, except as specified by rule 8.1115(b). this opinion has not been certified for publication or ordered published for purposes of rule 8.1115. in the court of appeal of the state of california second appellate district division one the people, plaintiff and respondent, v. willie lee jones, defendant and appellant. b266551 (los angeles county super. ct. no. ma056827) appeal from an order of the superior court of los angeles county, christopher estes, judge. affirmed. athena shudde, under appointment by the court of appeal, for defendant and appellant. kamala d. harris, attorney general, gerald a. engler, chief assistant attorney general, lance e. winters, senior assistant attorney general, mary sanchez and andrew s. pruitt, deputy attorneys general, for plaintiff and respondent. 2 on may 31, 2013, a jury convicted willie lee jones (jones) of transportation/sale of a controlled substance in violation of health and safety code section 11352, subdivision (a), and possession for sale of cocaine base, in violation of health and safety code section 11351.5. jones admitted to five prior prison term allegations under penal code section 667.5, subdivision (b).1 on june 14, 2013, the trial court struck one of the five allegations, and sentenced jones to nine years in state prison, consisting of the upper term of five years for the transportation/sale count, and one year for each of the four remaining prior prison terms. on july 20, 2015, jones filed a motion for resentencing (motion) asking the trial court to strike one of the four prior prison term enhancements, case no. pa052585, in which jones had been convicted in 2005 of felony possession of a controlled substance in violation of health and safety code section 11350, subdivision (a). jones represented that in april 2015, the los angeles superior court had redesignated his felony conviction in case no. pa052585 to a misdemeanor pursuant to proposition 47 ( 1170.18, subd. (a)). as that conviction was no longer a felony, jones argued it could not serve as the basis for a one-year prior prison term enhancement, and the trial court therefore should reduce his sentence by one year. in opposition, the people argued that the reduction to a misdemeanor did not affect the enhancement, as section 667.5, subdivision (b) was premised on the prior prison term and punished recidivism, rather than the nature of the prior conviction. at the once the prior felony conviction had been reduced tl the purpose of imposing the one-year prior prison term enhancement ent to prison on a misdemeanor. that condition precedent of ). the district attorney rejoined that the one-year prior . . . was a felony at the time that the defendant was sentenced to that additional time noting that no published opinions then dealt with the issue, the court 1 all further statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise indicated. 3 he underlying offense resulting in that prior prison term, the [section] 667.5[, subdivision] (b), is now a misdemeanor under pposition that does not change the validity of the enhancement, because the [section] 667.5[, subdivision] accounting for recidivist conduct.

[t]he court does not see anything in the language of prop. 47 that would intend to nullify the [section] 667.5 recidivist on august 21, 2015, and he filed this timely appeal. proposition 47, enacted by the voters in november 2014, added section 1170.18, which provides in subdivision (a)conviction . . . of a felony . . . who would have been guilty of a misdemeanor under the act . . . had this act been in effect at the time of the offense may petition for a recall of sentence . . . to request resentencing in accordance with section[] 11350 . . . of the health and safety code . . . ction under section 11350 is one of - and theft-related offenses . . .

(people v. lynall (2015) 233 cal.app.4th 1102, 11081109.) any felony 5 conviction in case no. pa052585, is recalled and resentenced . . . shall be considered a misdemeanor for all purposes( 1170.18, subd. (k).) jones argues that all purposes means the reduction of his 2005 conviction to a misdemeanor in 2015 applies retroactively to his 2013 sentence, and requires the court to strike the prior prison term enhancement. all the cases considering this issue have concluded to the contrary. not create a mechanism for obtaining a resentencing on a felony not affected by proposition 47 just because an offense underlying one of ipeople v. williams (2016) 4 245 cal.app.4th 458, 466; people v. ruff (2016) 244 cal.app.4th 935, 943; people v. carrea (2016) 244 cal.app.4th 966, terms are based on the , and not on the underlying criminal conduct, or the act or omission, giving rise to the current conviction.ruff, at pp. 945946.) proposition 47 was such as enhancements resulting from recidivism considered serious enough to warrant prospectively only. (id. at p. 946; williams, at p. 466; carrea, at pp. 973974.) reduction of his 2005 conviction to a misdemeanor under proposition 47, obtained in 2015, does not apply retrospectively to require the trial court to strike the one-year prior prison term enhancement the court imposed in 2013. disposition the order is affirmed. not to be published. johnson, j. we concur: rothschild, p. j. chaney, j.
