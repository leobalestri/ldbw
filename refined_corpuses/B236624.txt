filed 12/4/12 p. v. medina ca2/2 not to be published in the official reports california rules of court, rule 8.1115(a), prohibits courts and parties from citing or relying on opinions not certified for publication or ordered published, except as specified by rule 8.1115(b). this opinion has not been certified for publication or ordered published for purposes of rule 8.1115. in the court of appeal of the state of california second appellate district division two the people, plaintiff and respondent, v. claudia medina, defendant and appellant. b236624 (los angeles county super. ct. no. la067691) the court:* claudia medina appeals from the judgment entered upon her conviction by jury of second degree robbery. (pen. code,  211.)1 the trial court found to be true the allegations that appellant had suffered a prior felony strike ( 1170.2, subds. (a)-(d), 667, subds. (b)-(i)), and a prior serious felony ( 667, subd. (a)(1)). the trial court sentenced appellant to 15 years in state prison, consisting of the upper term of five years, doubled as a second strike, plus the five-year serious felony enhancement. the trial court struck the two prior prison term enhancements. * doi todd, acting p. j., ashmann-gerst, j., chavez, j. 1 all further statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise indicated. 2 the convictions in this case arose from the following facts: on april 16, 2011, 15-year-old clarisa e. (clarisa) was selling fruit from her side. she approached the stand and told clarisa to hand over the money. appellant held something wrapped in a blue and white striped shirt, which clarisa believed was the tip of a gun. frightened, clarisa gave appellant approximately $200 that was in her pocket. appellant returned to the car and sped away. clarisa later identified appellant as the robber in a photographic six-pack and at the preliminary hearing. we appointed counsel to represent appellant on appeal. after examination of the record, counsel fi2012, we advised appellant that she had 30 days within which to personally submit any contentions or issues which she wished us to consider. on july 23, 2012, a letter brief from appellant to this court was filed by her assistance of counsel because her attorney failed to (a) make a romero2 motion regarding her prior convictions which were eight years old, the result of a plea, and for which she was at a liquor store when the robbery happened, as reflected in a store video recording, (c) present evidence that the victim improperly identified appellant, (d) present a two-year offer to the district attorney as requested by appellant, and (e) call witnesses appellant requested, (2) the prosecution witness changed her testimony from the statements she had given, (3) appellant was misidentified, and one witness did not notice her very noticeable tattoos, and (4) she was prejudiced by the jury seeing her shackled ontentions are without references to the record on appeal and without citation of authority. points asserted on appeal without 2 people v. superior court (romero) (1996) 13 cal.4th 497 (romero). 3 authority, citations to the record or argument may be treated as forfeited and passed on without being considered. (people v. wilkinson (2004) 33 cal.4th 821, 846, fn. 9; people v. stanley (1995) 10 cal.4th 764, 793; stockinger v. feather river community college merit. ssistance of counsel claims are rejected (claim nos. 1 (a)-(e), above). presumption that coun-guess reasonable, if difficult, -making must be evaluated in the people v. jones (2003) 29 cal.4th 1229, 1254.) decisions not to call certain witnesses are peculiarly matters of trial tactics. (people v. bolin (1998) 18 cal.4th 297, 334.) the wide range of professional competence be explained as a matter of sound trial strategy. (strickland v. washington (1984) 466 u.s. 668, 689; in re andrews (2002) 28 cal.4th 1234, 1253.) if the record on appeal sheds no light on why counsel acted or failed to act in the manner challenged, an appellate claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must be rejected unless counsel was asked for an explanation and failed to provide one, or there simply could be no satisfactory explanation. (people v. mendoza tello (1997) 15 cal.4th 264, 266.) in such circumstances, a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is more appropriately made in a petition for writ of habeas corpus. (people v. visciotti (1992) 2 cal.4th 1, 47, fn. 17.) here, the record fails to omissions. the record also fails to indicate that a request was made of counsel for an explanation of reasons for the challenged actions and omissions, and those actions and 4 omissions do not appear to be such that no satisfactory explanation could be given. actions were deficient. furthermore, these claims are more appropriately brought in a petition for writ of habeas corpus. shackles and prison garb (claim no. 4, above). appellant fails to refer to any portion of the record, nor have we found any, wherein any objection was made to her wearing prison clothes or being shackled. had she promptly brought this concern to the trial precluded any ameliorating action. the failure to object to the physical restraint procedure in the trial court bars appellate review. (see people v. marks (2003) 31 cal.4th 197, 224.) an objection in the trial court must be timely to preserve the issue for appeal. (people v. ray (1967) 252 cal.app.2d 932, 975.) even if appellant had not forfeited this claim, it is nonetheless without merit. the trial court offered appellant the opportunity to wear civilian clothes. we have been pointed to no portion of the record where there is any indication of why, or if, she failed to do so. further the record provides no evidence of whether the shackles were visible to the jury at any time or if any prejudice resulted from their use. be subjected, before conviction, to any more restraint than is necessary for his detention to answer the charge.ere was discussion that appellant had been in a physical altercation with prison staff and extra she presented a serious risk to court personnel. in people v. duran (1976) 16 cal.3d 282 (duranphysical restraints of any kind in the courtroom unless there is a showing of a manifest need for such restraints. . . . id. at pp. 290291; italics added.) 5 identification evidence was imperfect, we perceive no grounds to overturn the verdict. these facts were before the jury, which evaluated any discrepancies in identifying determination. we have examined the entire recfully complied with her responsibilities and that no arguable issues exist. (people v. wende (1979) 25 cal.3d 436, 441.) the order under review is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports.
