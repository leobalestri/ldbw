(a)(1)), one prior serious or violent felony conviction aw ( 667, subds. (b)-(i), 1170.12, subds. (a)-(d)), and three prior prison terms ( 667, subd. (b)). following trial, a jury convicted defendant of count one and acquitted him of the two criminal threats counts. defendant was sentenced to three years in county jail.2 the trial court also imposed a $900 restitution fine, a $30 criminal conviction assessment, and an $40 court operations fine. defendant timely appealed.3 his sole argument on appeal is that, pursuant to people v. dueas (2019) 30 cal.app.5th 1157, 11631173 (dueas), the trial court erred in imposing the criminal conviction assessment (gov. code,  70373), the court operations assessment ( 1465.8), and the restitution fine ( 1202.4) without first determining that defendant is able to pay right to due process. in 1 all further statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise indicated. 2 the parties briefs erroneously provide that defendant was sentenced to prison. 3 while this appeal was pending, defendant filed a motion to vacate certain fines with the trial court. on july 17, 2019, the trial court denied his motion. 3 and until the people can show that he has the present ability to we affirm request to stay the restitution fine. discussion as defendant concedes in his opening brief, he did not object to the assessments or fines in the trial court. thus, he has forfeited his claim on appeal. even before dueas, a trial court capplicable here. ( 1202.4, subds. (b)(1), (c).) defendant did not object or otherwise present any evidence regarding his ability to pay to the trial court at sentencing. as a result, the issue has been forfeited on appeal. (see, e.g., people v. gibson (1994) 27 cal.app.4th 1466, 14681469; people v. bipialaka (2019) 34 cal.app.5th 455, 464 [by failing to object to fees or fines in the trial court, the defendant forfeited his objection on appeal]; people v. frandsen (2019) 33 cal.app.5th 1126, 11531155.) objection would have been futile. tatutory provisions mandate the assessments be imposed, nothing in the record of the sentencing hearing indicates that [defendant] was foreclosed from making the same request that the defendant in dueas made in the face of those same mandatory assessments. [defendant] plainly could have made a record had his ability to pay actually been an issue. indeed, [defendant] was obligated to create a record showing his inability to pay the maximum restitution fine, which would have served to also address his abilpeople v. frandsen, supra, 33 cal.app.5th at p. 1154.) 4 description of dueas the law . . . .people v. frandsen, supra, 33 cal.app.5th at p. 1154.) dueas id. at p. 1154.) argument fails on the merits. based on the constitutional guarantees of due process and ban against excessive fines, dueas held that trial courts may not impose three of the standard criminal assessments and finesnamely, the $30 court operations assessment ( 1465.8), the $40 criminal conviction assessment (gov. code,  70373), and the $900 restitution fine ( 1202.4)without dueas, supra, 30 cal.app.5th at pp. 1164, 1171, fn. 8.) we need not decide whether we agree with dueas because defendant is not entitled to a remand even if we accept dueas. that is because the record in this case, unlike the record in dueas, indicates that defendant has the ability to pay the assessments and fines imposed in this case. according to his reply brief, defendant may have had the opportunity to work during his incarceration. even if he did not, he has since been released from jail, and defendant directs us to no evidence that he cannot obtain work in order to pay the fines assessed. (people v. gamache (2010) 48 cal.4th 347, 409 [defendant evidence in the record supporting his [present or future] inability ].) while defendant may have been unemployed at the time of his arrest on august 8, 2017, there is no indication that he will remain unemployed. and defendant offers no evidence or argument in support of his suggestion that his sight impairment will impede his ability to gain any sort of employment. 5 it follows that wrestitution fine must be stayed unless and until the people prove he has a present ability to pay.4 disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. _______________________, acting p. j. ashmann-gerst we concur: ________________________, j. chavez ________________________, j. hoffstadt 4 in so concluding, we note that defendant offers no legal authority in support of his suggestion that because he was represented by appointed counsel at trial, he necessarily cannot afford to pay the court-ordered fines. in fact, the law holds otherwise.
