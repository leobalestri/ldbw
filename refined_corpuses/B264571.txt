(a)); count 2, vandalism with over $400 in damage (pen. code,  594, subd. (a)); and count 3, recklessly causing fire to an inhabited structure (pen. code,  452, subd. (b)). on may 11, 2015, the trial court sentenced buchwitz to seven years on count 1 and to a consecutive one year on count 3. the court imposed a three-year term under health and safety code section 11370.2, subdivision (b), based on a prior conviction for violating health and safety code section 11383.5. the court also imposed a one-year term for a prison prior. the court imposed but stayed, under penal code section 654, the total sentence was 12 years in prison. contentions buchwitz contends i. his sentence on count 3 for recklessly causing a fire to an inhabited structure should have been stayed under penal code section 654, and ii. his three-year sentence under health and safety code section 11370.2 was unauthorized. 4 discussion i. penal code section 654. buchwitz contends that his sentence for recklessly causing a fire to an inhabited structure should have been stayed under penal code section 654. we agree. penal code section 654, subdivision (a), provides that an act or omission punishable in different ways by different provisions of law shall be punished under the provision that provides for the longest potential term of imprisonment, but not under more than one provision. the section thus bars multiple punishments for offenses arising out of a single occurrence where all were incident to an indivisible course of conduct or a single objective. (people v. correa typically whether a defendancomprised a divisible transaction which could be punished under more than one statute within the meaning of section people v. jones punishment for a people v. mckinzie (2012) 54 cal.4th 1302, 1368, abrogated on other grounds by people v. scott (2015) 61 cal.4th 363, 391, fn. 3; people v. galvez (2011) 195 cal.app.4th 1253, 1262.) whether a course of criminal conduct is divisible depends on the objective. (people v. jones (2002) 103 cal.app.4th 1139, 1143.) if all the offenses were merely incidental to, or were the means of accomplishing one objective, the defendant may be found to have harbored a single intent and therefore may be punished only once. (people v. capistrano (2014) 59 cal.4th 830, 885; people v. sok (2010) 181 cal.app.4th 88, 99-100.) but if the defendant harbored multiple or simultaneous objectives, independent of and not merely incidental to each other, the defendant may be punished for each violation committed in pursuit of each objective even though the violations share common acts or were parts of an otherwise indivisible course of conduct. (jones, supra, 103 cal.app.4th at p. 1143; sok, at p. 99.) whether penal code section 654 applies is a question of fact for the trial court, and its findings will not be reversed on appeal if there is any substantial evidence to 5 support them. (people v. capistrano, supra, 59 cal.4th at p. 886; people v. jones, supra, 103 cal.app.4th at p. 1143.) objective for each offense will be upheld on appeal if supported by substantial evidence.1 (people v. mckinzie, supra, 54 cal.4th at p. 1368.) there is no evidence buchwitz harbored separate intents and objectives in connection with the two offenses. rather, the evidence is buchwitz rented a room at the galaxy motel. a flash fire occurred in the room when he sent butane gas through a bottle containing marijuana. what ignited the butane gas is unknown; it could have been static electricity or someone lighting a cigarette. there is no evidence that buchwitz intended to start a fire, which the people concede. indeed, successfully manufacturing butane honey oil depends on not starting a fire. buchwitz therefore recklessly caused a fire while trying to manufacture butane honey oil on a single occasion at the galaxy motel. the crimes were incident to his sole objective of manufacturing butane honey oil. (cf. people v. kurtenbach (2012) 204 cal.app.4th 1264, 1290 [where the collateral damage occurred to , the crimes of arson and vandalism were incident to one objective and pen. code,  654 applied].) ii. the three-year sentence under health and safety code section 11370.2 must be stricken. health and safety code section 11370.2 provides for a three-year sentence enhancement for any person with certain prior convictions. convicted of a violation of . . . [section 11379.6] . . . shall receive, in addition to any other punishment authorized by law . . . a full, separate, and consecutive three-year term for each prior felony conviction of . . . section 11351, 11351.5, 11352, 11378, 11378.5, (health & saf. code,  11370.2, subd. (b).) the court imposed the three-year sentence enhancement based on buch 1 the trial court here made no specific finding of a separate intent and objective. 6 safety code section 11383.5, however, is not one of the listed prior convictions that may ce for his current conviction of health and safety code section 11379.6. the three-year term must therefore be stricken. disposition the judgment is modified to stay, under penal code section 654, the one-year sentence imposed on count 3. the three-year term imposed under health and safety code section 11370.2 is also stricken. the clerk of the superior court is directed to modify the abstract of judgment and to forward the modified abstract to the department of corrections and rehabilitation. as modified, the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports aldrich, j. we concur: edmon, p. j. lavin, j.
