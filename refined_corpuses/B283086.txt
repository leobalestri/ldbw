(a)(1), (d), 1170.12, subd. (b)). the court granted croakerromero motion3 and struck his prior conviction. it sentenced him to six years four months in prison, and imposed a restitution fine, a suspended parole revocation restitution fine, a court operations assessment, and a criminal conviction assessment. croaker appeals. discussion the trial court did not err by failing to instruct on attempted criminal threats; omission of the instruction was harmless when discussing the jury instructions, the trial court advised that it had determined no instruction on any lesser included offense was appropriate. the court explained there was no evidence santana was not in sustained fear. defense counsel did not object or request an instruction on attempted criminal threats. croaker now argues that because there was evidence reasonable, the trial court prejudicially erred by failing to sua 1 the criminal threats conviction was based on the threats croaker made during the afternoon incident. the trial court properly gave a unanimity instruction. 2 all further undesignated statutory references are to the penal code. 3 people v. superior court (romero) (1996) 13 cal.4th 497. 6 sponte instruct on the lesser included offense of attempted criminal threats. we disagree. 1. applicable legal principles a trial court must instruct the jury on all general principles of law relevant to the issues raised by the evidence, including lesser included offenses, even absent a request. (people v. smith (2013) 57 cal.4th 232, 239.) instruction on a lesser included offense is required when there is evidence the defendant is guilty of the lesser offense, but not the greater. (people v. whalen (2013) 56 cal.4th 1, 68.) substantial evidence is evidence that a reasonable jury could find persuasive. (people v. williams (2015) 61 cal.4th 1244, 1263.) the existence of any evidence, no matter how weak, will not justify instructions on a lesser included offense. (people v. whalen, at p. 68.) in determining whether substantial evidence existed, we do not evaluate the credibility of the witnesses, a task for the jury. (people v. wyatt (2012) 55 cal.4th 694, 698.) we independently review the question of whether the trial court erred by failing to instruct on a lesser included offense. (people v. trujeque (2015) 61 cal.4th 227, 271; people v. brothers (2015) 236 cal.app.4th 24, 30.) to prove a violation of section 422, the prosecution must establish that: (1) the defendant willfully threatened to commit a crime which would result in death or great bodily injury to another person; (2) the defendant made the threat with the specific intent that the statement would be taken as a threat, even if he or she did not intend to carry it out; (3) on its face and under the circumstances, the threat was so unequivocal, unconditional, immediate, and specific as to convey to the victim a gravity of purpose and immediate prospect of execution; (4) the threat actually caused the victim to be in sustained fear for his or 7 her own safety; and (5) ble under the circumstances. (people v. toledo (2001) 26 cal.4th 221, 227228; in re george t. (2004) 33 cal.4th 620, 630; people v. orloff (2016) 2 cal.app.5th 947, 953.) thus, the sustained feahas a subjective and an objective component. a victim must actually be in sustained fear, and the sustained fear must also be reasonable under the circumstances. (in re ricky t. (2001) 87 cal.app.4th 1132, 1140; people v. jackson (2009) 178 cal.app.4th 590, 596.) that continuing over a period of time that extends beyond what is momen (in re ricky t., at p. 1140; people v. solis (2001) 90 cal.app.4th 1002, 10151016.) fifteen minutes has been held to be a sustained period for purposes of section 422. (people v. wilson (2015) 234 cal.app.4th 193, 201; people v. fierro (2010) 180 cal.app.4th 1342, 1349; people v. allen (1995) 33 cal.app.4th 1149, 1156.) the totality of the circumstances, inclu and the manner in which the communication was made, are relevant to prove the elements of the offense. (people v. wilson (2010) 186 cal.app.4th 789, 808; in re ryan d. (2002) 100 cal.app.4th 854, 860; people v. butler (2000) 85 cal.app.4th 745, 753754; people v. solis, at p. 1013.) attempted criminal threats is a lesser included offense of making criminal threats. (people v. chandler (2014) 60 cal.4th 508, 513; people v. toledo, supra, 26 cal.4th at pp. 226, 230; in re sylvester c. (2006) 137 cal.app.4th 601, 607.) it occurs when, for example, a written threat is intercepted before it reaches the intended victim, or the victim does not understand the threat, or for some reason is not placed in sustained fear. (see people v. 8 chandler, at p. 515; people v. toledo, at p. 231.) to prove attempted criminal threats, the people must prove the defendant harbored a subjective intent to threaten, and that the intended threat, under the circumstances, was objectively threatening, that is, was sufficient to cause a reasonable person to be in sustained fear. (people v. chandler, at pp. 511, 525.) 2. application here we discern no prejudicial instructional error in the instant matter. we doubt that there was substantial evidence to support an attempted criminal threats instruction. there was ample evidence fear was reasonable. (see generally people v. orloff, supra, 2 cal.app.5th at p. 953 reasonable although threat was made over the phone, by a defendant who was confined to a wheelchair].) the evidence showed more than an impulsive, passing remark. croaker threatened santana in the morning. approximately five hours later he returned, still angry at santana despite the passage of time. croaker twice attempted to punch santana, once in the morning and once in the afternoon, demonstrating he intended to carry out his threats. croaker knew what type of vehicle santana drove, and had contemplated attacking santana in that vehicle. croaker named several other places where santana worked, and threatened to attack him at each one. the specificity and knowledge showed a troubling gravity of purpose. other persons in the facility warned santana to be careful because croaker would carry out his threats. after witnessing the afternoon incident, murillo was thus, there was strong evidence santana was not simply overreacting, or unreasonably vior. 9 croaker nonetheless contends the jury could have found regarding their past interactions. croaker points out that santana was familiar with him, having seen him on a daily or weekly basis for several years; had experienced no prior problems with him; had not known him to be violent; and had not received complaints about him. indeed, santana testified he was shocked but, given the circumstances here, the absence of prior violent behavior does not provide sufficient to the contrary, the most reasonable inference from the evidence was that sudden, uncharacteristic change in behavior was cause for alarm. repeated threats, the content of his statements, his repeated attempts to punch santana, and the impressions of other persons who witnessed the incidents, a jury would have in light of the strong reasonable and the dearth of contrary evidence, the trial court did not err by omitting the attempted criminal threats instruction. in any event, even assuming arguendo the trial court erred, reversal is not required. the failure to instruct sua sponte on a lesser included offense in a noncapital case is, at most, an error of california law alone, and reversal is required only if an examination of the entire record establishes a reasonable probability the error affected the outcome. (people v. wyatt, supra, 55 cal.4th at p. 698; people v. brown (2016) 245 cal.app.4th 140, 155; people v. cady (2016) 7 cal.app.5th 134, 149.) in this context, a reasonable probability does not mean more likely than not, but merely a reasonable chance, more than 10 an abstract possibility. (people v. brown, at p. 155; people v. sandoval (2015) 62 cal.4th 394, 422.) for the reasons we have discussed, no such probability exists here. as we have explained, there was compelling evidence s fear was reasonable. there was minimal evidence to the contrary, comprised only of evidence croaker had not behaved in an alarming fashion previously. at trial croaker argued santana was not actually afraid, but did not contend santana was afraid but his fear was unreasonable, as he now contends. to find croaker guilty of attempted criminal threats on an unreasonable fear theory, the jury would have had to believe croaker made the threats, intended them to be taken as threats, santana understood them as such, and santana was actually in sustained fear, but that fear was nevertheless unreasonable. given the evidence, for the reasons we have discussed, there was no reasonable probability the jury would have made such a finding. 11 disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports edmon, p. j. we concur: lavin, j. egerton, j.
