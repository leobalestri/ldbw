(a)) and one count of assault with a deadly weapon or by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury ( 245, subd. (a)(1)). the people also alleged defendant had suffered four prior serious or violent felony convictions under the three-strikes law (strike allegations) ( 667, subds. (b)(i), 1170.12, subds. (a)(d)) and served four prior prison terms ( 667.5, subd. (b)). a jury convicted defendant of assault by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury and of inflicting corporal injury on his spouse. the jury also found true three of the strike allegations. the court sentenced defendant to a term of 25 years to life in prison for his conviction for infliction of corporal injury on his sentence as to his conviction for assault by means likely to produce great bodily injury. and sentence were later affirmed on appeal. 4 2. proposition 36 proceedings on april 29, 2013, defendant filed a petition for resentencing under proposition 36.2 the people filed an opposition to the petition on august 29, 2013, and defendant filed his reply on november 12, 2014. on march 9, 2015, the people filed a supplemental brief addressing the impact of proposition 47 on proposition 36 and a supplemental opposition . in their supplemental opposition, the people argued defendant was ineligible for resentencing because the facts of his underlying offense established that he intended to cause great bodily injury to his wife when he attacked her. on july 23, 2015, defensupplemental opposition. among other things, defendant argued the court was required to make its eligibility finding applying the in september 2015, the court conducted a two-day eligibility hearing on defendant on september 25, 2015, the court issued a written ruling denying petition. the court concluded victim] several times in the ear, [defendant] intended to inflict great bodily injury upon [the victim] and in fact accomplished preponderance of the evidence, defendant was ineligible for relief under proposition 36. defendant timely appealed. 2 defendant had first filed a petition for resentencing in january 2013, which the court denied without prejudice because defendant failed to serve the people. 5 discussion 1. to determine eligibility for resentencing under proposition 36, a trial court may make factual findings beyond the facts and circumstances necessarily decided in the underlying conviction. defendant contends the trial court exceeded the permissible scope of review of the record of conviction when it made its eligibility finding. according to defendant, because the jury did not, and was not required to, make a finding of intent to inflict great bodily injury to convict him of the assault and corporal injury charges, the court exceeded its authority by making a finding of fact that was not necessary to determine whether defendant committed those offenses. we disagree. under proposition 36, an inmate is ineligible to have his or her third-strike sentence reduced if the sentence was imposed for an offense listed in, among other statutory provisions, section 667, subdivision (e)(2)(c)(iii). ( 1170.26, subd. (e)(2).) thusor deadly weapon, or intended to cause great bodily injury to ineligible for resentencing under proposition 36. ( 1170.26, subd. (e)(2), 667, subd. (e)(2)(c)(iii).) circumstances of the underlying offense disqualify a defendant from resentencing under proposition 36 is similar to the determination of whether a prior conviction constitutes a serious or violent felony. (people v. hicks (2014) 231 cal.app.4th 275, 286.) both determinations must be based on the record of conviction. (see ibid.; people v. guerrero (1988) 44 cal.3d 343, 355 (guerrero).) the record of conviction includes the appellate opinion (people v. woodell (1998) 17 cal.4th 448, 456); transcripts of testimony from the underlying trial (people v. bartow (1996) 6 46 cal.app.4th 1573, 15801582); admissions (people v. goodner (1990) 226 cal.app.3d 609, 616); and preliminary hearing transcripts (people v. blackburn (1999) 72 cal.app.4th 1520, 1531). it also includes facts established within the record, such as a defendant's personal admissions on tahl3 waiver forms, even if those facts are not essential to the judgment. (people v. smith (1988) 206 cal.app.3d 340, 344345 (smith).) defendant relies on guerrero and people v. trujillo (2006) 40 cal.4th 165 (trujillo) to contend the court erred in finding he was ineligible for resentencing because whether he intended to cause great bodily injury to his wife was not an element of assault or infliction of corporal injury, and such a finding could argues the finding, which violates the holdings of guerrero and trujillo. defendant reads guerrero and trujillo too narrowly, especially as they apply to an eligibility finding under proposition 36. under guerrero and trujillo, a sentencing court may not make factual findings based on facts that were never (see trujillo, supra, 40 cal.4th at pp. 179181.) those cases do not, however, preclude a trial court from making factual findings that can be established by competent evidence that is included in the record of conviction. (see smith, supra, 206 cal.app.3d at pp. 343345.) indeed, the overwhelming majority of courts that have addressed the same issue raised by defendant have agreed that at the eligibility stage of a proposition 36 proceeding, a trial court may make a factual determination based on its review of the record of conviction, even if that finding is not confined to the 3 in re tahl (1969) 1 cal.3d 122. 7 facts and circumstances that establish the nature and basis of the underlying conviction. (see, e.g., people v. osuna (2014) 225 cal.app.4th 1020, 10331038; people v. bradford (2014) 227 cal.app.4th 1322, 13321334; people v. white (2014) 223 cal.app.4th 512, 525528; people v. arevalo (2016) 244 cal.app.4th 836, 847 (arevalo); people v. frierson (2016) 1 cal.app.5th 788, 791793, review granted october 19, 2016; people v. newman (2016) 2 cal.app.5th 718, 723727, review granted november 22, 2016; but see people v. berry (2015) 235 cal.app.4th 1417, 14251428 [in determining whether a defendant who pled guilty to the underlying offense is eligible for resentencing under proposition 36, the trial court cannot look to evidence relating to any dismissed charges if that evidence does not also pertain to the charges to which the defendant pled guilty].) we too agree that determination is not limited to the facts or circumstances necessarily decided in the underlying proceeding. defendant on people v. wilson (2013) 219 cal.app.4th 500 is misplaced. in wilson, the sixth district held rendered the a strike under the three-strikes law finding was not encompassed within the elements of the prior offense. (id. at p. impose a sentence above the statutory maximum based on disputed facts about prior conduct not admitted by the defendant or implied by the elements of the offense].) unlike this case, wilson involved the imposition of a second-strike sentence in the first instance; it did not involve a request to retroactively reduce a lawfully imposed third-strike sentence. (see id. at pp. 503504.) the determination of whether a defendant is eligible to have his or her 8 sixth amendment rights. (dillon v. united states (2010) 560 u.s. 817, 828829, [130 s.ct. 2683, 177 l.ed.2d 271]; see people v. superior court (kaulick) (2013) 215 cal.app.4th 1279, 1304.) here, the court properly limited its eligibility determination to only evidence that was included in the record of conviction. because the court was permitted to find from its review of that evidence that defendant intended to inflict great bodily when he committed his underlying assault and infliction of corporal injury offenses, we turn to proof when it made that finding. 2. of proof to its eligibility determination was harmless. defendant contends the trial court applied the incorrect standard of proof when it found he intended to cause great bodily injury during his infliction of corporal injury and assault offenses.4 specifically, he argues the court should have applied in light of our opinion in arevalo, supra, 244 cal.app.4th at pp. 847853, we agree with contention that the court applied the incorrect standard of proof to its eligibility determination. in light of the error was plainly harmless, whether viewed through the prism of federal constitutional law (chapman v. california (1967) 4 argument by not raising it below. defendant explicitly argued he was entitled to have the eligibility finding made using a beyond a reasonable doubt standard of proof. 9 386 u.s. 18, 24 [87 s.ct. 824, 17 l.ed.2d 705]) or state law (people v. watson (1956) 46 cal.2d 818, 836.) here, overwhelming evidence in the record supports a finding of intent to cause great bodily injury based on conduct and his injuries. for example, dtimes in the ear. defendant also used so much force that he not he also caused the cartilage of the ear to be exposed. one of the officers who the attack swolear. another officer who examithe incident ays and that her ear was swollen and lacerated. according to the doctor, defendant had hit his wife so hard that the skin on the artilage to be exposed. due to the severity of the injury, the doctor had recommended the wife consult a plastic surgeon. to be sure, there is also evidence in the record that defendant had used cocaine before the attack and asked one of the officers who responded to the scene of the attack to tell his wife he was sorry that he had hurt her. we disagree, however, that this evidence would cause the court to reach a different finding under a beyond a reasonable doubt standard of proof. in short, based on the severity of the injury defendant inflicted on his wife, the amount of force that defendant would have had to use to inflict such an injury, finding that the 10 severity of that injury showed that defendant intended to inflict great bodily injury, the error was harmless. disposition resentencing petition is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports lavin, j. we concur: edmon, p. j. goswami, j.* * judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
