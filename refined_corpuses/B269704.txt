(pen. code,  187.)1 the people also charged perez and ruiz with kidnapping ( 207, subd. (a)), and perez with torture ( 206). to support a sentence of life without the possibility of parole for the murder charge, the people alleged special circumstances: as to all three defendants, the people alleged that the murder was committed in the course of a kidnapping ( 190.2, subd. (a)(17)) and that defendants intentionally killed mejia while they were active participants in a criminal street gang ( 186.22, subd. (f) & 190.2, subd. (a)(22)); as to perez, the people also alleged that the murder was intentional and involved the infliction of torture 1 all further statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise indicated. 4 ( 190.2, subd. (a)(18)). the people alleged that all of the charged crimes were committed for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with a criminal street gang ( 186.22, subd. (b)(1)). the people further alleged that barajas had served two prior prison terms ( 667.5, subd. (b)). all three defendants were tried together. the jury convicted barajas of first degree murder, and found true the gang participation special circumstance. the jury convicted perez and ruiz of second degree murder, and found true the kidnapping special circumstance. the jury convicted perez and ruiz of kidnapping, and perez of torture. as to all crimes and all defendants, the jury found true the allegation that the crimes were committed for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with a criminal street gang. the trial court sentenced perez to prison for 48 years to life, comprised of 15 years to life for second degree murder, plus a consecutive life sentence with a 15-year minimum for the torture count (calculated as a life term with a 15-year minimum for the gang enhancement), plus a consecutive 18-year term for the kidnapping (calculated as an eight-year base term plus 10 years for the gang enhancement). the court sentenced ruiz to prison for 33 years to life, comprised of 15 years to life for second degree murder plus a consecutive 18-year term for the kidnapping. the court sentenced barajas to life without the possibility of parole plus two years, one for each of his two prior prison terms; the court stayed the gang enhancement. each defendant filed a timely notice of appeal. 5 discussion i. admission of jailhouse statements a. pertinent facts in its case-in-chief, the people introduced statements perez and barajas had separately made to jailhouse informants while each was in custody on unrelated charges. perez told the street in a trash can, and then body to long beach, doused it in gasoline, set it on fire, and then threw it in a river. barajas told the informants that he was hanging out at the vacant lot when perez and ruiz brought bludgeoning mejia with the cinder block-filled t-shirt, that he drove the body to a park in long beach, and that he doused the body in lighter fluid and set it afire. b. analysis defendants challenge the admission of these statements on two grounds: (1) perez and barajas assert that these statements were obtained in violation of miranda v. arizona (1966) 384 u.s. 436 (miranda), due process, and the sixth amendment right to counsel; and (2) perez and ruiz argue that the admission of s statementswhen he did not testify at trialviolated their constitutional rights to confront witnesses, to due process, and to present a defense. we independently review claims of constitutional error. (people v. enraca (2012) 53 cal.4th 735, 753; people v. mayo (2006) 140 cal.app.4th 535, 553.) 1. s challenges jailhouse informants did not violate their miranda rights. as a 6 -incrimination, miranda requires law enforcement to advise suspects of their rights to remain silent and to have counsel l people v. jackson (2016) 1 cal.5th 269, 338-339.) although suspects voluntarily speaking with jailhouse miranda does not apply to them because the dangers against which miranda guards-dominated atmosphere the defendant is unaware people v. davis (2005) 36 cal.4th 510, 554; illinois v. perkins (1990) 496 u.s. 292, 298-300 (perkins)miranda arguments are without merit. the admission of the statements . due process precludes the use of a hat statement is the product of coercion. (people v. mccurdy (2014) 59 cal.4th 1063, 1086.) perez and barajas argue that their statements were coerced because (1) they were pressured by the jailhouse informants to implicate themselves, and (2) the use of police deception itself was coercive. we reject both arguments. the first argument is o the recorded conversations, that perez and barajas were e were no threats, no . . . aggression, and nothing to indicate [defendants were] afraid of getting beat by th defendants cite a number of cases in support of their argument, but each involves a level of coercion absent here. (people v. esqueda (1993) 17 cal.app.4th 1450, 1486-1487 [interrogation 7 may be coercive]; people v. carrington (2009) 47 cal.4th 145, 176 ar psychological vulnerability people v. kelly (1990) 51 cal.3d may be coercive].) nor did the use of subterfuge by itself constitute coercion (people v. chutan (1999) 72 cal.app.4th 1276, ubterfuge is not necessarily coercive in natureparticularly where it is authorized by another more specific constitutional guarantee (perkins, supra, 496 u.s. at p. 298 miranda was not meant to protect suspects from boasting about their criminal activities in front of persons whom they believe to be their cellmates). the admission of the statements did not violate the sixth amendment. although the sixth amendment prohibits police from deliberately eliciting statements using jailhouse informants (people v. hartsch (2010) 49 cal.4th 472, 490-491), the sixth that is, it only applies to the subject judicial criminal proceedings have been initiated(people v. slayton (2001) 26 cal.4th 1076, 1079). here, neither perez nor barajas had been charged with the crimes in this case at the time they spoke with the jailhouse informants. 2. s statements that implicated witnesses. under the so-called aranda/bruton doctrine, a en a -of-court statement implicating the defendant is introduced in evidence unless the codefendant testifies (and is 8 subject to cross-examination) or unless the portions of the statement implicating the defendant are redacted in a non-obvious way. (people v. capistrano (2014) 59 cal.4th 830, 869 (capistrano); see generally people v. aranda (1965) 63 cal.2d 518; bruton v. united states (1968) 391 u.s. 123.) since crawford v. washington (2004) 541 u.s. 36, 68, right to confront witnesses has been interpreted to protect against the admission of out-of-court statements only if those statements are ng of (people v. arauz (2012) 210 cal.app.4th 1394, 1402; people v. hajek and vo (2014) 58 cal.4th 1144, 1214), ts were ,violated. statements violates their rights to due process and to present a defense is without merit, for we will not read these broader guarantees to prohibit what the more specific constitutional guarantee (here, the sixth amendment right to confront witnesses) perstatements constitute inadmissible hearsay is not only forfeited but is also s are declarations against his penal interest (evid. code,  1230). ii. instructional error a. pertinent background the trial court instructed the jury that it could convict the 9 defenda(that is, - the court further instructed the jury that felony-murder liability was appropriate one cand enumerated seven factors one of those factors kidnapping] but while one or more of the perpetrators continued to exercise control over the person who was the target of the the request to instruct continues only until the perpetrator has reached a place of b. analysis perez and ruiz argue that the trial court erred in refusing to give the escape rule instruction, arguing that the giving of such an instruction was all but compelled by people v. wilkins (2013) 56 cal.4th 333 (wilkins). we independently review claims of instructional error. (people v. fiore (2014) 227 cal.app.4th 1362, 1378.) at the outset, we note that this alleged instructional error pertains to the felony-murder instructions alone. the sole felony at issue herekidnappingis grounds for first degree murder under the felony-murder rule. ( 189.) because the jury found perez and ruiz guilty of second degree murder, its verdict necessarily rests on malice aforethought, not on the felony-murder rule. as a result, any error with the felony-murder instructions would appear to be harmless. (see people v. perez 10 (2005) 35 cal.4th there is no instructional error in any event. under the felony-murder rule, a defendant is guilty of murder if he kills another person while committing an inherently dangerous felony; his intent to commit the felony is legally deemed to be the equivalent of . (people v. bryant (2013) 56 cal.4th 959, 965; see generally  187 & 189.) the felony-ller[] people v. cavitt (2004) 33 cal.4th 187, 193, 196 (cavitt).) a nonkiller is guilty of murder under the felony-murder rule only if there is h a causal relationship and a temporal relationship between id. at p. 193.between the homicidal act and the underlying felony the ibid.) and a id. at pp. 193, 207.) in this case, the trial court instructed the jury that it must kidnapping and his death were part of a for murder under the felony-murder rule, and further explained that it could consider whether any of the defendants still had control over mejia. this was correct under cavitt. there, three people burglarized a house and tied up a woman inside the house. two of the burglars tied up the third (to make it look like the third was also a victim), and left the third beside the tied-up 11 woman, who was her stepmother. the stepmother died at some point thereafter. the people charged the two burglars who had left the scene trial court erred in instructing the jury that they could be liable under the felony-murder rule because it was possible that the third robber killed her stepmother on her own and after they had left the scene. cavitt rejected their argument, concluding that the trial court did not err in instructing the jury that the liability of the nonkillers (that is, the two burglars who left) under the felony-all perpetrators [had] relinquished control over the victim[,] . . . and have effected an cavitt, supra, 33 cal.4th at p. 208.) the trial court here gave the same instructions affirmed in cavitt. perez and ruiz argue that this case is instead controlled by wilkins. we disagree. in wilkins, the defendant was convicted of felony murder for a death that occurred after he committed a burglary, and one of the items he stole (a stove) fell out of his truck and killed someone. (wilkins, supra, 56 cal.4th at p. 337.) our supreme court held that the trial court erred in not instructing felony-(id. at pp. 342-343.) significantly, wilkins took pains to distinguish and uphold cavitt, explaining that cavitt complicity aspect of the felony-murder not, as in wilkinskiller [is] liable for first degree murder if the homicide is committed in the perpetration of ibid., quoting cavitt, supra, 33 cal.4th at p. 196, original italics.) because this case, like cavitt, involves 12 er the felony-murder rule for cavitt and not wilkins controls. this result makes sense as well. as wilkins escape rule establouter li- theory the underlying felony is over, any death that occurs thereafter is necessarily outside the scope of the felony-murder rule. (wilkins, supra, 56 cal.4th at p. 345.) however, where there are multiple defendants, the fact that some of the defendants may have reached a place of safety cannot be e of liability under the felony-murder rule. indeed, as the trial court noted in this case, mejia was still being kidnapped by barajas at the time of his death, even though perez and/or ruiz may have reached a place of temporary safety. instructing the jury thdeath ended, just because they had reached a place of safety, but while their fellow gang member still held mejia captive, would unduly curtail the scope and reach of felony-murder liability. iii. sufficiency of the evidence all three defendants argue that there is insufficient review the whole record in the light most favorable to the judgment to determine whether it contains substantial evidencei.e., evidence that is credible and of solid valuefrom which a rational trier of fact could have found the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.people v. nguyen (2015) 61 cal.4th 1015, 1054-1055.) 13 a. pdegree murder that it convicted them of second degree murder based upon a finding that they acted with malice aforethought (rather than on a felony-murder theory), and (2) there is insufficient evidence 2 of inconsistent verdicts is no basis to overturn them (e.g., people v. lewis (2001) 25 cal.4th 610, 655-656), we agree with perez and ruiz, for the reasons noted above, appear to be based upon the felony-murder rule. however, we disagree with perez and ruiz that there is insufficient evidence of causation. people v. sanchez (2001) 26 cal.4th 834, 847.) conduct is a substantial factor even if another person concurrently causes the death by engaging in also] . . . death. (people v. jennings (2010) 50 cal.4th 616, 643.) where the concurrent causes was the principal or primary cause of jennings, at p. 643, quoting people v. catlin (2001) 26 cal.4th 81, 155.) 2 ruiz also contends that there was insufficient evidence tying him to the crime. however, barajas in his statement to the jailhouse informants identifies ruiz as one of the people who beat mejia. what is more, the day after the beating, perez and ruiz cause they 14 subsequently causes the death, as long as the intervening cause is a normal and reasonably foreseeable resultthe defendant should have foreseen the possibility of some harm of the kind which might result from his act.people v. cervantes (2001) 26 cal.4th 860, 871.) it is only if the intervening act is extraordinary and abnormalunforeseeablethat courts will sever the causal chain and absolve the defendant of criminal liability for the death. (ibid.) in this case, finding of causation. to begin, there is evidence to support a finding that the beating inflicted by perez and ruiz and the bludgeoning inflicted by bajaras were concurrent causes of examithat mejia died from th injuries to his head caused by blunt force. perez and ruiz stomped on cinder block pieces. alternatively, there is evidence to support a foreseen. perez and ruiz took mejia to the empty lot where their fellow gang members hang out, and it is reasonable to foresee that a fellow gang member at the lot (such as barajas) would take efforts to ensure that evidence linking the gang to the carved in his chest) was destroyed. (cf. people v. fiu (2008) 165 cal.app.4th 360, 374, fn. 19 [superseding cause where random 15 b. for first degree murder barajas asserts that there is insufficient evidence to convict him of first degree murder (1) if his statements to the jailhouse informants are excluded, and (2) due to the conflicting evidence argument because, as we conclude above, his statements were as we also conclude above, there is substantial evidence that each of the three defendants concurrentl iv. sentencing a. multiple punishment perez and ruiz assert that the trial court erred in imposing consecutive sentences for murder and kidnapping under section banning multiple punishments. perez and ruiz are essentially arguing that they are being punished twice for a single indivisible course of conduct, because precludes a court from imposing cumulative sentences for the same conduct only when the legislature fails to specifically authorize such punishment. (people v. andrade (2015) 238 cal.app.4th 1274, 1309.) because section 654 authorizes multiple punishments under certain circumstances, whether the trial court violated section 654. section 654, subdivision (a) provides that a court may not punish a deonce, even if that act is the basis for multiple convictions. whether a course of conduct is a divisible transaction that can be 16 to one objective, the defendant may be punished for any one of such offencapistrano, supra, 59 cal.4th at p. 885.) but if a defendant commits various acts, even simultaneously or in direct succession to one another, with separately punished for each offense. (people v. rodriguez (2015) 235 cal.app.4th 1000, 1005 (rodriguez).) whether the defendant had more than one criminal objective is a factual finding made by the trial court, which we will uphold if it is supported by substantial evidence. (people v. chung (2015) 237 cal.app.4th 462, 469.) sfinding that the kidnapping and murder were committed with different intents and objectives. mejia was beaten in retaliation for his earlier shooting of gallegos, but killed to enable the beaters to avoid detection. these are separate intents. perez and ruiz -circumstance finding that the murder occurred during the commission of the kidnapping compels a finding that the kidnapping and murder were committed with the same intent and objective. we disagree. the fact that the homicide occurred during the kidnapping does not necessarily mean they were committed with the same intent and objective. (rodriguez, supra, 235 cal.app.4th at p. 1005 [simultaneous acts with different intents may be separately punished].) b. clerical errors perez and ruiz also raise clerical errors as to their respective sentences. the people agree there was error. 17 1. perez the trial court sentenced perez to life in prison for his torture conviction and specified that pursuant to section 186.22, subdivision (b)(5), he serve a minimum of 15 years before becoming eligible for parole. the minute order and abstract of judgment on this count inaccurately reflect a sentence of life plus a 15-year enhancement. corrected to reflect a term of life in prison, with parole eligibility only after he serves 15 years. 2. ruiz at sentencing, the trial court ordered ruiz to pay a $10,000 restitution fine ( 1202.4, subd. (b)), a $40 court security fee ( 1465.8, subd. (a)(1)), and a $30 criminal conviction assessment (gov. code,  70373), and t following sentencing, the clerk of the superior court prepared two abstracts of judgmentone for his murder conviction and one for his kidnapping conviction. each abstract imposed a $10,000 restitution fine plus a court security fee of $80 (double the per-conviction amount) and a criminal conviction assessment of $60 (double the per-conviction amount). ruiz argues that the abstracts improperly doubled the restitution fine and fees authorized by law (see  1202.4, subd. (b) [i]n every case . . . the court shall impose a separate and additional restitution fine, italics added];  1465.8, subd. (a)(1) conviction, italics added];  70373 [providing for $30 criminal conviction conviction, italics added]). he is right. the total amount of the restitution fine is $10,000 for both counts, the total amount of the court security fee is $80 for both 18 counts, and the total amount of the criminal conviction assessment is $60 for both counts. disposition eflect that he is sentenced to life in prison, with parole eligibility after amended to reflect that he is to pay a $10,000 restitution fine, $40 court security fees per count, and $30 criminal conviction assessment fees per countfor an overall total of a $10,000 fine plus an $80 court security fee plus a $60 conviction assessment fee. not to be published in the official reports. ______________________, j. hoffstadt we concur: _________________________, acting p. j. ashmann-gerst _________________________, j.* goodman * retired judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
