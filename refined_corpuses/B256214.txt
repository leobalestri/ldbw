of his ex-girlfriend and found true a personal gun use allegation. the jury found not true a gang allegation. nonetheless, defendant contends that admission of gang due process rights. he also contends that the judgment must be reversed, because the court gave a , and because of juror misconduct. we reject these contentions, but we do find that the matter must be reversed and remanded for reconsideration, under miller v. alabama (2012) 567 u.s. ___ [132 s.ct. 2455] (miller), 50-years-to-life sentence. factual and procedural background i. factual background. a. december 2, 2007: the murder of diana t. in 2007, diana t. was 14 years old.1 she lived with her mother in an area dominated by temple street gang. defendant, who was then 15, lived a block away. defendant was in temple street gang, and his moniker was lazy or trigger or triste (sad boy). diana and defendant dated for two-to-three months, but they broke up in may 2007. diana started dating osmon ruiz. in approximately november 2007, defendant told janine tapang and jasmin diana.2 when janine suggested diana was pretty, defendant again referring to diana. 1 because many witnesses were juveniles at the time of these events we sometimes use first names. 2 he said this twice, although it is unclear whether it was on one or two occasions. 3 on december 1, 2007, diana went to the santa monica pier with jasmin and osmon. jasmin and diana lived across the street from each other, in different apartment buildings. according to osmon, they returned to osmonand osmon and his uncle walked diana home.3 they saw defendant, who was with one or two people. defendant walked toward them, and, when he was about 20 feet away, diana kissed osmon on his cheek. she had never done that before. defendant walked by the next day, december 2, 2007, diana left her apartment at 1:00 p.m., after apartment. while jasmin showered, outside front steps. defendant came by and asked diana if she wanted to take a walk. from his window, osmon 1:00 p.m. diana left with defendant. jasmin saw diana walking away with defendant on coronado toward the 101 freeway. they turned left, onto london. thinking that diana diana never returned. asuncion torres lived nearby on north lafayette park place. at about 2:00 p.m., a neighbor told torres a body was in the alley. tor which was a walkway separated from the 101 freeway by a wall. diana was on the ground, face up. she had been shot in the right side of her forehead, but she was still breathing. there was stippling around the wound, indicating that she was shot at close range, typically within 18 inches to two feet. diana was taken to the hospital, but she was not identified until days later. she died on december 6, 2007. 3 jasmin, however, testified that when they returned from the pier, she and diana did not see defendant that night. 4 fon the wall was temple street graffiti in colors that included yellow and blue. lazy, and luckyyellow on the wall. to the responding officer, the yellow and blue paint appeared to be freshecially coming over the freeway. cars kick it up. brake dust. and it adheres to the wall where the blocks come to the concrete block walls. you have the same you can run your finger across, and it comes away with dust. he newer taggings, the yellow and the blue. plus faded. as you can see on other taggings4 blue and yellow spray cans were recovered from within 10 feet of diana the spray cans appeared to be new, because they were not rusted. a fingerprint on a can did not belong to defendant. that evening of december 2, 2007, alexandra saw defendant at about 5:00 p.m. in clothes different than the ones he had been wearing earlier in the day. she asked where diana was, and he said he gave her money to go on the bus and she was never coming back. jasmin also asked defendant where was diana. he said he gave diana a dollar to smirking, defendant said shcoming back. jasmin accused defendant of taking diana and not bringing her back. defendant laughed. jasmin noticed that defendant had a teardrop tattoo and three dots. 4 if it was wet, but he could not recall whether he did that or whether the paint was wet. 5 the next day, jasmin again accused defendant of killing diana. he laughed and money, s when the investigating detective spoke to everything was really recent, and i lived in that neighborhood. i 5 alexandra testified that defendant had a teardrop tattoo the day after diana went missing. saw defendant. his face was swollen and he had two teardrops. janine testified that about a month after diana died, she saw defendant, who now had tattoos on his face. b. ang evidence. police officer hugo ayon testified about gangs. he first testified about how people join gangs. usually, younger kids, between the ages of 12 and 15 or 16 start to hang around older gang members, idolizing them. the gang courts kids and then jumps them into the gang. putting in work the younger kids, this could mean putting up graffiti or fighting with rival gang members. then it gang the more powerful a gang is carr one of the most important things for a gang is to earn respect and to cause fear among enemies. this allows them to commit crimes without 5 until 2011. 6 fear of people contacting the police. snitchingcooperating with the police or providing information to the police territory, the bigg gang members also use monikers to conceal their true identity. and that are passed from member to member on an as needed basis. temple street gang has been around since 1923. in december 2007, it had between 150-to 200-active members. officer ayon personally spoke to over 100 members of the gang. he investigated vandalisms, burglaries, robberies, shootings, and murders committed by gang members. the gang does not have a specific color, but it favors blue and black. the most common tattoos are tst, 1923, vtr, and t. they also have a gang sign. symbols they when more than one moniker is present in graffiti, generally each person to whom the moniker refers was present when the graffiti was painted. there are a variety of reasons someone gets a teardrop tattoo: when somebody is killed, for dead family members, or because officer ayon first met defendant in early 2007, when defendant was not yet a member of temple street and did not have any tattoos. his moniker was lazy, although at one point he used baby trigger. based on a hypothetical modeled on the facts of this case, officer ayon testified that such a crime benefits the gang. members of temple street there with him. he was disrespected, and he was obligated to answer to that disrespect. by shooting the ex-girlfriend and killing her, he answered. he answered that disrespe 7 intimidation within that community[,] which benefits the gang, makes them seem larger or maybe more powerful than they actually are. it dissuades potential witnesses and even c. the defense case. disagreed that killing a child or a young girl is something th [t]agreed (baby shadow), testified that he too was in the temple street gang. he was in juvenile camp when diana was shot. he, not his brother, wrote the graffiti on the walkway in the beginning of 2007. christian often saw jasmin with defendant; they seemed to be friends and jasmin was attracted to defendant. jasmin also hung out with temple street gang members, and, although she was not a member of the gang, she was an affiliate. aide villegas, who lived next door to jasmin, agreed that defendant and jasmin appeared to be friends. atives were temple street gang members, and she hung out with temple street gang members.6 villegas never saw defendant mistreat diana. abuse diana. but nataly noticed that defendant got a teardrop tattoo the day after diana disappeared. defendant testified. he admitted he was a temple street gang member and that he saw diana the afternoon she died; but he denied seeing her the night before she died, as osmon had testified. the afternoon she died, diana was in front of her house. defendant called her over and asked her to return some movies. they spoke for less than 6 jasmin denied socializing with temple street gang members, although she knew gang members. 8 five minutes. defendant did not kill diana. he also denied writing the graffiti in the walkway. his teardrop tattoo was to commemorate a dead homey and to symbolize his moniker, sad boy. defendant also said that he and jasmin were friends, and she socialized with temple street gang members. neither jasmin nor alexandra asked him where was diana. and 7 ii. procedural background. in 2012, an information was filed alleging that defendant killed diana. (pen. code,  187, subd. (a).)8 the information also alleged personal gun use ( 12022.53, subd. (d)) and gang ( 186.22, subd. (b)(1)(c)) enhancements. on july 12, 2013, a jury found defendant guilty of first degree murder and found the personal gun use allegation true. the jury found the gang allegation not true. on april 9, 2014, the trial court sentenced defendant to murder, plus a consecutive 25 years to life for the gun use. his total sentence therefore was 50 years to life in prison. discussion i. the admissibility of gang evidence. defendant contends that the trial court abused its discretion by denying his motion to bifurcate the gang allegation and that admitting gang evidence violated his federal due process rights. we disagree. 7 she smoked crack and hung out with popeye, who also smoked crack, was introduced to impeach defendant. 8 all undesignated statutory references are to the penal code. 9 a. additional facts: the bifurcation motion. before trial, the defense moved to bifurcate the gang allegation. as an offer of proof, the prosecutor represented that dianatime the murder occurred. next to her body were tags that lazy. the night before the murder, defendant saw diana defendant had seen this in front of his fellow gang members, and he let them know that 9 defendant told the victim he wdefendant was trying to make his name in the gang, and therefore could not tolerate being disrespected. the day after the murder, defendant got a teardrop tattoo, indicating someone had been killed. he told jasmin and alexandra that theyd better not come forward. the trial court denied the motion to bifurcate, finding that the evidence was inextricably intertwined with the facts of the case and was relevant to motive, intent, and identity. b. by admitting gang evidence, the trial court did not abuse its discretion or deny defendant a fundamentally fair trial. a trial court has discretion to order bifurcation of a gang allegation from trial of the substantive offense. (people v. hernandez (2004) 33 cal.4th 1040, 1049-1050 (hernandez).) bifurcation may be proper where gang evidence is prejudicial, and of so little relevance to guilt, that it threatens to sway the jury to convict id. at p. 1049membership is often relevant to, and admissible regarding, the charged offexample, to identity, motive, and specific intent. (ibid.evidence supporting the gang enhancement would be admissible at a trial of guilt, any 9 whether the friends were gang members. 10 inference of prejudice would be dispelled, and bifurcation would not be n(id. at pp. 1049-1050.) but even if some of the evidence offered to prove the gang enhancement would be inadmissible at a trial of the substantive crime itselfunder evidence code section 352, for examplea court may still deny bifurcation. (hernandez, at p. 1050.) because public policy favors the efficiency of a unitary trial, a s discretion to deny bifurcation of a gang allegation is broader than its discretion to admit gang evidence in a case with no gang allegation. (ibid.) we cannot find that the trial court abused its discretion by denying the bifurcation motion. (people v. samaniego (2009) 172 cal.app.4th 1148, 1167-1168.) for criminal behavior, its probative value generally exceeds its prejudicial effect, and (id. at p. 1168.) the gang evidence here was relevant to motive. the night before diana was shot, she kissed osmon in front of defetestimony that dand that maintaining respect is paramount in gang culture, explains why defendant would kill diana. although gang evidence explains why a 15-year-old boy who has been broken up with a girl for months would kill her for simply kissing another boy. he may have been jealous, but in the gang culture he was also disrespected. the gang evidence was also relevant to identity. (see generally people v. williams (1997) 16 cal.4th 153, 193 [gang evidence is relevant and may be admissible to prove, for example, identity, motive, and specific intent in connection with the charged offense].) freshly written name in the walkway tended to show he was there in or around the time diana was killed or, at a minimum, was familiar with the walkway. moreover, it was probative to identifying lazy. defendant, however, argues that even if 11 this is an overly simplistic view of the evidence. the graffiti identifies defendant by his gang name. the connection between and had to be explained. only gang evidence could explain it. similarly, he got either the day of or day after diana was shot. because one reason a gang member gang evidence was therefore inextricably intertwined with facts underlying the substantive offense, and it would have been admissible even had a gang enhancement not been alleged. defendant, however, argues that testimony had no probative value on any contested issue relating to he vice versa. but this evidence was relevant and admissible to prove the gang enhancement. (hernandez, supra, 33 cal.4th at p. 1044 [prosecution charges the criminal street gang enhancement, it will often present evidence that would be inadmissible in a trial limited to the charged offense.].) because gang evidence was admissible to establish motive and identity as to the charged offense, the prosecution was not limited to introducing only gang evidence relevant to the underlying crime; it could introduce evidence relevant to the enhancement. no minimally probative on the charged offense, and so inflammatory in comparison, that it threatened to sway the jury to convict regardless of defendant[]s actual guilt. (hernandez, supra, 33 cal.4th at p. 1051.) on this point, defendant focuses on evidence about herson gayton. to prong of the gang gang-related murder committed on december 27, 2008. the prosecutor later elicited from defendant on cross-examination that defendant and gayton were cousins and that gayton 12 lived next to jasmin.10 ruled it could not be used to establish a pattern of criminal gang activity and struck the we presume the jury followed that instruction. (people v. sims (1976) 64 cal.app.3d 544, 554-555.) we also note that the trial court gave a limiting instruction concerning the gang evidence. (calcrim no. 1403.)11 we presume the jury followed this instruction as well. (people v. hovarter (2008) 44 cal.4th 983, 1005.) in any event, tousin committed a gang-related murder a year after diana was not likely to sway the jury to convict defendant regardless of actual guilt. the murder gayton committed a year laterhis relationship to . dbrother, christian, testified for the defense. christian was a temple street gang member th, was in juvenile camp. defendant also did not dispute his own membership in the gang. therefore, to the extent defendant argues that having the jury discover that other members of his family were gang members was unduly inflammatory, other evidence introduced by defendant put that fact squarely in front of the jury. for thess refusal to bifurcate the gang allegation did not violate defendant due process rights and right to a fundamentally fair trial. an 10 the record is unclear, but a reasonable inference from the evidence is defendant 11 deciding whether: [] the defendant acted with the intent, purpose, and knowledge that are required to prove the gang-related enhancement charged; or [] the defendant had a motive to commit the crime charged. [] you may also consider this evidence when you evaluate the credibility or believability of a witness and when you consider the facts and information relied on by an expert witness in reaching his or her opinion. [] you may not consider this evidence for any other purpose. you may not conclude from this evidence that the defendant is a person of bad character or that he has a disposition to 13 evidentiary rulingwhether or not correct under state lawdenies a defendant due process of law only if it makes the trial fundamentally unfair. (estelle v. mcguire (1991) 502 u.s. 62, 70; people v. partida (2005) 37 cal.4th 428, 439; people v. albarran (2007) 149 cal.app.4th 214 (albarran).) [a defendant] must satisfy a high constitutional standard to show that the erroneous admission of evidence resulted in an unfair trial. inferences the jury may draw from the evidence can its admission violate due process. [citations.] only under such circumstances can it be inferred that the jury must have . . [citation.] (albarran, at pp. 229-230.) in albarran, the defendant was involved in a shooting. nothing inherent in the facts of the shooting suggested a specific gang motive, and the only evidence to support the gang-related motive was the fact of the defendants gang membership. (albarran, supra, 149 cal.app.4th at p. 227.) and the role it played in the prosecutors argument, albarran unusual occasions where the admission of evidence violated federal due process and s trial fundamentally unfair. (id. at p. 232.) we have detailed the ways in which gang evidence was relevant to motive and identity. nor do we find a reasonable likelihood that the jurys passions were inflamed by the gang evidence. (people v. williams (2009) 170 cal.app.4th 587, 612 [the danger in admitting gang evidence is the jury will improperly infer that the defendant has a criminal disposition].) the jury here found the gang allegation not true. thus, the jury did not accept the gang evidence uncritically.12 , for 12 we also note that the jury initially hung. 14 example, the last person seen with diana. alexandra, jasmin, and osmon saw diana walk away with him. defendant admitted that, on the afternoon diana died, he saw her out movies he wanted returned. soon after defendant was last seen with diana, she was shot. ii. the supplemental jury instruction. defendant next contends that the trial court, after the jury said it was hung, gave a supplemental instruction that coerced the verdict. we disagree. the jury began deliberations on wednesday, july 10, 2013, at 1:56 p.m., and court recessed at 4:05 p.m. the jury deliberated on thursday, july 11, but left early, at 12:05 p.m. on friday, july 12, the jury sent out a note at 10:25 a.m. stating it was hung and asking 13 the court proposed this response: given the length of time that this trial has taken and the number of witnesses and exhibits that have been received, the court is not of the belief that you are hopelessly deadlocked. i encourage each of you to further discuss this case and try to identify which issues of facts you are in disagreement about. as to those disagreements, consider whether the court can assist you by having certain testimony re-read, instructions further explained or argument reopened. please continue deliberating and let us know if and (italics added.) there and come to an agreement. i think we should inquire why they believe they are objection and gave the proposed supplemental instruction. the jury recessed for lunch from noon to 1:30 p.m. the jury gave its verdict at 2:15 p.m. 13 the honorable james r. brandlin was standing in for judge bachner. 15 defendant argues that the trial t hopelessly deadlocked coerced a verdict. a coercive instruction, known as an allen charge14 , is one that numerical division or preponderance of opinion of the jury in forming or reexamining their views on th (people v. gainer (1977) 19 cal.3d 835, 852, disapproved in part by people v. valdez (2012) 55 cal.4th 82, 163; see also jenkins v. united states (1965) 380 u.s. 445, 446 [instructing a deadlocked jury it has to reach a decision is coercive]; people v. whaley (2007) 152 cal.app.4th 968, 980.) a court, however, may ask jurors to continue deliberating where, in the exercise of its discretion, it finds a reasonable probability of agreement. (people v. pride (1992) 3 cal.4th 195, 265; people v. breaux (1991) 1 cal.4th 281, 319;  1140.)15 a claim that the trial court pressured a jury into reaching a verdict depends on the particular circumstances of the case. (pride, at p. 265.) when reviewing a coercion claim, we exs remarks in sending the jury back for further deliberations indicate[ ] an opinion on his part as to the guilt or innocence of the defendant, and whether the court creates the impression that in his mind the jury ought to (people v. diaz (1962) 208 cal.app.2d 41, 50.) here deadlocked did not give the impression the jury should convict defendant. in people v. pride, for example, the trial court similarly mistrial at this time. it does not appear to me that the jury has come to a hopeless deadlock, counsel. based upon the [juro 14 allen v. united states (1896) 164 u.s. 492 (allen). 15 section 1140 precludes a court from discharging the jury without a verdict unless both parties consent or, after the expiration of a period of time that the court deems proper, it appears to the satisfaction of the court there is no reasonable probability the jury can agree. 16 continue their deliberations, and i would appreciate it if you would continue trying.(people v. pride, supra, 3 cal.4th at p. 264.) this was not coercive. (id. at p. 266.) also, unlike the instructions in allen, which our california supreme court in gainer disapproved, the trial instructions did not encourage minority jurors to reexamine their s. (see generally people v. gainer, supra, 19 cal.3d at pp. 847-851 [admonition to minority jurors to rethink their position in light constituted excessive pressure on them to acquiesce in a verdict].) the court here did not refer to either the minority or the majority; instead, the court encouraged each of youwe discern nothing coercive defendant also makes too much of how long the jury deliberated in comparison to e correctthat the evidentiary portion of the trial for which the jury was present took approximately 12 hours over the course of six days and that the jury had deliberated just a bit more than five hours before sending their notewe reject that this discrunder section 1140, was well within its discretion to determinebased on, for example, the length of the trial, the number of witnesses, and the grave charges against defendantthat there was a reasonable probability the jury could yet reach a verdict. (people v. moore (2002) 96 cal.app.4th 1105, 1121-1122.) indeed, the jury indicated a verdict. 17 iii. juror misconduct. defendant moved for a new trial based on alleged juror misconduct. we find that the trial court properly denied the motion. a. the motion for a new trial based on juror misconduct. defendant moved for a new trial under section 1181, subdivision (4),16 on the motion was supported by the declaration of felipe de la torre, a deputy alternate public defender after the verdict was given, de la torre spoke to a male juror for two hours, and the juror said he was the lone hold-out that caused the jury to send the note to the judge that they were the juror directly at him, that would be a sign from god that [defendant] was innocent, and the was inadmissible under evidence code section 1150; the evidence purported to show the support a claim that the verdict was decided by means other than a fair expression of 16 section 1181, subdivision (4), provides that a new trial may be granted when the verdict has been decided by lot or by means other than a fair expression of opinion on the part of all the jurors. 18 b. the affidavit was inadmissible under evidence code section 1150. defendant argues that a further evidentiary hearing in the trial court. we disagree. discretion. (people v. lightsey (2012) 54 cal.4th 668, 729.) where a motion for new in re stankewitz (1985) 40 cal.3d 391, 397; see also people v. perez (1992) 4 cal.app.4th 893, 906; people v. hedgecock (1990) 51 cal.3d 395, 415 based on allegations of juror misconduct, the trial court has discretion to conduct an evidentiary hearing to determine the truth of .) on this threshold question, evidence code section 1150, subdivision (a) provides: admissible evidence may be received as to statements made, or conduct, conditions, or events occurring, either within or without the jury room, of such a character as is likely to effect of such statement, conduct, condition, or event upon a juror either in influencing him to assent to or dissent from the verdict or concerning the mental processes by which (ibid.; see also in re stankewitz at p. 397.) that is, such statements, conduct, he other senses and thus subject individual juror (in re stankewitz, supra, 40 cal.3d at p. 398.) where stitute misconduct, statements are among the overt acts admissible to show a verdict was improperly influenced. (ibid. [jurors incorrect legal advice to fellow jurors during deliberations was admissible to show misconduct]; people v. perez, supra, 4 cal.app.4th at p. 908 [s agreement to violats instruction estify does not touch on jurors subjective reasoning processes].) 19 de la torre was defendant suggests that the declaration nonetheless provided sufficient ground to hold an evidentiary hearing. we disagree. the declaration also violated evidence code section 1150 because t he hoped god would give him a sign was [w]hen a juror in the course of deliberations gives the reasons for his or her vote, the words are simply a verbal reflection of the jurors mental processes. consideration of such a statement as evidence of those processes is barred by evidence code section 11 (people v. hedgecock, supra, 51 cal.3d at p. 419.) that the juror put his thoughts into words by verbalizing them to de la torre and in prayer does not convert his subjective thought process into an overt act or event. of the admissibility of the evidence under ev this right. (people v. cornwell (2005) 37 cal.4th 50, 82, disapproved on another ground by people v. doolin (2009) 45 cal.4th 390, 421, fn. 22.) evidence code section 1150 to de la process rights. iv. cumulative error. defendant contends that the cumulative effect of the purported errors deprived him of a fair trial. s claims of error ame conclusion with respect to the cumulative effect of any purported errors. (people v. cole (2004) 33 cal.4th 1158, 1235-1236; people v. butler (2009) 46 cal.4th 847, 885.) 20 v. cruel and unusual punishment. defendant was 15 when he killed diana in 2007. by the time he was tried and sentenced to 50 years to life in prison in 2014, he was 20. (see generally  190, subd. (a), 12022.53, subd. (d).) the attorney general agrees that defendant will not be eligible for parole until defendant is 69 years old. defendant contends his sentence is cruel and unusual under the eighth amendment. in recent years, the united states supreme court and our california supreme court have limited the punishment available for juvenile offenders: the death penalty may not be imposed on juvenile offenders (roper v. simmons (2005) 543 u.s. 551 (roper)); life without possibility of parole (lwop) may not be imposed on juveniles who commit nonhomicide offenses (graham v. florida (2010) 560 u.s. 48); mandatory lwop may not be imposed on juvenile offenders (miller, supra, 132 s.ct. 2455); and a de facto lwop sentence may not be imposed on a juvenile nonhomicide offender (people v. caballero (2012) 55 cal.4th 262 (caballero)). the people argue that defendant falls outside roper and its progeny, because he committed a homicide and his 50-years-to-life sentence was not technically lwop.17 miller, however, forbids a mandatory lwop sentence for any juvenile offender, not just nonhomicide offenders, in the absence of the sentencing cours consideration of certain factors: chronological age and its hallmark featuresamong them, immaturity, impetuosity, and failure to appreciate risks and consequences. it prevents taking into account the family and home environment that surrounds himand from which he cannot usually extricate himselfno matter how brutal or dysfunctional. it neglects the circumstances of the homicide offense, including the extent of his participation in the conduct and the way 17 the california supreme court has granted review to determine whether a sentence of 50 years to life for a defendant convicted of a murder committed as a juvenile is the functional equivalent of lwop. (in re alatriste (2013) 220 cal.app.4th 1232, review granted feb. 19, 2014, s214652, and in re bonilla, review granted feb. 19, 2014, s214960.) 21 familial and peer pressures may have affected him. indeed, it ignores that he might have been charged and convicted of a lesser offense if not for [the] incompetencies associated with youthfor example, his inability to deal with police officers or prosecutors (including on a plea agreement) or his incapacity to assist his own attorneys. [citations.] and finally, this mandatory punishment disregards the possibility of rehabilitation even when the circumstances most sugges (miller, supra, 132 s.ct. at pp. 2468-2469.) caballero extended millers reasoning and found that a juvenile nonhomicide s 110-years-to-life sentence, although not technically lwop, was its functional equivalent, and therefore unconstitutional. to guarantee eventual freedom to a juvenile convicted of a nonhomicide offense, graham holds that the eighth amendment requires the state to afford the juvenile offender a n release based on demonstrated maturity and (caballero, supra, 55 cal.4th at p. 266.) miller and caballero thus may be read to prohibit imposition of a mandatory lwop sentence or its functional equivalent on any juvenile homicide or nonhomicide offender, without first considering the factors miller found relevant to punishment. s 50-years-to-life sentence is certainly less than the 110 years to life the juvenile was sentenced to in caballero. still, that defendant might be eligible for parole some years before his life expectancy does not give him a meaningful opportunity to obtain release based on demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation (graham v. florida, supra, 560 u.s. at pp. 73-75), and his 50-years-to-miller, supra, 132 s.ct. at p. 2468). under miller and caballero, defendants sentence may therefore be the functional equivalent of lwop. the people respond that section 3051 corrects any eighth amendment problem. with certain exceptions inapplicable here, the law, guarantees juvenile offenders the right ( 3051, subd. (a)(1).) juveniles, like defendant, 22 sentenced to an indeterminate base term of 25 years to life are entitled to a parole hearing during the 25th year of their incarceration. ( 3051, subd. (b)(3).) courts of appeal disagree whether section 3051 addresses millers concerns.18 some guidance may be found in people v. gutierrez (2014) 58 cal.4th 1354, 1379 (gutierrez). in gutierrez, lwop sentences were imposed on juvenile defendants under section 190.5, subdivision (b), which had been construed to create a presumption in favor of lwop sentences for special circumstance murders committed by 16- and 17-year-old offenders. (gutierrez, at p. 1379.) interpreting section 190.5, subdivision (b), to harmonize with the eighth amendment, gutierrez found that trial courts have discretion to sentence juvenile offenders to serve 25 years to life or lwop with no presumption in favor of lwop. (gutierrez, at pp. 1371-1379.) in so holding, gutierrez considered the recent enactment of section 1170, subdivision (d)(2), on lwop sentences for juvenile offenders. section 1170 allows youthful offenders to petition the court to recall their lwop sentences after serving 15 years, and, if then unsuccessful, at subsequent designated times. ( 1170, subd. (d)(2).) gutierrez rejected the notion that section 1170, subdivision (d)(2), millers concerns because the statute provides a meaningful opportunity for such offenders to (gutierrez, supra, 58 cal.4th at p. 1386.) 18 the issues raised in these cases and this appeal are currently on review. (people v. solis (2014) 224 cal.app.4th 727, review granted june 11, 2014, s218757 [modifying s 50-years-to-life sentence to include a minimum parole eligibility date of 25 years]; in re heard (2014) 223 cal.app.4th 115, review granted apr. 30, 2014, s216772 [section 3051 does not alleviate the constitutional concerns about a juvenile offenders sentence]; people v. garrett (2014) 227 cal.app.4th 675, review granted sept. 24, 2014, s220271 [same]; people v. hernandez (2014) 232 cal.app.4th 278, review granted apr. 1, 2015, s224383 [same]; in re wilson (2015) 233 cal.app.4th 544, review granted apr. 15, 2015, s224745 [same]; but see people v. gonzalez (2014) 225 cal.app.4th 1296, 1307, review granted july 23, 2014, s219167 [section 3051 cures the eighth amendment problem]; accord, people v. saetern (2014) 227 cal.app.4th 1456, review granted oct. 1, 2014, s220790.) 23 although section 3051 gives juvenile offenders a mechanism to obtain release without serving their entire sentence, it suffers from the same problem gutierrez saw in section 1170, subdivision (d)(2): outset, not 15 or 25 years in the future. thus, a sentencing court must, at the time of sentencing, exercise its discretion in accordance with miller. (see gutierrez, supra, 58 cal.4th at p. 1379.) (see miller, supra, 132 s.ct. at p. 2467.) here, ahis counsel asked the trial court to court recognizes that there are in the united states supreme court law regarding factors that would be considered by a court in imposing an lwop sentence. i think that is what [defense counsel] is referring to. there is a whole series of cases. there are new statutes in the state of california relating to that. nothing has been presented to the court in existence that a 50-year to life sentence would be the functional equivalent of an lwop sentence. [] accordingly, there is no legal basis for me to diverge from the law. if there is such a case . . . it was a general proposition . . . . the court is required to follow the statutory requirements. if there was such a case the trial court therefore declined to consider the miller factors, namely, defendantamong them, immaturity, impetuosity, and circumstances of the homicids participation in it, and familial and peer pressures. (miller, supra, 132 s.ct. at pp. 2468-2469.) we remand this matter with the direction to the trial s sentence in light of miller and caballero. we do not dictate what the outcome should be on remand. 24 disposition the judgment is reversed and remanded only for reconsideration of defendants sentence under the eighth amendment to the united states constitution; the judgment of conviction is otherwise affirmed. not to be published in the official reports aldrich, j. we concur: edmon, p. j. jones, j. judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
