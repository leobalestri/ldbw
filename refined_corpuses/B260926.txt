(see smith v. robbins (2000) 528 u.s. 259, 277-284.) we have examined the entire record and are satisfied appointed appellate counsel has fully complied with his responsibilities. on february 26, 2015, we advised defendant that he had 30 days within which to personally submit any arguments he wished us to consider. on march 12, 2015, defendant filed a letter brief with this court. evidence attached to his sentence recall petition indicates he has been a model prisoner. defendant discussed: his low risk of reoffending given his age, 73; his journey from criminal to ordained minister; and the steps he has taken towards rehabilitation. he admitted he had previously been convicted of murder. he did not, however, present any legal argument justifying relief under section 1170.126. defendant falsely claims he served two vietnam combat tours. his defense department form dd214 discharge document does not reflect such service. we have independently reviewed the record. the trial court properly denied the petition for recall of sentence because defendant has a prior second degree murder conviction. as a result of his prior conviction, defendant is statutorily ineligible for resentencing.
