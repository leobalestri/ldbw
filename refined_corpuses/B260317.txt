(a)(1)); a $30 criminal conviction fee (gov. code,  70373); a $150 drug program fee (health & saf. code,  11372.7, subd. (a)); a $20 dna assessment (gov. code,  76104.7); a $50 laboratory analysis fee assessments(health & saf. code,  11372.5, subd. (a)); a $300 restitution fine (pen. code,  1202.4, subd. (b)); a suspended $300 probation revocation restitution fine (pen. code,  1202.44); $2,386 in attorney fees, subject to appellant meeting with a financial evaluator (pen. code,  987.8); and the actual cost of probation services (pen. code,  1203.1b). appellant timely appealed. statement of facts los angeles police officer edgar ramos was working undercover on june 3, 2014, at approximately 8:00 p.m. in the area of 47th street and vermont avenue in los 3 angeles. he spotted a woman by the name of ms. allen with two companions and asked woman in ms. , and the group crossed the street. officer ramos approached ms. allen again five minutes later, and she indicated no one was present yet. soon after, ms. allen yelled to an unidentified black female walking down 47th street and told officer ramos she might have it. officer ramos approached the female, but she refused to speak to him. the female used ms. officer ramos then spotted appellant walking in their direction, and ms. allen pointed to ms. allen asked officer ramos for money, and he gave her a prerecorded $20 bill. ms. allen walked toward appellant, and after they exchanged some words, ms. allen handed appellant the $20 bill in exchange for something. ms. allen returned to officer ramos and handed him two off-white solids wrapped in a clear plastic bindle. in return, he handed her a prerecorded $10 bill as payment. officer ramos walked away and signaled to other officers the transaction had taken place. officers then arrested and searched appellant and ms. allen, recovering, among other items, the prerecorded $10 bill and a glass pipe from ms. allen and the prerecorded $20 bill from appellant. analysis of one of the off-white solids in the plastic bindle revealed it was comprised of 0.31 grams of cocaine in the form of cocaine base. discussion we appointed counsel to represent appellant on this appeal. after review of the -appointed counsel filed an opening brief asking this court to review the record independently pursuant to wende, supra, 25 cal.3d at page 441. on july 7, 2015, we advised appellant she had 30 days to submit any contentions or issues she wished us to consider. appellant did not file a supplemental brief. we have examined the entire record. we are satisfied no arguable issues exist that would compel reversal of her conviction. (smith v. robbins (2000) 528 u.s. 259, 279-284; wende, supra, 25 cal.3d at p. 441; see also people v. kelly (2006) 40 cal.4th 106, 123-124.) 4 however, we requested supplemental briefing on the following two issues related to the fines and fees imposed by the trial court: (1) was it error for the trial court not to impose the penalty assessments on the $150 drug program fee pursuant to health and safety code section 11372.7, subdivision (a)? (2) should the sentencing minute order be amended to specifically list the amounts and statutory authority for the penalty assessments attached to the $50 crime laboratory drug analysis fee pursuant to health and safety code section 11372.5, subdivision (a) and the $150 drug program fee pursuant to health and safety code section 11372.7, subdivision (a)? the parties filed simultaneous supplemental briefs and respondent filed a supplemental reply brief. after reviewing the 1. penalty assessments in addition to drug program fee (health & saf. code,  11372.7, subd. (a)) the parties agree the trial court erred in not assessing the following seven additional mandatory penalty assessments totaling $465 when it imposed the $150 drug program fee pursuant to health and safety code section 11372.7, subdivision (a): a $150 state penalty (pen. code,  1464, subd. (a)(1)); a $105 county penalty (gov. code,  76000, subd. (a)(1)); a $30 state surcharge (pen. code,  1465.7, subd. (a)); a $75 state court construction penalty (gov. code,  70372, subd. (a)(1)); a $30 emergency medical services penalty (gov. code,  76000.5, subd. (a)(1)); a $15 dna penalty (gov. code,  76104.6, subd. (a)(1)); and a $60 state-only dna penalty (gov. code,  76104.7, subd. (a)). (see people v. sharret (2011) 191 cal.app.4th 859, 864 (sharret).) normally a court of appeal may correct a judgment on appeal to impose these mandatory penalty assessments. (people v. castellanos (2009) 175 cal.app.4th 1524, 1530 (castellanos) are mandatory, their omission may be cohowever, health and safety code section 11372.7 contains an ability to pay provision. (health & saf. code,  who is convicted of a violation of this chapter has the ability to pay a drug program fee. if the court determines that the person has the ability to pay, the court may set the amount 5 to be paid and order the person to pay that sum to the county in a manner that the court believes is determination of whether a person has the ability to pay, the court shall take into account the amount of any fine imposed upon that person and any amount that person has been ordered to pay in restitution. if the court determines that the person does not have the ability to pay a drug program fee, the person shall not be required to pay a drug program people v. corrales (2013) 213 cal.app.4th 696, 702 (corrales); sharret, supra, 191 cal.app.4th at p. 864.) the record does not reflect the court expressly when it imposed the $150 assessment. (see corrales, supra, at p. determinecastellanos, supra, at p. 1531 [ . . . .) nonetheless, the additional mandatory penalty assessments increase the fee by (see corrales, supra, 213 cal.app.4th at p. 702; castellanos, supra, 175 cal.app.4th at p. 1532; people v. valenzuela (2009) 172 cal.app.4th 1246, 1250.) because the court did not impose these additional mandatory assessments when it imposed the fee pursuant to health and safety code section 11372.7, subdivision (a), we presume the court did not thus, the parties agreeas do wethat ability to pay the fee imposed by health and safety code section 11372.7, subdivision (b) in light of her total financial obligations. (see people v. johnson (2015) 234 cal.app.4th 1432, 1459 (johnson).) appellant has the burden on remand to demonstrate her inability to pay. (valenzuela, supra, at p. 1250.) 2. sentencing minute order several courts have approved of the practice of trial courts orally imposing the penalty assessments on the fees pursuant to health and safety code sections 11372.5 and see 6 people v. hamed (2013) 221 cal.app.4th 928, 939-940; people v. voit (2011) 200 cal.app.4th 1353, 1373; sharret, supra, 191 cal.app.4th at p. 864.) but the court must ensure the sentencing minute order and abstract of judgment set forth the specific amounts and statutory authority for each penalty and surcharge. (johnson, supra, 234 cal.app.4th at p. 1459; hamed, supra, at p. 940; sharret, supra, at p. 864.) as we explained above, the court imposed the drug program fee pursuant to health and safety code section 11372.7 without the mandatory additional assessments. at the sentencing hearing, the court also orally imposed the crime laboratory drug penalty assessments.1 while that was permissible, the sentencing minute order failed to list the specific penalty amounts and their statutory bases. following the proceedings on fee, the court must ensure the sentencing minute order sets forth the amount and statutory authority for each penalty assessment attached to the fees imposed by health and safety code sections 11372.5 and 11372.7.2 (see sharret, supra, 191 cal.app.4th at pp. 863-864.) disposition the imposition of the drug program fee pursuant to health and safety code section 11372.7, subdivision (a) is reversed. upon issuance of the remittur, the trial court is directed the drug program fee pursuant to health and safety code section 11372.7, subdivision (a) in light of the additional mandatory penalty assessments . if appellant has the ability to pay, the drug program fee is to be reinstated with the additional penalty 1 the same penalty assessments apply to health and safety code sections 11372.5 and 11372.7. (sharret, supra, 191 cal.app.4th at pp. 863-864.) 2 the sentencing minute order reflects the court separately imposed a $20 state-only dna penalty (gov. code,  76104.7, subd. (a)), which was part of the penalties attached to the $50 crime laboratory drug analysis fee pursuant to health and safety code section 11372.5. (see sharret, supra, 191 cal.app.4th at p. 864.) 7 assessments. the superior court is directed to ensure the sentencing minute order properly lists the amounts and statutory authority for each penalty assessment. in all other respects, the judgment is affirmed. flier, j. we concur: rubin, acting p. j. grimes, j.
