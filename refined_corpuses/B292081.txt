(see people v. wilson (oct. 31, 2015, b260281) [nonpub. opn.].) on remand the trial court found wilson was ineligible for resentencing on that conviction because he intended to cause great bodily injury during the commission of the offense. in this, his second appeal challenging denial of relief under proposition 36, wilson argues substantial evidence did not support the trial we affirm. factual and procedural background a. wilson attacks the mother of his child wilson lived in an apartment with his girlfriend belinda p., their child, and four of belinda one day wilson came home drunk. wilson and belinda argued, and the dispute escalated into mutual shoving, in the bedroom. wilson, a large man, grabbed 1 statutory references are to the penal code. 3 belinda face with one hand, and tore her skin with his fingernails. wilson pushed belinda into a glass table, causing it to shatter and injure her. wilson left the room and, at some point, threatened to kill belinda and one of her children. wilson went to the kitchen and returned with a knife. he moved toward belinda blocked him. wilson stabbed her with the knife several times. belinda fled the apartment. belinda sustained lacerations on the side of her head and across her arms. she also suffered -puncture wounds on her hands. b. the jury convicts wilson, and the trial court sentences him in november 1996 a jury convicted wilson of inflicting corporal injury on the mother of his child, in violation of section 273.5, subdivision (a) (count 1); making a criminal threat, in violation of section 422 (count 2); and assault with a deadly weapon or by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury, in violation of former section 245, subdivision (a)(1) (count 3).2 count 1 involved the mutual shoving and wilson pushing belinda into the glass table, while counts 2 and 3 involved the death threat and the stabbing. the jury also found true allegations wilson personally used a dangerous weapon within the meaning of section 12022, subdivision (b), had a prior serious 2 amended to separate the people v. gallardo (2017) 4 cal.5th 120, 125, fn. 1.) 4 felony conviction within the meaning of section 667, subdivision (a)(1), had four serious or violent felony convictions within the meaning of the three strikes law (former  667, subds.

(see people v. wilson, supra, b260281.) on july 19, 2018 the trial court found beyond a reasonable doubt wilson was armed with a knife and intended to cause great bodily injury during the commission of count 1, and 5 the court ruled wilson was ineligible for resentencing. wilson timely appealed. discussion a. applicable law in 2012 the voters enacted section 1170.126, which allows an eligible defendant serving an indeterminate life sentence as a third strike offender for a felony that is not serious or violent to petition for recall of the third strike sentence.

[citation.] the procedures call for two determinations. first, an inmate must be eligible for resentencing. ( 1170.126, subd. (e)(2).) an inmate is eligible for resentencing if his or her current sentence was not imposed for a violent or serious felony and was not imposed for any of the offenses described in clauses (i) to (iv) of section 1170.12, subdivision (c)(2)(c). ( 1170.126, subd. (e)(2).) those clauses describe certain kinds of criminal conduct, including the use of a firearm during the commission of the offense. second, an inmate must be suitable for resentencing. even if eligible, a defendant is unsuitable for resentencing determines that resentencing the petitioner would pose an unreasonable risk o 1170.126, subd. third strike sentence is recalled, and the inmate is resentenced to a second people v. estrada (2017) 3 cal.5th 6 661, 667.) the court must determine eligibility on a count-by-count basis.
