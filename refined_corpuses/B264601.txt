(b)-(i)).1 the trial court sentenced suarez to a three strikes term of 64 years to life in state prison. (the judgment was affirmed on appeal in people v. suarez (oct. 29, 2013, b240911) [nonpub. opn.].) on july 21, 2014, following the passage of proposition 36,2 suarez, acting in propria persona, filed a petition for recall of his sentence. on july 29, 2014, the trial court denied the petition on the ground that suarez was ineligible for resentencing under proposition 36 because one of his current convictions (spousal battery) included an enhancement finding for use of a deadly weapon. suarez did not appeal this ruling. instead, on march 3, 2015, he filed a second petition for recall of his sentence. on march 16, 2015, the trial court denied this petition on the ground it had already denied . the court explained that notice of appeal. suarez thereafter filed a notice of appeal on may 11, 2015. we appointed counsel to represent suarez on appeal. after reviewing the record, counsel filed an opening brief requesting this court to independently review the record pursuant to people v. wende (1979) 25 cal.3d 436, 441. we directed counsel to send the record on appeal and a copy of the opening brief to suarez and notified suarez that he had 30 days within which to personally submit any contentions or issues that he wished us to consider. suarez has filed a supplemental brief.3 1 all further statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise specified. 2 the passage of proposition 36 resulted in the enactment of section 1170.126. 3 6, 2016, shall be deemed filed as of the date of the filing of this opinion. 3 we have examined the entire record and determined that, as the trial court found, suarez is ineligible for a reduction of his sentence under proposition 36 because he has a disqualifying current conviction. as we explained in people v. superior court (kaulick) (2013) 215 cal.app.4th 36, the three strikes reform act of 2012 (the act). under the three strikes law (pen. code,  667, subds. (b)-(i), 1170.12) as it existed prior to proposition 36, a defendant convicted of two prior serious or violent felonies would be subject to a sentence of 25 years to life upon conviction of a third felony. under the act, however, a defendant convicted of two prior serious or violent felonies is subject to the 25-year-to-life sentence only if the third felony is itself a serious or violent felony. if the third felony is not a serious or violent felony, the defendant will receive a sentence as though the defendant had only one prior serious or violent felony conviction, and is therefore a second strike, rather than a third strike, offender. the act also provides a means whereby prisoners currently serving sentences of 25 years to life for a third felony conviction which was not a serious or violent felony may seek court review of their indeterminate sentences and, under certain circumstances, obtain resentencing as if they had only one prior serious or violent felony conviction. according to the specific language of the act, however, a current inmate is not entitled to id. at pp. 1285-irst part is prospective only, reducing the sentence to be imposed in future three strike cases where the third strike is not a serious or violent felony (pen. code,  667, 1170.12); the second part is retrospective, providing similar, but not identical, relief for prisoners already serving third strike sentences in cases where the third strike was not a serious or violent felony (pen. code,  id. at p. 1292.) subdivision (e)(2) of section 1170.126 provides that an inmate who is otherwise quimposed for any of the offenses appearing in clauses (i) to (iii), inclusive, of subparagraph (c) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (e) of section 667 or clauses (i) to (iii), 4 inclusive, of subparagraph (c) of paragraph (2) of subdivision clause commission of the current offense, the defendant used a firearm, was armed with a one of current convictions was for inflicting corporal injury on a spouse, during which offense he used (and was, therefore, armed with)4 a deadly weapon a pair of scissors. the trial court properly determined suarez was ineligible for resentencing under proposition 36. we are satisfied that defense counsel has fully complied with his responsibilities and that no arguable appellate issue exists.
