(people v. lynall (2015) 233 cal.app.4th 1102, 1108.) proposition 47 provides, in pertinent a person . . . [currently] serving a sentence for a conviction . . . of a felony . . . who would have been guilty of a misdemeanor under the act . . . had this act been in effect at the time of the offense may petition for a recall of sentence . . . to request resentencing in accordance with sections 11350, 11357, or 11377 of the health and safety code, or section 459.5, 473, 476a, 490.2, 496, or 666 of the penal code, as those sections have been amended or added by 1170.18, subd. (a).) section 1170.18, subdivision (f) conviction, whether by trial or plea, of a felony or felonies who would have been guilty of a misdemeanor under this act had this act been in effect at the time of the offense, may file an application before the trial court that entered the judgment of conviction in his or her case to have the felony conviction or understanding that the primary purpose of prop 47, is to classify the level of charges between a felony and misdemeanor, based not only on the penal statute charged, but more importantly on the so. rather, 4 proposition 47 is conviction-based. section 1170.18, subdivision (a) lists the specific drug and theft crimes that proposition 47 subjected to potential reduction from felonies to misdemeanors. robbery is not included as one of the offenses subject to proposition 47. rodabaugh argues that even the trial court struggled with the question of whether the evidence met the requirements for convictions under the robbery statute; i.e., whether there was sufficient force involved in these purse snatchings to warrant a conviction for robbery rather than mere theft. however, the law is clear that robbery requires the defendant to have taken the such force as is actually sufficient to overcome the victims resistance . . . . (people v. burns (2009) 172 cal.app.4th 1251, 1259, italics added; see also people v. abilez (2007) 41 cal.4th 472, 507 [ settled that a victim of robbery may be unconscious or even dead when the property is taken, so long as the defendant used force against t [citations.] there is no requirement a victim be aware that someone was taking his or ].) by pleading no contest to robbery, rodabaugh admitted that he used force or fear to commit the purse snatchings. rodabaugh claims that, despite the explicit language of section 1170.18, he is entitled to proposition 47 relief because his section 969f. but that statute has no effect on the nature of the 969f . . . was enacted in order to prequalify a crime as a serious felony 5 prosecutor to reprove [sic] a previous conviction when it is alleged that people v. leslie (1996) 47 cal.app.4th 198, 204.) 969f was introduced as a measure to aid the prosecution in not having to go through the time and expense to prove that a prior conviction was a serious felony. it is therefore a measure enacted solely for the benefit of the prosecution. if the court or counsel choose (or forget) to comply with section 969f, then in a subsequent case, the district attorney, instead of having slam-a serious felony, will be saddled with the burden of proving the id. at p. 205.) that convictions were never to him here. we are satisfied that appellate counsel has fully complied with his responsibilities and that no arguable appellate issue exists.
