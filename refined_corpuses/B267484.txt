filed 6/30/16 p. v. williams ca2/2 not to be published in the official reports california rules of court, rule 8.1115(a), prohibits courts and parties from citing or relying on opinions not certified for publication or ordered published, except as specified by rule 8.1115(b). this opinion has not been certified for publication or ordered published for purposes of rule 8.1115. in the court of appeal of the state of california second appellate district division two the people, plaintiff and respondent, v. lamar edward williams, defendant and appellant. b267484 (los angeles county super. ct. no. ba412265) appeal from a judgment of the superior court of los angeles county. dennis j. landin, judge. affirmed. vanessa place, under appointment by the court of appeal, for defendant and appellant. kamala d. harris, attorney general, gerald a. engler, chief assistant attorney general, lance e. winters, senior assistant attorney general, shawn mcgahey webb, supervising deputy attorney general, and ilana herscovitz, deputy attorney general, for plaintiff and respondent. * * * * * * 2 lamar edward williams (defendant) appeals his convictions of forcible oral copulation and aggravated kidnapping, as well as the ensuing 100-years-to-life prison sentence, on the ground that the trial court abused its discretion in excluding evidence that his victim had, the year before, loitered for the purposes of prostitution. we conclude the court did not abuse its discretion, and affirm. facts and procedural background i. facts in april 2009, defendant approached s.l. two or three times as she walked away from a bus stop. the last time he approached her, defendant had one of his hands in the pocket of the hoodie he was wearing, told her in an agitated voice that he had a gun, and ordered her into a nearby dark alley. once in the alley, defendant removed s.l.pants, performed oral sex on her and ordered her to perform oral sex on him; when he ejaculated, she spat it out. s.l. reported to some persons (but not to others) that she also performed oral sex on defendant a second time and that defendant attempted to have vaginal sex with her. once the sex acts were completed, defendant walked s.l. back to the alley and told her to wait there until he left in his car. in may 2012, law enforcement showed s.l. a photospread and she identified defendant as her assailant. after this identification, law enforcement compared semen collected from s.l. chin immediately after the assault; there was a match. law enforcement questioned defendant. he indicated that he did not know s.l., was unfamiliar with the neighborhood where the assault took place, and had been intimate with only two people in 2009: (1) his wife; and (2) the mother of his children. ii. procedural history the people charged defendant with two counts of forcible oral copulation (pen. code,  288a, subd. (c)(2))1, a single count of aggravated kidnapping ( 209, subd. (b)(1)), and a single count of second degree robbery ( 211). as to all but the 1 all further statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise indicated. 3 robbery, the people further alleged that defendant personally used a dangerous or deadly weapon ( 667.61, subds. (a), (d)(1) & (e)(3)). the people also alleged that defendant had 30 prior strikes within the meaning of our three strikes law ( 667, subds. (b)-(j) & 1170.12, subds. (a)-(d)), and that his 1989 forcible oral copulation and rape conviction constituted a prior strike under our one strike law ( 667.61, subds. (a), (d)(1)). the people moved to exclude, and defendant moved to admit, s.l. arrest for loitering for the purpose of prostitution ( 653.22, subd. (a)), her resulting conviction for disturbing the peace ( 415), and her admission to police that she had in fact been loitering for prostitution. defendant sought to admit this evidence to impeach s.l. and to prove that she consented to the sex acts in the alley. the trial court ultimately excluded the evidence, citing evidence code section 352. at trial, defendant testified. contradicting what he told police in 2012, defendant testified that he and s.l. were in the midst of a consensual, sexual relationship; that she repaid him money she owed him, willingly had oral sex with him and willingly allowed him to perform oral sex on her in april 2009; that he suspected she had been sexually intimate with another man earlier that day; that s.l. admitted she had been with another man that day who had given her the money she used to repay defendant; that defendant asked her to leave; and that she warned him that he would regret his actions because the parties stipulated that s.l. and her boyfriend had consensually had sex earlier in the same day as the sexual assault and that the boyfriend had ejaculated. a jury found defendant guilty of both forcible oral copulation counts and of aggravated kidnapping, found true the allegation that he had used a dangerous or deadly weapon, and found true the allegation that his 1989 conviction qualified as a prior under the one strike law; the jury acquitted defendant of robbery. after waiving his rights, defendant admitted his other prior convictions. the trial court imposed a sentence of 100 years to life in prison. specifically, the court imposed a 75-year-to-life sentence on the first forcible oral copulation count, calculated as a 25-year-to-life sentence under the one strike law that is tripled under the three strikes law. the court imposed another 75-year-to-life sentence on the second oral 4 copulation count, to run concurrently. and the court imposed a consecutive 25-year-to-life sentence on the aggravated kidnapping count under the three strikes law. defendant timely appeals. discussion defendant argues that the trial court abused its discretion in excluding s.l.arrest, conviction and conduct to impeach her testimony and to prove her consent to the charged sex acts. because s.l.people v. medina (1995) 11 ssible, whether as proof of guilt or not a crime of moral turpitude (e.g., people v. contreras (2013) 58 cal.4th 123, 157, fn. 24 [only convictions for crimes of moral turpitude are admissible for impeachment purposes]; wyatt v. cerf (1944) 64 cal.app.2d 732, 738 [disturbing the peace is not a crime of moral turpitude]),2 the chief issue before us is whether the court erred in excluding evidence that s.l. engaged in underlying conduct constituting the crime of loitering for prostitution (people v. wheeler (1992) 4 cal.4th 284, 295 (wheeler), superseded on other grounds by evid. code,  452.5; contreras, at p. 157, fn. 24; people v. rivera (2003) 107 cal.app.4th 1374, 1380). be id.,  1103, subd. (c)(5)). these statutes nonetheless role of evidence code section 352 in authorizing [a] trial court to exclude relevant people v. casas (1986) 181 cal.app.3d 889, 896; people v. fontana (2010) 49 cal.4th 351, 362.) 2 we accordingly have no occasion to assess whether her misdemeanor conviction is barred by the hearsay rule. (cf. evid. code,  452.5.) 5 under evidence code section 352, a trial court if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the probability that its admission will (a) necessitate undue consumption of time or (b) create substantial danger of undue considerations to the decision whether to admit prior misdemeanor conduct to impeach a witness(2) [the conduct] is for the same or similar effect . . . admission [of that conduct] would have on the d(people v. clark (2011) 52 cal.4th 856, 931-932, citing people v. beagle (1972) 6 cal.3d 441, 452), or any other conduct not amounting to a felonyis a less forceful indicator of immoral character or dishonesty than is a felony problems of proof, unfair surprise, and moral turpitude evaluation which felony convictions do not present(wheeler, supra, 4 cal.4th at pp. 296-297). a trial court has clark, at pp. 931-932; people v. rioz (1984) 161 cal.app.3d 905, 916 (rioz)[t]his discretion allows the trial court broad power to control the presentation of proposed impeachment evidence to prevent criminal trials from degenerating into nitpicking wars of attrition over [citatio (people v. lightsey (2012) 54 cal.4th 668, 714.) our review is confined to assessing whether the trial court has abused its discretion. (ibid.) we conclude there was no abuse of discretion. as an initial matter, s.l.amounts at most to a misdemeanor, which raises wheeler, supra, 4 cal.4th at pp. 296-297.) to be sure, this evidence has some marginal probative value. the crime of prostitutionand hence loitering for purposes of prostitutionis a crime of moral turpitude (people v. chandler (1997) 56 cal.app.4th 703, 708-709), and thus has some bearing on s.l.ty or veracity. but the light it sheds is weak. 6 s.l. conduct also occurred a year before, and 10 miles away from the location of, the charged sexual assaults. accordingly, her prior conduct is remote in time. it is also dissimilar to the charged crimes, which were either coerced (according to s.l.) or part of s.l. for sex. defendant testified, and nothing in the record indicated that the admission or exclusion of this evidence affected his decision to do so. what is more, evidence that s.l. once loitered for prostitution runs the risk of confusing the issues of consent and credibility. (rioz, supra, 161 cal.app.3d at p. 919 reat care must be taken to insure [the] exception to the general rule barring evidence of a complaining w. . does not impermissibly encroach upon admitting otherwise inadmissible evidencit also comes dangerously close to assertingas defendant argued to the trial courtthat s.l. is a liar because she once attempted to be a prostitute. (accord, people v. varona (1983) 143 cal.app.3d 566, 569-e do not . . . hold that in every rape case where the [victim] is a prostitute, evidence of that fact must be admitted to show consentpeople v. steele (1989) 210 cal.app.3d 67, 75-76 [evidence that victim once previously had sex with a stranger properly excluded from use as impeachment evidence].) in sum, the trial court acted well within its discretion. defendant raises two further arguments. first, he argues that the trial court was r of his 30 prior convictions but excluding s.l. thoughtfully applied the pertinent law to each set of convictionssuggestion, there is no rule requiring absolute parity in the admission of prior s.l.misconduct amounted to a limitation on his right to cross-examine her that violates his constitutional right to confront witnesses. although the right to confrontation can be -examination would have produced a significantly people v. capistrano (2014) 7 59 e ordinary rules of evidence generally does not impermissibly infringe uponpeople v. casares (2016) 62 cal.4th 808, 830). as we explain above, the court here properly applied evidence code section 352. moreover, the court gave defendant ample leeway to cross-examine s.l. on the inconsistencies in her accounts of what happened as she recounted the assault to the to confrontation were not violated. disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. _______________________, j. hoffstadt we concur: ________________________, p.j. boren ________________________, j. ashmann-gerst
