(people v. kelly (2006) 40 cal.4th 106, 109-110; people v. wende, supra, 25 cal.3d at p. 441.) hodgess guilty plea/admission of probation violation and failure to obtain a certificate of probable cause limit the potential scope of her appeal to [g]rounds that arose after entry of the plea and do not affect the pleas validity or [t]he denial of a motion to suppress evidence under penal code section 1538.5. (cal. rules of court, rule 8.304(b); see pen. code,  1237.5.) hodgess letter does not raise, and the record does not demonstrate, the existence of any such issue. disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published. chaney, j. we concur: mallano, p. j. rothschild, j.
