(crocker national bank, at p. 888.) we review conditions of probation for abuse of discretion. (people v. olguin (2008) 45 cal.4th 375, 384 (olguin); people v. acosta (2018) 20 cal.app.5th 225, 229.) section 597 not unconstitutionally vague the court instructed the jury with caljic no. 14.98, which tracked the animal cruelty statute codified at section 597 under which appellant was convicted. as read to the jury, the instruction stated in pertinent part: subdivision (b) of the penal code, a crime. [] . . . [] in order to prove this crime, each of the following elements must be proved. [] 1. a person cruelly beat, mutilated, or cruelly killed an animal or caused or procured an animal to be tortured, tormented, cruelly beaten, mutilated, or cruelly killed, or, if the person had the charge and custody of an animal, either as an owner or otherwise, inflicted unnecessary cruelty upon an animal, or in any appellant contends the following phrases (which are italicized above) are unconstitutionally vague: 4 and, necessary cruelty.2 people v. speegle (1997) 53 cal.app.4th 1405, 1410-1411 (speegle), which rejected a vagueness-challenge to section 597 under which appellant was convicted, illustrates why. in speegle, the defendant was convicted of cruelty to scores of animals in violation of section 597 by keeping them in filthy conditions and denying them food and water. although speegle involved statutory terms different from those appellant challenges, the analysis for unconstitutional vagueness was similar. the defendant in speegle asserted the following terms were vague: shelter; and, speegle observed that a statute barring animal cruelty necessarily must be expansive in its language. speegle infinite number of ways in which the callously indifferent can subject animals in their care to conditions which make the humane cringe. it is thus impossible for the legislature to speegle, supra, 2 appellant asserts other words in the statute, such as but appellant lacks standing to argue the point on appeal because (tobe v. city of santa ana (1995) 9 cal.4th 1069, 1095.) 5 53 cal.app.4th at p. 1411.) speegle held that a statute can pass ireasonableness applies to the challenged language, making its ibid.according to speeglespecifications of the acts or conduct prohibited. the requirement of reasonable certainty does not preclude the use of ordinary terms to express ideas [with] adequate interpretation in common usage and understanding. [citation.] so long as the language embodies (ibid.) speegle applies here. speegle standard of reasonableness in the provision of sustenance, drink, and shelter, and in the avoidance of infliction of suffering. the (speegle, supra, 53 cal.app.4th at p. 1411.) likewise here. the meaning of the phrases that appellant challenges objectidue process does not require any more. (ibid.) appellant contends johnson v. united states (2015) __ u.s. __ [135 s.ct. 2551] (johnson) establishes a more exacting constitutional standard than speegle. appellant is mistaken because the purported statutory vagueness that johnson analyzed differed from the purported vagueness of section 597. 6 johnson offense of unlawful possession of a short-barreled shotgun and the federal armed career criminal act (acca). (18 u.s.c.  924(e)(2)(b).) acca increased the prison sentence for certain categories of offenders who had three or more prior convictions attempted, or threatened physical force against another person; (2) certain enumerated offenses; or, (3) a crime that otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another (johnson, supra, 135 s.ct. at p. 2562; people v. frandsen (2019) 33 cal.app.5th 1126, 1139 (frandsen).) upholding a vagueness challenge to acca, johnson found -fold. (johnson, supra, 135 s.ct. at pp. 2557-2558; frandsen, supra, 33 cal.app.5th at p. 1140.) first, the residual clause spoke of elements. the focus on conduct determine whether a felony is violent, one looks to the sentencing commission of the particular offense at issue was violent. (johnson, at p. 2557; frandsen, at p. 1140.) illustrating by way of example, johnson noted that inquiring into the character of k place in, for example, a home occupied at night or an empty home during the day. (johnson, at p. 2558.) or, if the felony were 7 involved, say, threats of force against the victim or, perhaps, a letter threatening to reveal personal information. (ibid.) because no obvious method exists to predict beforehand how a as opposed to consulting a atutory elements in the penal code a criminal vagueness doctrine aims to avoid. (johnson, at p. 2556 [due process condemns vagueness in a criminal statute because vague language does not give an ordinary person notice of conduct that the statute criminalizes and invites arbitrary government enforcement].) the second vagueness infirmity that johnson identified what qualifie emerges from the first infirmity. the law recognizes that, generally speaking, challenges because people are capable of following laws that involve qualitative standards; in other words, people are capable of knowing what they must do to obey a law banning, for example, violent conduct. (johnson, supra, 135 s.ct. at p. 2561; frandsen, supra, 33 cal.app.5th at p. 1141.) but johnson ade conforming behavior to the qualitative terms of the second infirmity impossible. in other words, while not all qualitative terms are vague, they are vague under the circumstances of acca. (johnson, at p. 2558; frandsen, at p. 1141.) the two-fold infirmity that johnson identified in acca does not apply to the animal-cruelty statute codified at section 8 do not suffer from first infirmity. accordingly, they survive a vagueness-challenge resting on analysis. -challenge additionally fails for a second reason separate from the inapplicability of analysis to section 597. that second reason is a defendant cannot raise a vagueness-challenge if the statute clearly prohibits the er a statute is vague as engages in some conduct that is clearly proscribed cannot complain of the vagueness of the law as applied to the conduct of holder v. humanitarian law project (2010) 561 u.s. 1, 18-19, 20 (holder); see in re gary h. (2016) 244 cal.app.4th 1463, 1476 [relying on holder to uphold vagueness challenge to school-loitering law].) johnson neither changed the legal rule undergirding the second reason nor overruled it. (people v. superior court (j.c. penney corp., inc.) 34 cal.app.5th 376, 386, 403 [johnson did not overrule leading cases articulating rule as stated in village of hoffman estates v. flipside, hoffman estates, inc. (1982) 455 u.s. 489 and holder, supra, 561 u.s. 1].) as our colleagues in division four recently explained, federal and state courts continue to uphold statutes against vagueness challenges after johnson (j.c. penney corp., inc., at pp. 403-404 and cases cited therein.) we reject at the threshold [the] contention that a specific rule for evaluating facial challenges was abrogated in johnson v. united states (2015) ___ u.s. ___ [135 s.ct. 2551] 9 (johnson). under that rule . . . [citations], a facial challenge fails conduct. we conclude that the rule retains its vitality post-johnson id., at pp. 385-386; see people v. ledesma (2017) 14 cal.app.5th 830, 838-839 [rejected argument that johnson announced a new test for unconstitutional vagueness].) people v. thomason (2000) 84 cal.app.4th 1064, 1070 is instructive. in that case, the defendant made a commercial video recording a woman crushing mice and rats with her bare feet or in high heels. a jury convicted the defendant for violating section maliciously and intentionally maims, mutilates, tortures, or wounds a living animal, or maliciously and intentionally kills an animal, is guilty of an offense punishable by imprisonment in the state prison . . . .unconstitutionally vague because it did not distinguish between unlawfully killing a rodent and doing so lawfully, such as a pest-exterminator ridding a home of rodent infestation. (thomason, at p. 1070.) on review, the court of appeal found the defendant lacked standing to raise a vagueness challenge. the court of learly applies to a criminal defendants conduct, the defendant may not challenge it on ibid.) appellant advances no argument how the statutory language she challenges cruelly beat; caused to be tortured, tormented, or cruelly beaten; inflicted unnecessary cruelty is too vague for a reasonable jury, relying on those meanings, could not apply the statute to her conduct. perhaps on the margin the terms might not be clear, but the facts of this case do not lie on the margin any reasonable person knows that 10 beating and choking a dog causing it to bleed and gasp for air, challenge thus fails. no sua sponte duty to define torment, torture, and cruelty the trial court instructed the jury with caljic no. 14.98, caljic no. 14.98, which tracks section 597, does not define whereby unnecessary or unjustifiable physical pain or suffering is e jury.3 appellant contends the trial court erred in not instructing with section 599b. according to appellant, the court needed to suffering was a necessary part of the definitions of torment, torture, and cruelty. (see people v. chaffin (2009) 173 cal.app.4th 1348, 1351 [trial court has sua sponte duty to define terms not used in their ordinary meaning].) appellant contends al error akin to not instructing a jury with an element of the offense to which chapman error applies. (chapman v. california (1967) 386 u.s. 18.) under chapman, the people must prove beyond a 3 the prosecutor argued act, failure to act, neglect that causes or permits unnecessary or 11 reasonable doubt that the error was harmless. (neder v. united states (1999) 527 u.s. 1, 15.) appellant cites no authority, however, that a statutory definition is the same as an element. purported error is reviewed for chapman error. on the other hand, assuming solely for the sake of to define those words for watson error, which applies to instructional error of non-constitutional dimensions. (people v. watson (1956) 46 cal.2d 818, 836.) under watson, the defendant must show a reasonable probability of a more favorable trial people v. beltran (2013) 56 cal.4th 935, 955.) we conclude that tin not telling the jury that torment, torture, and cruelty involved punched tigra. she hit tigra with a cable, drawing blood. she hoisted tigra by her collar, causing tigra to gasp for breath. it is improbable that the jury would have concluded tigra did not feel unnecessary or unjustifiable physical pain or suffering. probation condition allowing warrantless searches of electronic devices not unconstitutionally overbroad the court imposed a probation condition requiring appellant to submit to warrantless searches of her electronic property to search and seizure at any time of the day or night by any peace officer, probation officer or animal control officer with or without a warrant, probable cause or reasonable suspicion. you are, specifically, waiving all rights to privacy in your 12 electronic information, as well as, those specified in penal code sections 1546 through 1546.4. [electronic communications appellant contends the condition is overbroad because it violates her first amendment rights of privacy and freedom of speech and her fourth amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches. we find appellant has forfeited her contention, however, because she did not object when the trial court imposed the condition. (people v. relkin (2016) 6 cal.app.5th 1188, 1194-1195.) appellant asserts forfeiture does not apply because her overbreadth claim presents a pure question of law. (in re sheena k. (2007) 40 cal.4th 875, 887.) but appellant is mistaken because the facts of her case affect the appropriateness of the probation condition, and thus the probation condition does not present a pure question of law. (id., at p. 885 [forfeiture appropriate because trial court better positioned than court of appeal to assess facts supporting probation condition].) no error under people v. lent appellant contends warrantless searches of her electronic devices as a condition of probation violates people v. lent (1975) 15 cal.3d 481. lent establishes that a probation condition is inoffender was convicted, (2) relates to conduct which is not in itself criminal, and (3) requires or forbids conduct which is not reasonably related to future criminality . . . (id. at p. 486.) this test is conjunctive (people v. olguin, supra, 4 cal.4th at p. 379.) appellant forfeited her contention of lent-error by not raising it at trial. (people v. relkin, supra, 6 cal.app.4th at pp. 13 1194-1195; people v. moran (2016) 1 cal.5th 398, 404, fn. 7; people v. welch (1993) 5 cal.4th 228, 237.) the exception to forfeiture involving pure questions of law does not apply because as noted above, the appropriateness of the warrantless search of tronic devices turns on questions of fact.4 electronic search condition does not violate electronic communications privacy act section 1546.1, subdivision (c)(10) permits the government to search an electronic device as a condition of probation unless federal law otherwise forbids the search. ( 1546.1, subd. (c)(10) [government may search electronic device as condition of probation].) appellant contends the united states constitution prohibits the warrantless electronic search condition imposed here, and thus subdivision (c)(10) does not apply. in support of her contention that the search condition violates federal law, appellant cites riley v. california (2014) 573 u.s. 373, which acknowledged the privacy implications of searching cell phones because of the amount of private information the phones contain. riley is inapposite, however, because it involved warrantless searches incident to arrest, not probation conditions imposed, as 4 appellant contends her trial counsel provided ineffective assistance by not objecting to the warrantless search condition. contention. (people v. mendoza tello (1997) 15 cal.4th 264, 266.) generally speaking, the vehicle by which appellant may pursue her claim for ineffective assistance of counsel is by writ of habeas corpus. (people v. lucas (2014) 60 cal.4th 153, 307, disapproved on another ground in people v. romero (2015) 62 cal.4th 1.) 14 in this case, after conviction. (id. at pp. 378, 382; see in re j.e. (2016) 1 cal.app.5th 795, 804 review granted october 12, 2016, s236628 [riley permission for change of residence the court imposed as a condition of probation that appellant receive permission from her probation officer to change residence as approved by the probation officer and keep the probation officer advised of your work and home address and the condition, thus forfeiting the issue on appeal. (people v. relkin, supra, 6 cal.app.4th at pp. 1194-1195.) because there are facts under which a residency condition can be appropriate, forfeiture people v. stapleton (2017) 9 cal.app.5th 989, 995-996 [upholding residency condition based of substance abuse, and need to ensure he did not live where drugs were used or sold]; see in re sheena k, supra, 40 cal.4th at p. 885 [forfeiture applies to probation condition linked to in imposing the condition. 15 disposition the judgment is affirmed. leis, j.* we concur: chaney, acting p. j. bendix, j. * judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
