(a)) and receiving a stolen motor vehicle (pen. code,  496d, subd. (a)).1 after barraza waived his right to jury trial on the prior conviction allegations, the trial court found he had suffered two prior convictions for unlawfully driving or taking a vehicle within the meaning of section 666.5; had conviction for robbery ( 211, 1170.12, subd. (b), 667, subds. (b) (i)); and had served a prior prison term within the meaning of section 667.5, subdivision (b). the trial court sentenced barraza to a term of eight years in prison. it imposed, inter alia, a restitution fine, a suspended parole restitution fine, a court operations assessment, and a criminal conviction assessment. barraza appeals. discussion the trial court did not commit instructional error 1. additional facts the parties agreed upon a special instruction, which was given by the trial court, as follows: statement of a defendant are legal issues decided by the judge and are not issues decided by the jury. [] the jury is not to consider the lawfulness of any stops, seizures, or searches made by the police officers the trial court also instructed, inter alia, with the standard versions of calcrim nos. 223 (direct and circumstantial 1 all further undesignated statutory references are to the penal code. 4 evidence defined), 224 (sufficiency of circumstantial evidence), 225 (circumstantial evidence in regard to intent or mental state), and 358 (evidstatements). barraza contends the special instruction was ambiguous and its use was prejudicial error in regard to the vehicle code section 10851 count. 2. standard of review we independently determine whether the instructions given were correct and adequate. (people v. acosta (2014) 226 cal.app.4th 108, 119; people v. mathson (2012) 210 cal.app.4th 1297, 1311; people v. riley (2010) 185 cal.app.4th 754, 767.) when reviewing a purportedly ambiguous or misleading instruction, we inquire whether there is a reasonable likelihood the jury applied the challenged instruction in a way that violates the constitution. ((2016) 62 cal.4th 944, 991; people v. boyce (2014) 59 cal.4th 672, 714; people v. lopez (2011) 198 cal.app.4th 698, 708.)2 we consider the instructions as a whole, as well as the entire record of the trial, including the arguments of counsel. (, supra, at p. 991; people v. young (2005) 34 cal.4th 1149, 1202; people v. mcpheeters (2013) 218 cal.app.4th 124, 132.) we presume that the jurors are intelligent persons, capable of understanding and correlating the instructions given. (, supra, at p. 991; people v. gonzales (2011) 51 cal.4th 894, 940; lopez, supra, at p. 708.) instructions should be interpreted, if possible, so as to support the judgment rather than defeat it if they are reasonably susceptible to such interpretation. (riley, supra, at p. 767; lopez, supra, at p. 708.) 2 hachapman v. california he is incorrect. the reasonable likelihood standard is used to determine whether an instruction is impermissibly ambiguous or subject to misinterpretation, whereas the chapman standard pertains to the question of whether an error was harmless. (see people v. elguera (1992) 8 cal.app.4th 1214, 1220-1221.) isdirection of the jury, including incorrect, ambiguous, conflicting, or wrongly omitted instructions that do not amount to federal constitutional error are reviewed under the harmless error standard watson. (people v. chism (2014) 58 cal.4th 1266, 1299; people v. larsen (2012) 205 cal.app.4th 810, 829-830; people v. watson (1956) 46 cal.2d 818, 836.) 5 3. forfeiture barraza failed to object to the challenged instruction and in fact agreed it should be given. although a defendant may raise a claim that his substantial rights were affected by instructions to which he did not object, barraza fails to make such a showing here. (people v. gonzales, supra, 51 cal.4th at p. 938; see generally people v. coffman and marlow (2004) 34 cal.4th 1, 103, fn. 34;  1259.) as we explain post, the instruction was not erroneous. contention has been forfeited. (people v. anderson (2007) 152 cal.app.4th 919, 927 failure to object to instructional error forfeits the issue on appeal unless the error affects alternatively, barraza contends that his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance by agreeing to the instruction. because the instruction was not ambiguous and did not misstate the law, counsel was not ineffective for acquiescing in its use. (see, e.g., people v. kendrick (2014) 226 cal.app.4th 769, 780 [defense counsel is not required to indulge in idle acts to appear competent]; people v. szadziewicz (2008) 161 cal.app.4th 823, 836 s failure to make a futile or unmeritorious motion or request is not ineffective assistance].)3 4. discussion apart from the question of forfeiture, barrazhis argument runs as follows. to prove a violation of vehicle code section 10851, subdivision (a), the people had to prove he actually drove the explorer.4 (see calcrim 3 barraza additionally contends the invited error doctrine does not bar his challenge agreement to the instruction was a tactical choice. the people appear to agree that it tactical choice. (see people v. johnson (2016) 243 cal.app.4th 1247, 1267-1268.) in need not and do not reach the question of invited error. 4 vehicle code section 10851, subdivision (a) can be violated in two ways: the defendant can either drive or take the vehicle. (people v. garza (2005) 35 cal.4th 866, 6 no. 1820.) testimony that barraza told cobianand pulled over in order to call her. although the special instruction was legally correct, and the legal issues already determined by instead, it suggested all issues iability, had already been determined by the trial court and could not be considered by the jury. the instruction was therefore ambiguous and misleading. it hampered the defense efforts to convince , process rights. we disagree. the instruction was not misleading. it did not state or imply that the court had placed its sta. the instruction clearly not to consider the lawfulness of any stops, seizures, or searches made by the police officers in this case,any search by law taking of a statement the judge. (italics added.) this language did not state or imply that the jury was prohibited from considering ctually made or were reliable. easonable jurors would not have equestion there is no reasonable likelihood the instruction misled jurors into thinking they should not consider the credior the reliability ostatements. moreover, other instructions made clear that cobiajury. calcrim no. 358 provided: have heard evidence that the defendant made an oral [statement] before the trial [when] 876; people v. smith (2013) 57 cal.4th 232, 242.) here, the prosecutor opted to proceed on only the former theory. 7 the court was not in session. you must decide whether the defendant made any such statements, in whole or in part. if you decide that the defendant made such . . . statements, consider the statements, along with all the other evidence, in reaching your verdict. it is up to you to decide how much importance to give to the statements. [] consider with caution any statement made by the defendant tending to show his guilt jurors could not have read this instruction, yet mistakenly concluded liability or suggests. additionally, are. it is up to all of you, and you alone to decide what happened, based only on the evidence that has been presented to you from this instruction, jurors would explorer was accurate. the credibility or believability of the witnesses. in deciding whether testimony is true and calcrim no. 226 provided a series considered together, the instructions were not misleading. likewisethat the special instruction should be interpreted in the fashion barraza suggests. the parties did not argue that the to the contrary, their in light of his failure , and whether it was reasonable to believe barraza drove the explorer given n. these arguments would have made little sense if the trial court had already determined crane v. kentucky (1986) 476 u.s. 683, does not assist him. in crane, after a trial court fothe defense from introducing evidence about the physical and psychological environment 8 in which the confession had been obtained, reasoning that such evidence pertained solely to the issue of voluntariness that it had already decided. (id. at pp. 684, 686.) the supreme court held this deprived the defendant of a fair trial, because even when a confession is voluntary, evidence about the manner in which it was obtained is often highly relevant to its reliability and credibility. (id. at pp. 688-690 the court make a pretrial voluntariness reliability during the course of the trial].) but crane is distinguishable. first, unlike in crane, the trial court here did not preclude barraza from introducing evidence regarding the circumstances under which his admissions were obtained. second, as we have explained, nothing in the plain language of the special instruction expressly or impliedly precluded the jury from considering whether the circumstances suggested were unreliable. third, the defense did not proffer significant evidence suggesting that the circumstances of encounter with the deputies rendered his statements unreliable. in crane, for example, the defense evidence showed the 16-year-old defendant had been detained in a windowless room for a protracted period, had been surrounded by as many as six police officers during the interrogation, had repeatedly requested and been denied permission to telephone his mother, and had been badgered into making a false confession. (id. at p. 685.) nothing remotely similar occurred here. barraza furdeliberations indicated it misconstrued the special instruction. 1. the deputy considered the trial coplease refer to calcrim instructions 223. . ., 224. . . 9 no. 5 barraza contends that these questions indicated the jury was considering whether whether this was a factual issue for them to decide or whether it was a legal issue already we do not agree that the questions evidence jury confusion about whether statements at all is even less clear that the questions indicated hether either the existence of the statements or their reliability were factual issues. to the extent the questions indicated jurors were considering whether the statements were actually made, this was hardly surprising: must decide whether the defendant made any such statements, in whole or in if the jury was considering whether the statements were e statements. indeed, none of referenced or pertained to the special instruction. in our view, none indicated confusion about the in sum, in light of the instructions given anjuror would have concluded the court had already found barraza actually made admissions to deputy cobian, and that those admissions were reliable. 5 the jury also asked a third question: df -of-court statement made by the defendant. an out-of-court statement is made by the barraza appropriately does not contend this question indicated juror confusion. 10 disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports aldrich, j. we concur: edmon, p. j. lavin, j.
