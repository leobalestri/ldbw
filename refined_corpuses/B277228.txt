(a)(1)), possession of ammunition by a felon (former  12316, subd. (b)(1)), and possession of a controlled substance (health & saf. code,  11350, subd. (a)), and of misdemeanor possession of a smoking device (health & saf. code,  11364). the jury found true allegations that he had two , for robbery and voluntary manslaughter. the trial court sentenced ojeda , ordered him to pay a restitution fine, and imposed and stayed a parole restitution fine. in april 2013, ojeda filed a petition to recall his sentence under the three strikes reform act of 2012, added by proposition 36 and approved by the voters on november 6, 2012, which permits an inmate serving an indeterminate life sentence under the three strikes law for a nonviolent, nonserious felony to seek a new, lesser sentence, unless resentencing would pose an unreasonable risk to public safety. ( 1170.126, subds. (b), (e), (f).) after hearing argument, the trial court found ojeda was ineligible for resentencing because he had been armed with a firearm during the commission of his offenses. ojeda timely appealed. discussion ojeda contends he is eligible for resentencing. we disagree. section 1170.126 was added as part of the three strikes reform act. (voter information guide, text of prop. 36,  6, pp. 109-110.) among its stated purposes, as explained to voters, was 4 repeat offenders convicted of non-violent, non-serious crimes like shoplifting and simple drug possession will receive twice the normal sentence id.,  1, p. 105.) in accordance with these goals, section 1170.126 permits an inmate serving an indeterminate life sentence under the previous version of the three strikes law to petition for recall of the sentence and resentencing to a term that would have been imposed under the revised law. but subdivision (e)(2) of section 1170.126 provides that an inmate is ineligible for resentencing if the current sentence was imposed for an offense described in subdivision (e)(2)(c) of section 667. ( 1170.126, subd. (e)(2); people v. hicks (2014) 231 cal.app.4th 275, 282.)2 among the offenses described in subdivision (e)(2)(c) of section 667 is any offense during the com . . . was armed with a firearm or deadly weapon . . . .3 2 subdivision (e)(2) of section 1170.126 provides in pertinent part that an inmate is eligible for resentencing if the inmates current sentence was not imposed for any of the offenses appearing in clauses (i) to (iii), inclusive, of subparagraph (c) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (e) of section 667 3 subdivision (e)(2)(c)(iii) of section 667 disqualifies a uring the commission of the current offense, the defendant used a firearm, was armed with a firearm or deadly weapon, or intended to cause great bodily injury to another person. 5 possession of a firearm was armed with the firearm during the commission of that offense, the armed with a firearm exclusion applies and the deproposition 36. (people v. brimmer (2014) 230 cal.app.4th 782, 797; accord people v. white (2016) 243 cal.app.4th 1354, 1363-1365; people v. hicks, supra, 231 cal.app.4th at pp. 283-284; people v. elder (2014) 227 cal.app.4th 1308, 1312-1314, 1317; people v. osuna (2014) 225 cal.app.4th 1020, 1030-1032; people v. white (2014) 223 cal.app.4th 512, 525.) here, ojeda was armed with a gun during the commission of the offenses of possession of a firearm by a felon, which sufficed for the firearm exclusion to apply. ojeda argues that having been armed during the commission of possession of a firearm by a felon does not disqualify him from resentencing under proposition 36 because being armed is an element of the offense.4 he argues the armed with a firearm exclusion applies only when being armed is other offense. the argument is without merit. contrary to contention, being armed with a firearm is not an element of possession of a firearm by a felon. (see people v. brimmer, supra, 230 cal.app.4th at pp. 795, 799.) defendant possesses a weapon when it is under his dominion and people v. pea (1999) 74 cal.app.4th 1078, 108defendant is armed if the defendant has the specified weapon people v. bland 4 ojeda raises no arguments regarding the other offenses for which he was convicted. 6 or use. lives) is searched and a firearm is found next to his bed. the parolee is in possession of the firearm, because it is under his dominion and control. if he is not home at the time, however, he is not armed with the firearm, because it is not readily available to him for offensive or defensive use. accordingly, possessing a firearm does not necessarily constitute being armed with a people v. osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1030.) whether a felon in possession of a firearm was armed with the firearm at the time of the offense depends on the specific circumstances. (see ibid.) here, ojeda had a loaded handgun on his person as he was chased by police officers. thus, at the time that he possessed the firearm, ojeda also had it readily available for use. he was therefore proposition 36, which renders him ineligible for resentencing. the trial court correctly denied his recall petition. disposition the order dismissing petition is affirmed. not to be published. chaney, j. we concur: rothschild, p. j. johnson, j.
