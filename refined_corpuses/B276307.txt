lopez recognized defendant from previous contacts. defendant tried to distance himself from lopez by speeding away, then he parked the car and ran away on foot. lopez requested backup, and checked the license plate of the vehicle defendant had been driving. the vehicle had been reported as stolen on may 31, 2016. after backup arrived, defendant eventually emerged from a nearby residence and was arrested. defendant also submitted a printed document regarding [d] hood and cracked a vehicle report noted that the car had 314,821 miles on the odometer, and the car was in fair condition. two printouts from the kelley blue book website indicated that the private party value for a 1993 honda civic with 315,000 miles was $849 if the car was in fair condition, and $954 if the car was in good condition. the court considered defendantmotion at a hearing on july 6, 2016. defense counsel argued that the vehicle was worth less than $950 based on the kelley blue book values and the 4 police report noting that the vehicle was in fair condition, and therefore the charge should be reduced to a misdemeanor under section 490.2. the prosecutor argued that proposition 47 does not apply to section 10851. the court denied the motion and set the case for a preliminary hearing. at the preliminary hearing, lopez testified about the facts stated in his incident report. lopez testified that after defendant -de-sac, and defendant eventually emerged from one of the houses. dispatch told him the car had been reported stolen. lopez later spoke with the registered owner of the car by phone; the owner said he did not know defendant and had not given him permission to drive the car. defense counsel attempted to elicit additional information from lopez relevant to the argument that the vehicle was worth less than $950. objection, and stated that the court was conducting a probable cause hearing, not a motion hearing. in closing, defense counsel moved to dismiss the charge for insufficiency of the evidence and to reduce the charge to a misdemeanor under proposition 47. the court denied the motions and set an arraignment hearing. on july 20, 2016, defendant filed a notice of appeal, which judgment rendered on july 6, 2016, in department 4 of the los angeles superior court on august 1, 2016, the people filed a single-count information charging defendant with violating section 10851(a) and section 666.5. on august 20, 2016, defendant withdrew his plea of not guilty and pled no contest to the allegations. the 5 court sentenced defendant to four years in prison, consisting of the low term of two years plus two years pursuant to sections 667, subdivision (d) and 1170.12, subdivision (b). the court also imposed various fines and fees. defendant did not appeal from his conviction. discussion a. in his opening brief, defendant argues he is entitled to appeal the trial to reduce the charges against him evidence regarding the valuation of the 1993 honda automobile. defendant contends that proposition 47 applies to section 10851, and there was absolutely no evidence regarding the value of the honda upon which the court could find that the prosecution had met its burden of showing probable cause . . . necessary to bind [defendant] case over as felony grand theft. defendant also asserts that the filing of his notice of appeal as a result, defendant subsequent no contest iction he argues that in the alternative, his ature notice of appealtimely. the attorney general argues that the appeal should be dismissed for a variety of reasons. first, defendant appealed from a non-appealable order: authorized an appeal from thfinal judgment, [defendant] notice of appeal was not valid or operative and did not divest jurisdiction from the superior court. this appeal should be dismissed. the attorney general notes that defendant stated in his notice of appeal that his appeal was 6 from a judgment, and asserts could not divest the superior court of jurisdiction by falsely claiming to appeal from a second, because defendant pled no contest and did not get a certificate of probable cause as required by section 1237.5,2 the appeal must be dismissed and no relief from default is available. third, section 995 governs the hearing. because defendant did not move to set aside the information pursuant to section 995, he did not preserve this argument for appeal. in his reply, defendant appe the proper procedure, defendant says, would have been to file a writ of prohibition under section 999a. although defendanthe was appealing from a judgment, defendant blames the clerk for failing to correct his erroneous notice of appeal: clerk of the court properly recognized the technical defect in the defect, appellant could have timely corrected the deficiency and properly filed and labeled the filing as a notice for a writ of prohibition. thus, some of the noted deficiencies in the now 2 defendant from a judgment of conviction upon a plea of . . . nolo contendere . . . except where both of the following are met: (a) the defendant has filed with the trial court a written statement, executed under oath or penalty of perjury showing reasonable constitutional, jurisdictional, or other grounds going to the legality of the proceedings. (b) the trial court has executed and filed a certificate of probable cause for such appeal with the clerk 7 then preparing the defendant failure to note the filing deficiencies appeal as a petition for writ of prohibition and consider the b. discussion defendant contends that we should consider his appeal as a writ of prohibition under section 999a. section 999a focuses on lack of probable cause for an information: prohibition, predicated upon the ground . . . that the defendant had been committed on an information without reasonable or probable cause . . . must be filed in the appellate court within 15 days after a motion made under section 995 . . . that the defendant had been committed on an information without writ review under section 999a is not available here, because defendant never moved to set aside the information under section 995. section 995 applies in two situations that are not applicable here. first, a defendant may move to set aside an indictmethe defendant has been indicted without reasonable or probable cause. second, a defendant may move to set aside the defendant had been committed without reasonable or probable cause ( 995, subd. (a)(2)(b).) here, defendant filed his request to reduce the charge before the preliminary hearing, and before the information had been filed. defendant then sought to introduce evidence about the value of the car at the preliminary hearing. he filed his notice of appeal on july 20, 2016, before the 8 information was filed on august 1, 2016. defendant did not move under section 995 to set aside the information in the trial court. failure to challenge the information under section 995 is fatal to defendant 995 gives the defendant the opportunity to challenge the regularity of the grand jury proceedings or the preliminary examination, as well as the existence of probable cause, by motion prior to entering his plea. penal code section 996 section 995. numerous decisions of the courts have consistently held that failure to make a timely motion under section 995 (people v. padfield (1982) 136 cal.app.3d 218, 226; see also  996 made, the defendant is precluded from afterwards taking the people v. sering (1991) 232 section 995 are waived by failure to timely interpose the motion moreover, defendant pled no contest to the charges in the information. a no contest plea admits every element of the crime. (people v. french (2008) 43 cal.4th 36, 49; people v. hoffard (1995) 10 cal.4th 1170, 1177.) secution possesses legally admissible (people v. egbert (1997) 59 cal.app.4th 503, 509.) once the elements of a crime have been established at trial or through a no contest plea, a defendant cannot demonstrate prejudice from a purported lack of probable cause for the 9 information. (see people v. shaw (1986) 182 cal.app.3d 682, 684.) where a defendant fails to challenge a pretrial ruling by a eafter the defendant is convicted of the (people v. cabrera (2007) 152 cal.app.4th 695, 701.) t not appealable, and writ review is inappropriate because defendant has not preserved the issue for review. we therefore dismiss the appeal. (see people v. turrin (2009) 176 cal.app.4th 1200, 1208; people v. chlad (1992) 6 cal.app.4th 1719, 1726-1727; people v. mendez (2012) 209 cal.app.4th 32, 34.) even if we were to consider the substance of defendantarguments on the merits, his claims would fail because he has not shown that he was entitled to a reduction under proposition 47. defendant contends that proposition 47 applies to section 10851(a), but notes that this issue is unsettled in california and is currently pending before the supreme court. (see people v. page, case no. s230793; see also people v. sauceda (2016) 3 cal.app.5th 635, 639 [review granted nov. 30, 2016, s237975, holding that proposition 47 does not apply to section 10851(a)]; people v. van orden (2017) 9 cal.app.5th 1277 [review granted june 14, 2017, s241574, holding that proposition 47 does apply to section 10851(a)].) proposition 47 added section 490.2 to the penal code. (people v. rivera (2015) 233 cal.app.4th 1085, 1091.) section notwithstanding section 487 or any other provision of law defining grand theft, obtaining any property by theft where the value of the money, labor, real or personal property taken does not exceed nine hundred fifty dollars ($950) 10 shall be considered petty theft and shall be punished as a misdemeanor defendant argues that a violation of section at issue had a value of $950 or less, it necessarily falls under the definition of misdemeanor petty theft in section 490.2. a violation of section 10581(a), however, is not necessarily a theft offense. taking a vehicle with the intent to steal it or by driving it with the intent only to temporarily deprive its owner of possession [citations (people v. garza (2005) 35 cal.4th 866, 876 (garza).) a section 10851(a) conviction may also be (ibid.) steals a vehicle and then continues to drive it after the theft is complete commits separate and distinct violations of section (id. at p. 880.) the supreme court in garza discussed other cases holding that theft may become posttheft when the taker reaches a place of temporary safety (ibid.) the court he precise demarcation point may be . . . once a person who has stolen a car has passed that point, further driving of the vehicle is a separate violation of section 10851(a) (id. at p. 880-881.) here, the car at issue was reported stolen on may 31, 2016. defendant was found driving the car a week later, on june 6, 2016. even assuming section 490.2 applies to theft offenses under section 10851(a), and assuming the value of the car was 11 $950 or less,3 defendant has not established that he committed a theft offense. the time that elapsed between the theft and the date defendant was found driving the vehicle suggests that defendant was not in the process of the theft when he was stopped. instead, the evidence suggests that defendant may have been engaged in posttheft driving, a separate violation of section 10851(a). thus even if we were to assume that the order was appealable and that the value of the vehicle was $950 or less, based on the facts in the record, defendant has not demonstrated that the trial court erred by denying the motion to reduce the charge to a misdemeanor, nor has he demonstrated that he was (people v. sivongxxay (2017) 3 reversal of the judgment based on a violation of a state statute, a defendant must demonstrate that it defendant] would have been reached in the absence of the people v. watson (1956) 46 cal.2d 818, 836 [299 p.2d 243].) 3 time of his arrest, but did not present evidence that the car was worth $950 or less at the time it was stolen. statements in the probation report suggest several computers had been in the car when it was stolen, and much of the damage to the car occurred after the theft. neither party addressed how these issues may have affected the value of the property stolen. 12 disposition the appeal is dismissed without prejudice to any future motion defendant may bring pursuant to proposition 47. not to be published in the official reports collins, j. we concur: epstein, p. j. manella, j.
