(b)) for his 2011 robbery conviction.2 imposed a six-year prison term (five years for the robbery and one year for the prior prison term), but suspended execution of that sentence and placed defendant on three years of probation. the laws, orders of the court, all rules, regulations and instructions of 1 all further statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise indicated. 2 defendant was also charged with grand theft person ( 487, subd. (c)), and the people further alleged that he personally used a dangerous or deadly weapon in conjunction with the second degree robbery ( 12022, subd. (b)(1)); that his 2011 robbery aw ( 667, subds. (b)-(j) & 1170.12, subds. (a)-(d)) as well as a prior serious felony ( 667, subd. (a)(1)); and that he had two other prior prison terms ( 667.5, subd. (b)). these additional charges and 3 on march 24, 2016, defendant was admitted to the harbor area substance abuse treatment center (the center), a co-ed residential program, as part of his probation. in the first three weeks he was at the centerto answer his cell phone, and had a single physical altercation with a female patient. he had been advised in advance of the center and had been counseled about each violation but the last. the center immediately discharged him after the last f [his] the people charged defendant with violating the terms of his probation, and the trial court held an evidentiary hearing. at the conclusion of the hearing, the court found that defendant was in violation of his probation. in deciding whether to revoke or erything his ow the court nevertheless gave defense rigorous mental located one possible program in acton, california, but that program would not accept defendant because the program was not near a medical facility and thus not safe for defendant, who [it] cand watched revoked probation and imposed the previously suspended six-year prison term. defendant filed this timely appeal. 4 discussion defendant argues that the trial court erred in revoking, decision to revoke is (1) arbitrary, because it is inconsistent with its prior desire to reinstate probation and to place defendant in another mental health facility, and (2) unlawful, because it rests (namely, the absence of a nearby hospital). once a trial court finds a criminal defendant in violation of people v. jones (1990) 224 cal.app.3d 1309, 1315; people v. downey (2000) 82 cal.app.4th 899, 909;  1203.2, subds. (a) & (b)(1).) we review a trial decision to revoke rather than reinstate probation for an abuse of discretion. (people v. butcher (2016) 247 cal.app.4th 310, 318; people v. noyan (2014) 232 cal.app.4th 657, 663.) a court abuses nds of reason, all downey, at pp. 909-910, quoting people v. giminez (1975) 14 cal.3d 68, 72.) the trial court did not abuse its discretion in revoking not internally inconsistent. the court explained how defendant had been givenand had not taken advantage of[] that justified the revocation of probation, but that the court was willing to give defendant one further, final chance at reinstatement of probation contingent upon his placement in a mental health program if one could be found for him. one was not found. on thesdecision to revoke probation is neither inconsistent nor arbitrary. 5 counsel to try to find a program amounts to a finding that defendant does not pose a risk to public safety if released (accord, people v. monette (1994) 25 cal.app.4th 1572, 1575 [courts deciding whether to reinstate or revoke probation should examine be safely allowed to remain in societybeing inconsistent. there is no inconsistency because the trial court ruling could, at best, be construed as a finding that defendant did not pose a risk to public safety if placed in a suitable residential program; such a finding does not logically preclude sending defendant to prison if no such program is available. unlawful. to be sure, a court may not revoke probation unless the underlying violation involves willful conduct by the defendant. (people v. cervantes (2009) 175 cal.app.4th 291, 295; see also people v. galvan (2007) 155 cal.app.4th 978, 984 [defendant failed to report to his probation officer because he was deported; failure not willful]; in re robert m. (1985) 163 cal.app.3d 812, 816-817 [defendant failed to maintain low iq and below-grade level reading and math skills].) however, this maxim is irrelevant here. the underlying violation in this casethat is, the amalgamation of incidents at the center involving inappropriate sexual conduct, use of his cell phone, and a physical altercationwas willful. the fact that the mental health program in acton was not available due to his health condition does not cast any doubt 6 disposition the order is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. ______________________, j. hoffstadt we concur: _________________________, acting p. j. ashmann-gerst _________________________, j.* goodman * retired judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
