a rape kit was prepared; and the kit was transported to, and booked into evidence at, a police station. the rape kit was destroyed by the police in 1998. immediately before the preliminary hearing in may 2001 the court heard and nted counsel, who had argued the charges were barred by the statute of limitations and davis had been denied his right to a speedy trial. during the ensuing plea discussions, davis moved to replace his appointed counsel. that motion was denied. davis then stated he wanted to represent himself. he completed and signed the advisement and waiver-of-right-to-counsel form, and the court granted his request. the preliminary hearing was continued after davis complained of chest pains and was removed from the courtroom. when the preliminary hearing resumed, the trial court denied a request from the himself. he was held to answer on both counts and was arraigned shortly thereafter on the information charging him with rape and attempted sexual penetration by a foreign object. represented by appointed counsel at this point, davis pleaded not guilty to both charges. 1 portions of our factual description are based on material provided by davis in a motion to augment the record on appeal. that motion is granted. 3 on august 23, 2001 davis, now represented by retained counsel, moved to dismiss the charges based in part on the destruction of exculpatory evidence (the rape kit). the record does not disclose whether that motion was ever heard. two weeks later, still represented by retained counsel, davis agreed to plead no contest to an amended count of sexual battery pursuant to a negotiated agreement. davis was sentenced according to that agreement; no appeal was filed. filed in propria perrape kit had been destroyed did not constitute suppression of material exculpatory evidence under brady v. maryland (1963) 373 u.s. 83, 87 [83 s.ct. 1194, 10 l.ed.2d 215]; there was no reflected in the plea hearing transcript. on may 4, 2010 davis, represented by appointed counsel, filed a motion to vacate the judgment/dismiss the case/writ of coram nobis, which asserted, (1) before davis entered a plea, a psychiatrist should have been appointed had prevented him from knowingly and voluntarily waiving his constitutional rights to trial and understanding the nature and consequences of his plea; (3) the unjust delay in filing charges had violated he people of exculpatory evidence under brady; (5) the trial court had to counsel when it denied at the preliminary hearing; (6) the trial court had ght to self-representation when it denied his motion to continue the preliminary hearing (prior to experiencing chest pains); and (7) the felony complaint was filed after the expiration of the statute of limitations. the motion was argued and denied in july 2010. on june 26, 2013 davis, once again representing himself, filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus/coram nobis, which the trial court summarily denied. the court found, 4 in part, davis was no longer in actual or constructive state custody and his claims had been previously considered and rejected in july 2010. still representing himself, davis filed duplicate documents on october 25 and november 8, 2013, entitled otion to vacate judgment based on fraud and perjury by government officials under pc  1473.6. the trial court denied the motion on had been raised and rejected in prior proceedings. discussion we appointed counsel to represent davis on appeal.2 after examination of the record counsel filed an opening brief in which no issues were raised. on june 30, 2014 we advised davis he had 30 days within which to personally submit any contentions or issues he wished us to consider. after granting davis extensions of time, on september 9, 2014 we received a typed 39-page supplemental brief in which davis argued the trial court should have granted his section 1473.6 motion based on newly discovered evidence of fraud or misconduct by government officials (judges and prosecutors) in this case. specifically, davis alleged: (1) prosecutors filed the felony complaint after the expiration of the statute of limitations; (2) prosecutors initiated criminal proceedings against davis in 2001 although they were aware there was no probable cause because the rape kit had been destroyed in 1998; (3) falsely show the felony complaint was filed on may 25, 1999, rather than on the true date of may 29, 2001; and (4) the judge presiding over the preliminary hearing violated his choice after denying his motion to relieve his appointed attorney and compelling him to represent himself. 2 the denial of a motion to vacate a judgment under section 1473.6 is an appealable order. (people v. germany (2005) 133 cal.app.4th 784, 787, fn. 2; see people v. totari (2002) 28 cal.4th 876, 886-887.) 5 llate attorney has fully complied with the responsibilities of counsel and no arguable issue exists.
