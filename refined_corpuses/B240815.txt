[] (b) any principal in 3 section 12022.53, subdivision (e)(2), sa criminal street gang pursuant to chapter 11 (commencing with section 186.20) of title 7 of part 1 shall not be imposed on a person in addition to an enhancement imposed pursuant to this subdivision, unless the person personally used or personally discharged a 3 specified offense for the benefit of a criminal street gang is subject to both the punishment provided in section 186.22 and the increased punishment provided in section 12022.53, but, when only another principal in the offense has used or discharged the firearm, the non-criminal street gang . . 12022.53. (see people v. brookfield (2009) 47 cal.4th 583, 591 [only those offenders who personally used or discharged a firearm in committing a gang-related offense specified in  12022.53 are subject to both the enhancement provisions of that section and the gang-related sentence increases of  186.22].) here, the jury convicted garcia of the attempted willful, deliberate and premeditated murder of german preciado llamas and armando llamas ( 187, subd. (a), 664, subd. (a))an offense included within those enumerated in section 12022.53, subdivision (a). (see  12022.53, subd. (a)(17), (18).) the jury also found true as to both counts the allegations the offenses were committed for the benefit of, at the direction of or in association with a criminal street gang, with the specific intent to promote, further, or assist in criminal conduct by gang members, within the meaning of section 186.22, subdivision (b), and further found true as to both counts the allegations a principal had personally used and discharged a firearm causing great bodily injury within the meaning of section 12022.53, subdivisions (b), (c) and (d). the jury was not asked to find, and there was, therefore, no finding, that garcia himself had personally used and discharged the firearm during the attempted murders. garcia was sentenced to concurrent 35-years-to-life terms on the two counts: life with the possibility of parole for attempted willful, deliberate and premeditated murder, plus 25-years-to-life for the firearm enhancement pursuant to section 120222.53, subdivision (d), plus 10 years for the criminal street gang enhancement pursuant to section 186.22, subdivision (b)(1)(c).4 although the 25-years-to-life firearm-use 4 premeditated murder is punishable by imprisonment in the state prison for life, when that 4 12022.53, subdivision (e)(1), pursuant to section 12022.53, subdivision (e)(2), and people v. brookfield, supra, 47 cal.4th 583, it was error for the trial court to additionally impose any criminal street gang enhancement without a finding garcia had personally discharged the firearm in committing the offenses. accordingly, we strike that enhancement from the sentence on each count. disposition the judgment is modified to strike the consecutive 10-year enhancement imposed on counts 1 and 2 pursuant to section 186.22, subdivision (b)(1)(c). in all other respects the judgment is affirmed. the superior court is directed to prepare a corrected abstract of judgment and to forward it to the department of corrections and rehabilitation. perluss, p. j. we concur: woods, j. zelon, j. crime has been committed for the benefit of a criminal street gang, the minimum 15-year parole eligibility period specified in section 186.22, subdivision (b)(5), would be the proper criminal street gang enhancement, not the 10-year term for violent felonies in subdivision (b)(1)(c).
