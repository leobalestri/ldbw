(a)) and conspiracy to murder his stepfather pedro castillo ( 182, subd. (a)(1)).2 the jury found true special-circumstance allegations that the murder was committed in the course of a robbery and while lying in wait ( 190.2, subds. (15), (17)(a)), but deadlocked with respect to another special circumstance alleged in connection with the murder, namely, that it was intentional and involved torture ( 190.2, subd. (18)). a mistrial was declared with respect to the torture special-circumstance allegation, which was dismissed. 1 all further statutory references are to the penal code. 2 samuel ramirez, who was also charged with those crimes, was tried with appellant and found guilty by a separate jury. 3 the trial court imposed an lwop term on the murder conviction ( 190.2, subd. (a)), and imposed and stayed a term of 25 years to life on the conviction for conspiracy to commit murder ( 654). in an unpublished opinion (people v. padilla (june 1, 2001, b135651)), this court determined there was insufficient evidence to support the lying-in-wait special-circumstance finding, but otherwise affirmed b. section 1170(d)(2) in december 2010, senate bill no. 9 (2011-2012 reg. sess.) was introduced in the legislature to authorize the resentencing of defendants sentenced as juveniles to an lwop term. as enacted in september 2012, the bill amended section 1170 by adding subdivision (d)(2), which creates a postconviction resentencing proceeding for certain defendants serving lwop terms. section 1170(d)(2) states in clause (i) of subparagraph (a) that defendants serving an lwop term for an offense they committed when under 18 years of age may submit a petition for recall and resentencing after having served 15 years of their sentence. clause (ii) of subparagraph (a) provides a defendant is ineligible for recall and resentencing when the offense for which the lwop term was imposed was one in which as described in [s]ection 206, his or her victim,or the victim was a specified public officer or official.3 the petition must contain enumerated statements, including a description of 3 section 206 provides: every person who, with the intent to cause cruel or extreme pain and suffering for the purpose of revenge, extortion, persuasion, or for any sadistic purpose, inflicts great bodily injury as defined in section 12022.7 upon the person of another, is guilty of torture. 4 (d)(2)(b).)4 if the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the statements in the petition are true, the court shall hold a hearing to consider whether to recall the sentence and commitment previously ordered and to resentence the defendant in the same manner as if the defendant had not previously been sentenced, provided that the new sentence, if any, is not greater than the initial sentence 1170, subd. (d)(2)(e).) at the hearing, the court is authorized to resentence the defendant upon a consideration of factors relating to the defendabefore the offense, the nature of the offense, and his or her conduct after it. ( 1170, subd. (d)(2)(f).)5 4 subdivision (d)(2)(b) of petition shall include the defendants statement that he or she was under 18 years of age at the time of the crime and was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole, the defendants statement describing his or her remorse and work towards rehabilitation, and the defendants statement that one of the following is true: [] (i) the defendant was convicted pursuant to felony murder or aiding and abetting murder provisions of law. [] (ii) the defendant does not have juvenile felony adjudications for assault or other felony crimes with a significant potential for personal harm to victims prior to the offense for which the sentence is being considered for recall. [] (iii) the defendant committed the offense with at least one adult codefendant. [] (iv) the defendant has performed acts that tend to indicate rehabilitation or the potential for rehabilitation, including, but not limited to, availing himself or herself of rehabilitative, educational, or vocational programs, if those programs have been available at his or her classification level and facility, using self-study for self-improvement, or showing evidence of remorse. 5 subdivision (d)(2)(f) of section 1170 court may consider when determining whether to recall and resentence include, but are not limited to, the following: [] (i) the defendant was convicted pursuant to felony murder or aiding and abetting murder provisions of law. [] (ii) the defendant does not have juvenile felony adjudications for assault or other felony crimes with a significant potential for personal harm to victims prior to the offense (fn. continued on next page.) 5 submit a second petition after having served 20 years of his or her sentence. ( 1170, subd. (d)(2)(h).) if that petition is unsuccessful, the defendant may submit a third and final petition after having served 24 years of the sentence. (ibid.) c. underlying petition on august 1, 2013, appellant filed a petition for recall and resentencing under section 1170(d)(2). in november 2013, the trial court found that the statements in the petition were true, and set a hearing to determine whether to e hearing, the prosecution filed an opposition to the petition and a request for relief from the resentencing because his offense involved torture. after granting the request for for which the sentence is being considered for recall. [] (iii) the defendant committed the offense with at least one adult codefendant. [] (iv) prior to the offense for which the sentence is being considered for recall, the defendant had insufficient adult support or supervision and had suffered from psychological or physical trauma, or significant stress. [] (v) the defendant suffers from cognitive limitations due to mental illness, developmental disabilities, or other factors that did not constitute a defense, but influenced the defendants involvement in the offense. [] (vi) the defendant has performed acts that tend to indicate rehabilitation or the potential for rehabilitation, including, but not limited to, availing himself or herself of rehabilitative, educational, or vocational programs, if those programs have been available at his or her classification level and facility, using self-study for self-improvement, or showing evidence of remorse. [] (vii) the defendant has maintained family ties or connections with others through letter writing, calls, or visits, or has eliminated contact with individuals outside of prison who are currently involved with crime. [] (viii) the defendant has had no disciplinary actions for violent activities in the last five years in which the defendant was determined to be the aggressor. 6 relief from the findings, the court found by a preponderance of the evidence that ruled that he was ineligible for resentencing under section 1170(d)(2). this appeal followed.6 discussion appellant challenges the on several grounds. he maintains that the trial court misapplied section 1170(d)(2), contending that the criteria set forth in clause (a)(ii) of the statute rendering a defendant ineligible for relief must be established at trial. he further maintains that even if section determine whether an offense involved torture, the trial court was not authorized to make an independent finding regarding a disputed fact on the preponderance of the evidence. in the alternative, appellant contends the trial court erred in finding that his offense involved torture, as defined in section 206. as explained below, we conclude the trial court was authorized to examine the record of conviction in order to make an independent determination regarding appellant is unnecessary to address remaining contentions regarding the procedure governing that determination, as we conclude there is insufficient evidence to support finding of torture. a. application of section 1170(d)(2) a 6 is an appealable order after judgment. (see teal v. superior court (2014) 60 cal.4th 595, 598-request for resentencing pursuant to the three strikes reform act of 2012 ( 1170.126) was appealable even though the appellate court concluded that he was not eligible for resentencing].) 7 present issues of statutory interpretation subject to review de novo. (people v. christman (2014) 229 cal.app.4th 810, 816.) in construing a statute, our task is to determine the legislatures intent and purpose for the enactment. [citation.] we look first to the plain meaning of the statutory language, giving the words their usual and ordinary meaning. [citation.] if there is no ambiguity in the statutory language, its plain meaning controls; we presume the legislature meant what it said. [citation.] . . . [citations.] we examine the statutory language in the context in which it appears, and adopt the construction that best harmonizes the statute internally and with related statutes. [citations.] in addition, we may examine the statutes legislative history. (people v. whitmer (2014) 230 cal.app.4th 906, 917 (whitmer), quoting people v. palmer (2005) 133 cal.app.4th 1141, 1149.) from decisions interpreting a similar statutory scheme. in november 2012, shortly after the legislature enacted section 1170(d)(2), the voters approved the three strikes reform act of 2012, which amended the hree strikes law, and created a postconviction proceeding for defendants serving an indeterminate life sentence imposed pursuant to the three strikes law for a crime that is not a serious or violent felony. (people v. yearwood (2013) 213 cal.app.4th 161, 168.) that proceeding, as set forth in section 1170.126, closely resembles the proceeding established by section 1170(d)(2). the three strikes resentencing statute obliges a defendant seeking relief to submit a petition containing certain statements ( 1170.126, subd. (d)), states eligibility criteria for resentencing ( 1170.126, subd. (e)), and affords the court discretion to grant the petition unless, after consideration of pertinent factors, it concludes that resentencing would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety ( 1170.126, subds. (e), (f)). although the two resentencing statutes were enacted by different legislative bodies, they present 8 similar issues of interpretation in view of their analogous provisions. 7 1. no requirement that ineligibility for resentencing be established by findings at trial resentencing under clause (a)(ii) of section 1170(d)(2) must be established on the basis of special-circumstance s trial. clause his paragraph shall not apply to defendants sentenced to life without parole for an offense where the defendant was tortured, as described in [s]ection 206, his or her victim or the victim was a public safety official, including any law enforcement personnel mentioned in chapter 4.5 (commencing with [s]ection 830) of title 3, or any firefighter as described in [s]ection 245.1, as well as any other officer in any segment of law enforcement who is employed by the federal government, the state, or any of its political subdivision imposition of lwop terms. section 189 establishes several types of first degree murder, including premeditated murder, murder by torture or involving other circumstances deemed equivalent to premeditation, and felony murders (murders perpetrated during specified felonies and attempted felonies.) (people v. rodriguez (1998) 66 cal.app.4th 157, 163.) section 190.2 enumerates more than 20 that expose a defendant guilty of first degree murder to 7 the of the legislature to enact statutes (santa clara county local transportation authority v. guardino (1995) 11 cal.4th 220, 253), and their legislative acts are subject to the same principles of statutory interpretation (people v. briceno (2004) 34 cal.4th 451, 459). 9 an lwop term or the death penalty, provided at least one is alleged and found true at trial in connection with the murder. (ibid;  190.4.) pertinent here is subdivision (a)(18) he murder was intentional and involved the infliction of torture. under that provision, the intent required for the infliction of torture is identical to the intent required for the the intent to cause cruel or extreme pain and suffering for the purpose of revenge, extortion, persuasion, or for any sadistic purpose . . . . (people v. elliot (2005) 37 cal.4th 453, 477-479.) also pertinent are subdivisions (a)(7) through (a)(9) of that statute, which apply when the victim was a peace officer or firefighter intentionally killed while the defendant knew, or should have known, he or she was performing official duties, or (in the case of certain officers) in retaliation for the prior performance of those duties. 8 8 was a peace officer, as defined in section 830.1, 830.2, 830.3, 830.31, 830.32, 830.33, 830.34, 830.35, 830.36, 830.37, 830.4, 830.5, 830.6, 830.10, 830.11, or 830.12, who, while engaged in the course of the performance of his or her duties, was intentionally killed, and the defendant knew, or reasonably should have known, that the victim was a peace officer engaged in the performance of his or her duties; or the victim was a peace officer, as defined in the above-enumerated sections, or a former peace officer under any of those sections, and was intentionally killed in retaliation for the performance of his or her official duties. [] (8) the victim was a federal law enforcement officer or agent who, while engaged in the course of the performance of his or her duties, was intentionally killed, and the defendant knew, or reasonably should have known, that the victim was a federal law enforcement officer or agent engaged in the performance of his or her duties; or the victim was a federal law enforcement officer or agent, and was intentionally killed in retaliation for the performance of his or her official duties. [] (9) the victim was a firefighter, as defined in section 245.1, who, while engaged in the course of the performance of his or her duties, was intentionally killed, and the defendant knew, or reasonably should have known, that the victim was a firefighter engaged in the performance of his or her duties. 10 under subdivision (b) of section 190.5, the trial court has the discretion to impose an lwop term on a defendant guilty of first degree murder who was 16 years or older at the time of the offense, provided at least one special circumstance was found to be true.9 appellant contends that ineligibility for resentencing under section 1170(d)(2) is predicated on the special circumstance findings rendered at trial, arguing that the facts specified in clause (a)(ii) of section 1170(d)(2) correspond to the special circumstance provisions in section 190.2 noted above. he thus maintains that clause (a)(ii) limits ineligibility to lineated categories of excluded tethered to those provisions. as explained below, we disagree. generally, we do not read statutes to omit expressed language or to include (tyrone w. v. superior court (2007) 151 cal.app.4th 839, 850.) [w]hen a statute on a particular subject omits a particular provision, the inclusion of such a provision in another statute concerning a related matter indicates an intent that the provision is not applicable to the statute from which it was omitted. (ibid., quoting katie v. v. superior court (2005) 130 cal.app.4th 586, 595.) in view of those principles, courts construing the three strikes resentencing statute have concluded that facts rendering a defendant ineligible for resentencing need not have been pleaded and proved at trial. those 9 subdivision (b) of section 190.5 provides: the penalty for a defendant found guilty of murder in the first degree, in any case in which one or more special circumstances enumerated in section 190.2 or 190.25 has been found to be true under section 190.4, who was 16 years of age or older and under the age of 18 years at the time of the commission of the crime, shall be confinement in the state prison for life without the possibility of parole or, at the discretion of the court, 25 years to life. 11 courts have observed that the three strikes reform act of 2012 omitted a plead-and-prove requirement from the resentencing statute but imposed such a requirement on future three strike sentences (people v. white (2014) 223 cal.app.4th 512, 526-527 (white)), and that -- as discussed below (see pt. a.2., post) -- some facts rendering a defendant ineligible for resentencing do not track offenses or special allegations pleaded against defendants (people v. bradford (2014) 227 cal.app.4th 1322, 1332 (bradford)). similar considerations are dispositive here. although section 190.2 requires special circumstance findings for the imposition of lwop terms, clause (a)(ii) of section 1170(d)(2), by its plain language, bases ineligibility for relief on specified facts. the omission of any reference to special circumstance findings in that clause suggests the legislature did not intend to predicate ineligibility on such findings. furthermore, the facts specified in clause (a)(ii) of section 1170(d)(2) do not specifically track the special circumstances described above, as the facts may exist when the special circumstances findings do not. because section 190.2 permits the imposition of an lwop term in many situations, a defendant may suffer an lwop sentence for the murder of a public officer or firefighter without satisfying the requirements of subdivisions (a)(7) through (a)(9) of section 190.2. thus -- as we elaborate below-- a defendant may suffer an lwop term for the felony murder of a police officer without satisfying the peace officer special circumstance. similarly, a defendant may suffer an lwop term for a murder involving torture, as defined in section 206, even though that offense does not satisfy the torture-related special circumstance set forth in subdivision (a)(18) of section 190.2. for example, a so-egregious intent to torture but not an intent to kill, need not satisfy the torture-related special circumstance (people v. jennings 12 (2010) 50 cal.4th 616, 647), but will ordinarily involve acts of torture, as defined in section 206 (people v. jung (1999) 71 cal.app.4th 1036, 1042, fn. 4 (jung) version of torture.).10 nonetheless, a defendant who commits two or more murders, including a murder by torture not satisfying the torture-related special circumstance, is properly subject to an lwop term for each murder pursuant to a -circumstance finding ( 190.2, subd. (a)(3)). (people v. garnica (1994) 29 cal.app.4th 1558, 1562-1564.) thus, an lwop sentence may be imposed on a defendant for a murder involving torture or the killing of a public officer or firefighter without satisfying subdivisions (a)(7) through (a)(9) of section 190.2. we find additional support for our conclusion that the eligibility criteria in clause (a)(ii) of section 1170(d)(2) are not tied to special circumstance findings from people v. gutierrez (2014) 58 cal.4th 1354 (gutierrez), which examined the trial cousubdivision (b), in light of miller v. alabama (2012) 567 u.s.__,__ [132 s.ct. 2455, 2460, 2469] (miller), which held that the eighth amendment of the united forbids a sentencing scheme that mandates life in prison without possibility of parole for juvenile offendersgutierrez involved consolidated appeals by two defendants sentenced to lwop terms for murders 10 (1) acts causing death that involve a high degree of probability of the victims death; and (2) a willful, deliberate, and premeditated intent to cause extreme pain or suffering for the purpose of revenge, extortion, persuasion, or another sadistic purpose. [citations.][citation.] the prosecution need not establish that the defendant intended to kill the victim [citation], but must prove a causal relationship between the torturous acts and the death people v. jennings, supra, 50 cal.4th at p. 643, quoting people v. cook (2006) 39 cal.4th 566, 602.) 13 they committed as juveniles. (gutierrez, supra, 58 cal.4th at p. 1361.) in one appeal, the defendant had robbed a supermarket with an accomplice, who fatally shot a police officer while the defendant fled. (id. at pp. 1361-1363.) the defendant was convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to an lwop term on the basis of felony-murder and peace officer special-circumstance findings ( 190.2, subds. (a)(7), (a)(17)), but a court of appeal later reversed the peace officer finding for want of evidence that the defendant had encouraged his accomplice to shoot the officer. (gutierrez, supra, at p. 1363.) in the other appeal, the defendant was convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to an lwop term on the basis of a rape-related felony-murder special circumstance finding ( 190.2, subd. (a)(7)). (gutierrez, supra, at pp. 1366-1367.) the issue before our supreme court was whether, in light of miller, subdivision (b) of section 190.5 had properly been interpreted by appellate courts to establish a presumption favoring the imposition of lwop sentences. (gutierriez, supra, 58 cal.4th at pp. 1368-1370.) the court concluded that the statute conferred discretion on sentencing courts to impose either an lwop term or a term of 25 years to life on 16- and 17-year-old offenders convicted of special circumstance murder, with no presumption in favor of an lwop term. (id. at p. 1387.) the court further held that a sentencing court, in exercising its discretion, must consider certain factors identified in miller. (id. at pp. 1387-1390.) the court thus remanded the two cases to afford the sentencing courts an opportunity to exercise their discretion in a fully informed manner. (id. at pp. 1390-1392.) in determining that section 190.5, subdivision (b), established no presumption favoring lwop sentence, the supreme court rejected a contention that section 1170(d)(2) eliminated constitutional problems arising from such a presumption. (gutierrez, supra, 58 cal.4th at pp. 1384-1387.) the court 14 concluded that the defendant whose accomplice had fatally shot a police officer a public safety officialclause (a)(ii) of section 1170(d)(2). (gutierrez, supra, at p. 1385.) the court further concluded that the enactment of section 1170(d)(2) did not modify existing lwop sentences imposed under section 190.5, subdivision (b), which remained the resentencing procedure established by section 1170(d)(2) did not eliminate constitutional defects in the imposition of those sentences. (gutierrez, supra, at pp. 1386-1387, italics deleted.) eligibility determination regarding the defendant charged with the murder of the police officer comports with our conclusion regarding section 1170(d)((2). because the peace officer special-circumstance finding had been reversed, the court necessarily inferred that the defendant was ineligible for relief merely because the victim was a public safety official. the court thus construed ineligibility to hinge simply on the fact specified in clause (a)(ii) of section 1170(d)(2).11 11 pointing to the briefs presented to the supreme court in gutierrez, appellant contends we should reject the eligibility determination because it is a dictum. at that aftes watch, as amicus curiae, agreed with that interpretation of section 1170(d)(2). appellant maintains that because the disregarded. we disagree. the fact that a statement by the supreme court is a dictum does not mean (sargoy v. resolution trust corp. (1992) 8 cal.app.4th 1039, 1045.) a dictum of the supreme court (fn. continued on next page.) 15 appellant contends that section 1170(d)(2) establishes ineligibility determination based solely on special-circumstance findings rendered onerous and time-determination of eligibility facts by the trial court adjudicating a resentencing petition. he directs our attention to portions of the legislative history of section 1170(d)(2), namely, analyses of an early version of senate bill no. 9 (2011-2012 reg. sess.) by the senate and assembly appropriations committees.12 the analyses state that resentencing hearings were likely to consume no more than three hours and cost approximately $2,000, and that the resentencing proceeding would provide some defendants with a means of challenging their sentences less costly than a petition for writ of habeas corpus. (sen. appropriations com., fiscal impact of sen. bill no. 9 (2011-2012 reg. sess.), may 26, 2011, p. 2; assem. appropriations com., arries persuasive weight and should be followed where it demonstrates a thorough analysis of the issue or reflects compelling logic. (smith v. county of los angeles (1989) 214 cal.app.3d 266, 297.) in contrast, we need not follow a dictum that is firemans fund ins. co. v. maryland casualty co. (1998) 65 cal.app.4th 1279, 1301-considered jaramillo v. state of california (1978) 81 cal.app.3d 968, 971). is properly regarded as support for our interpretation of section 1170(d)(2). the determination occurs within a considered discussion of section 1170(d)(2), and the rationale underlying it -- namely, that clause (a)(ii) of section 1170(d)(2), by its plain language, rendered the defendant ineligible for relief -- was sufficiently compelling to have been accepted by the parties, including the defendant. 12 , and on our own motion, we have taken judicial notice of the complete legislative history of section 1170(d)(2). (gananian v. wagstaffe (2011) 199 cal.app.4th 1532, 1542, fn. 9; people v. superior court (ferguson) (2005) 132 cal.app.4th 1525, 1532-1533; evid. code,  452, subd. (c), 459.) 16 analysis of sen. bill no. 9 (2011-2012 reg. sess.), august 17, 2011, p. 2.) the legislative analyses on which he relies address early versions of senate bill no. 9 that lacked the provision codified as clause (a)(ii) of section 1170(d)(2). senate bill no. 9 was amended to include that provision in september 2011, after the analyses, which were prepared in may and august 2011. (sen. bill no. 9 (2011-2012 reg. sess.), as amended sept. 2, 2011.) prior to that amendment, the bill contained no eligibility criteria analogous to those found in clause (a)(ii) of section 1170(d)(2). for that reason, the analyses do not support the inference that the legislature intended to establish an eligibility determination based solely on special-circumstance findings. in a related contention, appellant suggests that section 1170(d)(2) should be interpreted facilitate challenges to lwop sentences under miller. however, as appellant acknowledges, our supreme court concluded in gutierrez that section 1170(d)(2) that does not eliminate the constitutional concerns regarding the initial imposition of lwop sentences identified in miller. gutierrez, supra, 58 cal.4th at p. 1386, italics deleted.) nor does section 1170(d)(2) manifest a legislative intent to create a procedure for challenging the constitutional soundness of an existing lwop sentence. nothing in the statute requires an inquiry into the propriety of that sentence, and the threshold requirement for relief -- namely, that defendants must serve at least 15 years of their sentences before seeking relief ( 1170, subd. (d)(2)(a)(ii) -- is inconsistent with an intent to enable challenges to the existing sentence. furthermore, the legislative history of the statute discloses that no material amendments to senate bill no. 9 after miller, which was decided in june 2012, approximately two months before the bill was enacted. although nothing in section 1170(d)(2) itself forecloses a defendant from attempting to assert a claim 17 under miller, it cannot reasonably be regarded as designed to facilitate such claims.13 rather, people v. superior court (kaulick) (2013) 215 cal.app.4th 1279, 1304 (kaulick) [discussing the three strikes sentencing law]). the provisions of section 1170(d)(2), by their plain language, manifest an intent to establish a procedure by which eligible defendants who have served a lengthy portion of their lwop term may secure remorse and work towards rehabilitation ( 1170, subd. (d)(2)(b)), as well as other factors relating to their offense and subsequent conduct. because is clear, we decline to construe section 1170(d)(2) in a manner ignoring that intent in order to promote its use for a different purpose. (see bd. (1993) 4 cal.4th 1213, 1226 [second-in enacting statute is not appropriate task for courts].) in sum, we conclude a established on the basis of special-circumstance findings rendered at trial. 13 we do not address or decide the extent to which defendants sentenced to lwop terms for murders they committed as juveniles may properly challenge their sentence on the basis of miller. issues relating to the retrospective application of miller and the availability of relief by petition for writ of habeas corpus are currently before our supreme court in in re alatriste and bonilla (2013) 220 cal.app.4th 1232, review granted february 19, 2014, s214652 (alatriste) and s214960 (bonilla). those issues are also before the united states supreme court in state v. montgomery (2014) 141 so.3d 264, cert. granted sub nom. montgomery v. louisiana (2015) ___ u.s. ___ [135 s.ct. 1546, 191 l.ed.2d 635]. 18 2. determination of ineligibility facts appellant also asserts several contentions relating to the determination of eligibility facts under clause (a)(ii) of section 1170(d)(2), which does not expressly specify the procedure governing that determination or the appropriate standard of proof. he maintains that the court may not base eligibility determinations on facts in dispute at trial. in the alternative, he argues that determinations of disputed eligibility facts must rely on the beyond-a-reasonable-doubt or clear-and-convincing-evidence standards of proof. for the reasons discussed below, it is unnecessary for us to resolve those contentions. we conclude that when the verdicts and special findings rendered at trial do not resolve whether the defendant is eligible for relief, the trial court may independently the record of conviction here discloses insufficient evidence to support the trial s or decide whether the court was authorized to resolve an issue in dispute at trial or as appellant acknowledges, the case authority interpreting the three strikes resentencing statute ( 1170.126) provides guidance regarding his contentions. under that statute, a defendant sentenced as a three strike offender may petition for recall of the sentence and for resentence, but is subject to eligibility criteria for which the statute sets forth no determination procedure or standard of proof. ( 1170.126, subd. (e).) numerous decisions interpreting that provision have concluded that when certain eligibility facts have not been resolved by the verdicts or special findings rendered at trial, the trial court may independently examine the record of conviction in order to make determinations regarding those facts. (people v. hicks (2014) 231 cal.app.4th 275, 286 (hicks); people v. brimmer (2014) 230 cal.app.4th 782, 799-801; bradford, supra, 227 cal.app.4th at 19 pp. 1338-1340; people v. manning (2014) 226 cal.app.4th 1133, 1139-1144; people v. osuna (2014) 225 cal.app.4th 1020; white, supra, 223 cal.app.4th at pp. 526-527.) we find guidance here from bradford, which examined an exclusion for eligibility that applies if [d]uring . . . the current offense, [that is, the offense which the resentencing petition targets] the defendant used a firearm, was armed with a firearm or deadly weapon, or intended to cause great bodily injury to another person (bradford, supra, 227 cal.app.4th at p. 1327, quoting  667, subd. (e)(2)(c)(iii), 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(c)(iii).) in bradford, evidence was wire cutters in his pocket when arrested. (bradford, supra, at pp. 1329-1330.) he offender. (id. at p. 1327.) resentencing, the trial court ruled that he was ineligible for relief, concluding that because he had a pair of wire cutters when arrested, he had been armed with a deadly weapon during the commission of the robberies. (id. at p. 1330.) the appellate court concluded that in the absence of verdicts or special trial courts are authorized to make independent factual determinations regarding the eligibility criteria stated above. (bradford, supra, 227 cal.app.4th at pp. 1331-1334, 1336-1337.) in so concluding, the court noted that the eligibility criteria did not describe (id. at p. 1332.) the court further determined that the determination of eligibility facts does not enhance sentence, and thus does not implicate his or her right under the sixth amendment of the united states constitution to have essential facts found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt, as set forth in apprendi v. new jersey (2000) 530 u.s. 466, 490 (apprendi). (bradford, supra, at 20 pp. 1334-1336.) in discussing the independent factual determinations, the bradford court concluded that the trial inquiry is kin to the task facing a sentencing court assessing whether a prior conviction may be proved as an enhancement. (bradford, supra, 227 cal.app.4th at p. 1339.) the court thus looked for guidance to a line of cases addressing that task stemming from people v. guerrero (1988) 44 cal.3d 343, 355 (guerrero), in which our supreme court held that sentencing courts may examine the record of conviction enhancement. (bradford, supra, at pp. 1338-1340.) in view of the guerrero line of cases, the court concluded that the trial court may examine the record of conviction in order to determine eligibility facts.14 (ibid.) nonetheless, noting that the resentencing statute set forth a that differed from the imposition of an enhancement, the appellate court declined to decide whether guerrero and its progeny governed standard of proof. (bradford, supra, 227 cal.app.4th at pp. 1339-1340, 1336-1337.) the court concluded that it was unnecessary to identify the standard of proof applicable to the eligibility finding in question, as the finding failed regardless of the standard of proof. because the evidence at trial disclosed only 14 convictionthe record on appeal [citation], or more narrowly, as referring only to those record documents reliably reflecting the facts of the offense for which the defendant was convicted.people v. reed (1996) 13 cal.4th 217, 223.) the record of conviction includes the transcript of the jury trial (people v. bartow (1996) 46 cal.app.4th 1573, 1579-1580) and the appellate record (if any), including the appellate opinion (people v. woodell (1998) 17 cal.4th 448, 451). 21 that the defendant had a pair of wire cutters in his pocket when arrested, but not that the wire cutters were intended for use as a weapon, the court determined that there was no evidence that the defendant was armed with a deadly weapon during the commission of the robberies. (id. at pp. 1441-1343.) in our view, bradford provides compelling guidance regarding whether the trial court, in assessing eligibility under section 1170(d)(2), may look to the record of conviction, as the eligibility provisions of section 1170(d)(2) and the three strikes resentencing statute closely resemble each other. the eligibility provisions of each statute permit independent factual determinations by the trial court, but specify no standard of proof; furthermore, eligibility determinations under them . we therefore conclude that when the eligibility facts set forth in clause (a)(ii) of section 1170(d)(2) have not been resolved by the verdicts or special findings rendered at trial, the court may independently examine the record of conviction in order to determine whether the defendant is eligible for relief. 15 relying on apprendi, appellant contends tfactual issue relevant to his eligibility -- namely, that his offense involved torture, as defined in section 206 -- contravened his rights under the sixth and fourteenth amendments of the united states constitution to trial by jury and due process.16 15 in people v. marin (2015) 240 cal.app.4th 1344, this court concluded that a key aspect of california law governing the sentencing task examined in guerrero and related decisions -- as set forth in people v. mcgee (2006) 38 cal.4th 682, 706 -- did not survive descamps v. united states (2013) 570 u.s. __ [133 s.ct. 2276] (descamps). nothing in our opinion addresses or decides any issue regarding the restrictions applicable to sentencing courts in assessing whether a prior conviction may be proved as an enhancement. 16 in addition, appellant points to descamps, supra, 570 u.s. at page ___ [133 s.ct. at page 2288] and people v. wilson (2013) 219 cal.app.4th 500, 513-516, (fn. continued on next page.) 22 he argues that section 1170(d)(2) was intended to remedy constitutional defects in some lwop terms imposed on defendants as juveniles, pointing to remarks by the author of senate bill no. 9 (2011-2012 reg. sess.), who stated that juvenile no. 9 (2011-2012 reg. sess.) april 5, 2011, p. 7 [statement of sen. yee].) we disagree. as noted above, bradford rejected a similar contention under apprendi targeting eligibility determinations pursuant to the three strikes resentencing statute (bradford, supra, 227 cal.app.4th at pp. 1334-1336). that rejection is traceable to kaulick, in which the appellate court concluded that notwithstanding apprendi, trial courts may apply the preponderance-of-the-evidence standard in determining whether resentencing a defendant would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety, for purposes of the three strikes resentencing statute (kaulick, supra, 215 cal.app.4th at pp. 1301-1305). apprendi was inapplicable, the court in kaulick explained, because the three strikes resentencconstitutionally required, but [is] an act of lenity on the part of the [legislative body] (id. at p. 1304.) because as explained above (see pt. a.1., ante), section 1170(d)(2) reflects no legislative intent to establish a procedure for challenging lwop terms as constitutionally infirm when imposed; indeed, the threshold requirement for relief -- namely, that the defendant have served at least 15 years of his or her lwop term -- is inconsistent with any such intent. the remarks by the author of senate bill no. 9 which apply apprendi to sentencing issues carrying the potential for increased punishment. 23 cannot reasonably be regarded as compelling a different conclusion, as they preceded miller, and no material change was made to the bill after that decision. (kaulick, supra, 215 cal.app.4th at p. 1304.) in sum, under clause (a)(ii) of section 1170(d)(2), when the verdicts and special findings rendered at trial do not resolve whether the defendant is eligible for relief, the trial court may independently examine the record of conviction in order to determine those facts.17 b. torture determination appellant contends the trial court, in finding him ineligible for relief, erred in determining that the murder he committed involved torture. the jury failed to find that the murder involved torture, but the trial court, following an independent involved torture, as defined in section 206. the crux of argument is that the portions of the record of conviction considered by the court do not support that determination. as explained below, we agree. 1. standard of review at the outset, we observe that the parties disagree regarding the applicable 17 in a related contention, appellant argues that denied his federal and state rights to due process because it arbitrarily denied him an entitlement provided by state law (hicks v. oklahoma (1980) 447 u.s. 343, 346; estelle v. mcguire (1991) 502 u.s. 62, 72-73; in re head (1983) 147 cal.app.3d 1125, 1132). we reject his contention, as appellant has not shown the trial court contravened state law by examining the record of conviction. (see people v. prince (2007) 40 cal.4th 1179, 1273.) 24 constituted a conclusion of law that we must resolve de novo; in contrast, respondent asserts that it is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. however, the analogous determinations under the three strikes resentencing statute are not discretionary rulings, but constitute factual findings reviewed for the existence of substantial evidence. (hicks, supra, 231 cal.app.4th at pp. 280-281; see bradford, supra, 227 cal.app.4th at pp. 1341-1343.) 18 we therefore apply that standard of review. in applying the substantial evidence test, we do not address or decide the 18 in contending that the appellant directs our attention to people v. oehmigen (2014) 232 cal.app.4th 1, 3-4 (oehmigen), which examined whether defendants seeking relief under the three strikes resentencing statute are entitled to an evidentiary hearing on their eligibility. there, the defendant was sentenced as a three strike offender after pleading guilty to assault with force likely to cause great bodily injury. in entering the plea, the defendant stated that he had directed his speeding car at a pursuing police vehicle, thus requiring its occupants to make an evasive maneuver, and that after he crashed his car, officers found in it a gun and pipe bombs. (id. at p. 5.) when the defendant sought resentencing, the trial court concluded that the limited record of judgment established his ineligibility, as it showed that his conviction involved both being armed with deadly weapons and an intent to inflict great bodily injury. (ibid.) on appeal, the defendant contended that he was entitled to an evidentiary hearing on his eligibility, pointing to the requirement for an evidentiary hearing on a petition for habeas corpus upon a prima facie showing of relief based on a contested issue of fact. (id. at p. 6.) the appellate court concluded that the three strikes resentencing statute imposes no requirement for an evidentiary hearing on eligibility. (id. at pp. 6-7.) in ranalogy to habeas corpus proceedings, the court stated that eligibility is a question of law, the resolution of disputed issuesid. at p. 7, italics deleted.) in our view, oehmigen is not persuasive regarding the oehmigen buttresses its assertion that eligibility is a question of law solely by a citation to bradford (oehmigen, supra, 232 cal.app.4th at p. 7), which characterizes the eligibility determination as factual (bradford, supra, 227 cal.app.4th at pp. 1334, 1343). 25 applicable standard of proof or whether the trial court was authorized to resolve an issue in dispute at trial. for the reasons discussed below (see pt. b.3., post), we conclude that the situation before us closely resembles that presented in bradford: the record discloses no evidence sufficient to support the tdetermination. 2. torture bodily injury upon the person of another, and (2) the person inflicting the injury did so with specific intent to cause cruel and extreme pain and suffering for the people v. baker (2002) 98 cal.app.4th 1217, 1223.) focuses on the mental state of the perpetrator and not the actual pain inflictedpeople v. hale (1999) 75 cal.app.4th 94, 108 (hale)disfiguring injuries (people v. pre (2004) 117 cal.app.4th 413, 420 (pre)), as ]brasions, lacerations and bruising can constitute great bodily injury, for purposes of section 206 (jung, supra, 71 cal.app.4th at p. 1042). although the intent required for torture is less egregious in certain respects than the intent required for murder by torture, their similarities render their determination subject to the same principles. (pre, supra, 117 cal.app.4th at pp. 420-421.)19 intent is rarely susceptible of direct proof and usually must be 19 as explained in pre, [t]he intent required for a conviction of the offense contained in section 206 differs from the intent required for murder by torture since the torture offense in section 206 does not require that the defendant act with premeditation or deliberation or that the defendant have an intent to inflict prolonged pre, supra, 117 cal.app.4th at p. 420, italics deleted; see also people v. aguilar (1997) 58 cal.app.4th 1196, 1201-1206 [discussing elements of (fn. continued on next page.) 26 inferred from the facts and circumstances surrounding the offense.

(people v. barrera (1993) 14 cal.app.4th 1555, 1564.) id. at p. 1564.) nor is the intent to torture necessarily established when the killing was intentional, savage, and involved repeated attacks, and the defendant sought financial gain. in people v. mungia (2008) 44 cal.4th 1101, 1106-1107 (mungia), the defendant took some of her valuables. when discovered, her hands were bound. (ibid.) the coroner testified that she had suffered 23 blows to the head, four of which were significant, and had died of craniocerebral injuries. (mungia, supra, 44 cal.4th at p. 1110.) the coroner described the injuries as some of the most brutal that he had ever (ibid.) in addition, the victim displayed defensive wounds, and the evidence at trial suggested that she had been bound before she began to bleed. (id. at pp. 1106-1109.) our supreme court reversed a torture-murder special circumstance finding 30 ( 190.2, subd. (a)(18)), concluding there was insufficient evidence of the intent to torture, as specified in section 206, even though the record established that the defendant , and that he battered her to death. in so concluding, the court stated that severe injuries may be consistent s crime suggested that he had killed in order to conceal his identity. (mungia, at pp. 1136-1139.) the court also them id. at p. 1138.) we conclude that there is insufficient evidence of the requisite intent to torture. although appellant and ramirez ekill gina and take some money, nothing reasonably suggests that appellant intended to inflict unnecessary or additional pain on gina in order to acquire that money. here, as in mungia, by itself, does not demonstrate a sadistic intent. nor is there evidence that appellant intended to inflict pain as revenge. as (whitmer, supra, 230 cal.app.4th at p. 917.) commonly understood, revenge involves an act of retaliation. (merriam-websters collegiate dict. (10th ed. 1995) p. 1002, col. 2 [an act or instance of retaliating ]; law dict. (10th ed. 2014) p. actual wrongdoer; the infliction of punishment for th) although appellant told investigating officers that he hated his parents because they were too strict with him, his remarks disclose that his goal was to remedy his this case is thus distinguishable from those relied upon by respondent, in which the defendant made remarks demonstrating his violent conduct was an act of retaliation. (people v. 31 chavez (1958) 50 cal.2d 778, 783-sapeople]; people v. burton (2006) 143 cal.app.4th 447, 453 [before punching would make sure no one would ever want to look at her]; hale, supra, 75 cal.app.4th at pages 98-going to bust [her] fucking head with a hammerl peen hammer].) in contrast, appellant made no remarks suggesting an intent to retaliate against his parents. nor does the evidence show that appellant killed gina in a manner calculated to give him sadistic pleasure. by t circumstances of the killing does not support the reasonable inference that appellant inflicted multiple wounds for his own enjoyment. that evidence unequivocally shows that gina struggled against her assailants, and her body displayed defensive injuries. all the serious stab wounds and most of the wounds were located on her head, neck, chest, and abdomen, which an attacker intending to kill would ordinarily try to strike. dr. ortiz testified that it was impossible to determine the order in which the wounds were inflicted. furthermore, as appellant and ramirez intended to escape responsibility for the killing, it is unsurprising that appellant tried to muffle gina. on this record, it cannot reasonably be inferred that appellant killed gina in a manner intended to enhance sadistic pleasure, rather than to ensure her death. his conduct, namely, that when he went to the bathroom to wash his hands, he heard his mother calling his name, returned to her, and put a wash cloth in her mouth. a 32 establish when his visit to the bathroom occurred.23 however, even if that visit preceded the muffling, nothing supports the reasonable inference that appellant tried to silence her to enhance his pleasure, rather than to facilitate the killing and a successful getaway. the decisions to which respondent points to establish a sadistic intent involved attacks manifesting cruel conduct calculated to create sadistic pleasure. (people v. davenport (1985) 41 cal.3d 247, 258 [dead victim was found nude with a long wooden stake forced deep into her rectum]; people v. whisenhunt (2008) 44 cal.4th 174, 201 [evidence showed that after defendant incapacitated victim, he poured hot cooking oil on her and repositioned her to inflict burns throughout her body]; people v. raley (1992) 2 cal.4th 870, 883-884, 889 [defendant stabbed his two victims, confined them in a car trunk for hours, refused them medical treatment, and tossed them down a ravine, where one died]; mincey, supra, 2 cal.4th at page 428 [anus of dead five-year old victim had been sheared by a physical object]; pre, supra, 117 cal.app.4th at pages 416-417 [after choking and clubbing victim at entrance of her apartment, defendant dragged her to concealed location within apartment, where he bit her ear while choking her]; people v. healy (1993) 14 cal.app.4th 1137, 1139 [over two-week period, defendant battered cohabitant victim daily, resulting in multiple fractures throughout her body].) as explained above, analogous circumstances have not been established here. in sum, the trial cosection 206, fails for want of substantial evidence. 23 when asked during the police interview where he got the wash cloth he put the sergeant now after you put that in her mouth and you stabbed her twice in the chest and then you went and w 33 disposition the order of the court is reversed, and the matter is remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion. not to be published in the official reports manella, j. we concur: willhite, acting p. j. collins, j.
