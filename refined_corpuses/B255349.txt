(pen. code,  288.5, subd. (a).)1 defendant argues that the trial court erroneously failed to (1) give a unanimity instruction, sua sponte, and (2) grant a new trial, based on jury misconduct. we find no error and affirm. facts sandra o. described sexual conduct by defendant that began when she was five or six years old and continued until 1998, when she was 10. during that time, defendant was in a relationship with sang., and he spent nearly every night at her home. he babysat sandra when g. left before 5:00 a.m. for work. when sandra was five or six years old, and g. was at her job, defendant asked sandra to sit on his lap while they watched television. she complied, facing away from him. defendant turned her to face him, astraddle, and began kissing her neck and chest. their genitals were touching through their clothing and he placed his hands on her thighs. sandra was confused by this conduct which, to her youthful sensibilities, went on for a long time. seslept, and instructed her to lie down in the master bedroom. as sandra dozed, defendant began rubbing her leg and upper body, and told her to get on top of him. she tried to sit on his belly button and avoid his private parts, but defendant repositioned her to straddle because she was scared and he is an adult, so she had to obey. 1 unlabeled statutory references in this opinion are to the penal code. 3 with hidefendant told her to get off and return to her room. sandra described an incident that occurred when she was about nine years old. immediately obey, but looked at him, frightenedshe tried to hold onto her underpants, but he took them off. laying on the bed, with her she did not know what he meant, but , so prevent him from penetrating her. because he was not getting anywhere, defendant lay on his back and told sandra to get on top of him. as she straddled him, he began moving her back and forth by holding onto her thighs, so that his penis rubbed against her vagina. although he did not penetrate her, the force of the movement was painful. this went on for a long time, until defendant ejaculated onto his stomach. this was the only occasion when defendant engaged in skin-to-skin frottage; however, there were three or four instances of it while they were clothed, when sandra was six to eight years old. in addition, defendant had sandra touch his naked penis, guiding her with his hand to rub him while he massaged her clitoris. after defendant ejaculated, he directed her to get tissues to clean off the semen. sandra was about nine years old at the time. throughout the time that she knew him, defendant touched sandra seven to nine she did not disclose the abuse because she was scared of defendant. he told her to never tell anyone, and that her mother would not believe her because g. loved him more than she loved sandra. sandra believed him. 4 sexual misconduct to her mother in 2010, when a school teacher was accused of molesting students, including sandra. g. notified the police, who arranged for sandra to confront defendant about his behavior in recorded telephone calls. defendant . . . explain his conduct, and told her to not feel bad about it. eventually, defendant said, nd procedural history defendant was charged with continuous sexual abuse of sandra o. from 1993 to 1998, while he was residing with and had access to her. ( 288.5.) a jury found him guilty. after allowing defendant time to investigate possible juror misconduct, the court ( 1181.) he was sentenced to the low term of six years in prison. he appeals. discussion 1. no unanimity instruction was required to convict a defendant of unanimously agree only that the requisite number of acts occurred not on which acts 2 defendant argues that the statute california and federal constitutional guarantees of due process 2 the corresponding jury instruction, which was given, is calcrim no. 1120: more acts over a period of at least three months, but you do not all need to agree on 5 trial court was required to provide a standard unanimity instruction, though trial counsel did not request one. unanimity to be a requisite of due process of law. indeed, the court has more than once expressly said that [i]n criminal cases due process of law is not denied by a state law . . . which dispenses with the necessity of . . . unanimity in the verdict. (johnson v. louisiana (1972) 406 u.s. 356, 359; people v. adames (1997) 54 cal.app.4th 198, 207; people v. vargas (2001) 91 cal.app.4th 506, 562.) thus, section 288.5 does not violate due process guarantees in the federal constitution. instead, the unanimity requirement is found in the state constitution. (cal. const., art. i,  16; people v. jones (1990) 51 cal.3d 294, 321.) even so, no appellate court in this state has ever agreed with the constitutional challenge that defendant raises here. section 288.5 is designed to address the situation presented by a resident molester who has unchecked access to a child and repeatedly molests her over a prolonged periodin this case, over the course of some five years. (see people v. rodriguez (2002) 28 cal.4th 543, 549-5continuous sexual abuse of a child ( 288.5) is a continuous-course-of-conduct crime and therefore falls within the exception to the rule that jurors must agree on the particular [citation.] the continuous-course-of-conduct exception to the unanimity requirement applies when, as here, the statute contemplates a continuous series of acts over a period of time. [citation.] there is no violation of the constitutional right to unanimous agreement on the criminal conduct because the actus reus of the offense is the course of conduct, not a people v. cissna (2010) 182 cal.app.4th 1105, 1124; people v. gear (1993) 19 cal.app.4th 86, 91-93; people v. whitham (1995) 38 cal.app.4th 1282, 1295-1298; people v. adames, supra, 54 cal.app.4th at p. 208; people v. avina (1993) 14 cal.app.4th 1303, 1308-1313; people v. cortes (1999) 71 cal.app.4th 62, 74-75.) 6 defendant maintains that three acts of molestation are an essential element of section 288.5, so each act must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. not so. while [,] unanimity on people v. higgins (1992) 9 cal.app.4th 294, 307.) where testimony regarding repeated identical offenses is presented in child molestation cases. in such cases, although the jury may not be able to readily distinguish between the various acts, it is certainly capable of unanimously agreeing that they took place in the people v. jones, supra, 51 cal.3d at p. 321.) the court noted that the is the credibility of the child: ttestimony describing consistent repetitive acts, or it will defendant will have his unanimous jury verdict [citation] and the prosecution will have proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant committed a specific act, for if the jury believes the defendant committed all the acts it necessarily believes he committed each specific act. [citations]id. at p. 322.) by being charged with a single count of continuous sexual abuse under section 288.5, defendant avoided being charged with innumerable violations of section 288potentially seven to nine criminal violations per monththat could result in a long prison sentence. in people v. jones, for example, a resident child molester charged with 28 counts of lewd and lascivious acts on children under the age of 14 could be convicted cal.3d at pp. 300, 314-count of the continuous sexual abuse of a child rather than the multiple counts available [under section 288], is a beneficiary of section 288.5 and an odd champion for its people v. higgins, supra, 9 cal.app.4th at p. 308.) 7 in any event, failure to give a unanimity instruction was harmless where, as here, the defense is that the victim lied as to all of the sexual incidents she described.3 the jury rejected the defense. in this scenario, where there is no basis to discriminate among many incidents of sexual abuse, and the jury believed the victim, the lack of a unanimity instruction is harmless. (people v. brown (1996) 42 cal.app.4th 1493, 1502.) 2. juror misconduct defendant exercised his fifth amendment right to not testify at trial. the jury was instructed that defendant has a constitutional right not to testify. jurors were not to nor let it influence their decision. violating this instruction is misconduct that gives rise be rebutted by an affirmative evidentiary record to determine whether there is a reasonable probability of actual harm resulting people v. lavender (2014) 60 cal.4th 679, 687.) defense counsel spoke to the jury foreperson outside the courtroom after trial. [defendant] so quickly was because he did not testify. she said that during deliberations some members of the jury said that they could not understand why an innocent person the foreperson told her that the jury rrecorded phone calls. the court authorized interviews with six jurors who consented to the release of their personal identification information. five of them heard absolutely no discussion s failure to testify. the sixth juror overheard a comment about 3 spanish inq 8 were not allowed to consider the topic, and it was never brought up again. based on the investigatiexercise of his right to remain silent. rather, it appears that there was a fleeting reference to this fac denial of a new trial cannot be disturbed absent (people v. staten (2000) 24 cal.4th 434, 466.) historical fapeople v. danks (2004) 32 cal.4th 269, 304; people v. leonard people v. loker (2008) 44 cal.4th 691, 747.) the record reflects that the six jurors who were interviewed after trial denied any deliberations. if someone mentioned it, it was promthe comments on this subject were brief, played no role in deliberations, and the jurors were reminded that it is not a proper subject, the presumption of prejudice is rebutted. (people v. loker, supra, 44 cal.4th at pp. 748-749.) a fleeting comment, quickly same as drawing negative inference (people v. leonard, supra, 40 cal.4th at p. 1425.) w9 people v. loker, supra, 44 cal.4th at p. 749.) given the transitory nature of the single comment identified by one juror, we conclude that defendant was not prejudiced. a new trial was unwarranted. disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. boren, p.j. we concur: ashmann-gerst, j. chavez, j.
