(b)(1)) and eight counts of dissuading a witness from testifying at trial ( 136.1, subd. (a)(1)). the trial court found roberts had three prior serious or violent felony convictions within the meaning of the three strikes law ( 667, subds. (b)-(i); 1170.12) and had served five separate prison terms for felonies ( 667.5, subd. (b)). after dismissing two of the prior strike convictions (see  1385, people v. superior court (romero) (1996) 13 cal.4th 497), the court sentenced roberts to an aggregate state prison term of 13 years. in april 2015 roberts filed in the superior court a document that consisted of a [of an] a petition for writ of habeas corpus. on may 1, 2015 the trial court construed the filing as a petition for writ of habeas corpus and, in a written decision, summarily denied it. the court directed the clerk to give notice. on july 21, 2015 he sought a ruling on his prior petitions. the court directed the clerk to serve roberts with another copy of the may 1, 2015 order denying the petitions. on august 7, 2015 roberts filed a notice of appeal from the july 21, 2015 order and what appears to be the may 1, 2015 order. 1 statutory references are to the penal code. 3 discussion we appointed counsel to represent roberts on appeal. after examination of the record, counsel filed an opening brief raising no issues. on january 14, 2016 we advised roberts he had 30 days to submit any contentions or issues he wanted us to consider. we have not received a response. attached to f appeal, however, was a document entitled opening brief that raised several issues. to the extent roberts is attempting to appeal from the order directing that the superior court clerk resend him a prior order, he is appealing from a non-appealable order. (see  1237, subd. (b) [a defendant may appeal any order after judgment affecting his or her substantial rights]; teal v. superior court (2014) 60 cal.4th 595, 600 affecting the  1237, subd. (b)] does s claim is meritorious, but instead on the nature of the s ruling thereto.) ur cases do not provide a comprehenssubstantial rights as used in section 1237, subdivision (b)people v. loper (2015) 60 cal.4th 1155, 1161, fn. 3), an order directing mailing of a prior order does not qualify as such an order. to the extent roberts is attempting to appeal from the order denying his petition for writ of habeas corpus, he is also appealing from a non-appealable order.
