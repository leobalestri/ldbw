(former  487, subd. (3), stats. 1989, ch. 930,  6.) initially placed on probation, duran was sentenced to 16 months in prison after he violated probation. in 2005, in an unrelated san diego county case, no. scs181667, a jury found duran guilty of carjacking, robbery, and unlawfully taking and driving a motor vehicle. prior grand theft of a firearm conviction served as one of two prior was sentenced as a third-strike defendant to 25 years to life for the carjacking. (see  1192.7, subd. (c)(26) on november 4, 2014, california voters enacted proposition 47, which went into effect the following day. (people v. buycks (2018) 5 cal.5th 857, 870871 (buycks); people v. 1 the record, and are not relevant to the issues presented on appeal. 2 all further undesignated statutory references are to the penal code. 3 johnson (2016) 1 cal.app.5th 953, 957.) proposition 47 amended portions of the penal and health and safety codes to reclassify as misdemeanors certain drug and theft offenses that previously 3 unless committed by ineligible offenders. (buycks, at pp. 871, 877; people v. morales (2016) 63 cal.4th 399, 404; people v. johnson, at p. 957.) as relevant here, proposition 47 added section 490.2, which provided that for eligible offenders, property does not exceed $950 shall be considered petty theft and shall be punished as a misdemeanor . . . . thus, under section 490.2 as originally enacted, theft of a firearm was a misdemeanor unless . (people v. romanowski (2017) 2 cal.5th 903, 908; people v. perkins (2016) 244 cal.app.4th 129, 132133, 141.) proposition 47 also enacted section 1170.18, which created procedures whereby eligible defendants who have suffered felony convictions of one of the enumerated crimes may petition for resentencing, or to have such convictions designated misdemeanors. (buycks, supra, 5 cal.5th at p. 871.) section 1170.18, subdivisions (f) and (g) provide that persons like duran, who have completed their felony sentences, may petition to have them designated as misdemeanors. (buycks, at p. 876, fn. 4; people v. casillas (2017) 13 cal.app.5th 745, 751.) on november 8, 2016, the voters approved proposition 63, the which became effective the 3 a special class of crime that may be charged, or punished, as either a felony or a misdemeanor. (buycks, supra, 5 cal.5th at p. 871, fn. 1; people v. park (2013) 56 cal.4th 782, 789.) 4 following day. (cal. const., art. ii, former  10, subd. (a); people v. romanowski, supra, 2 cal.5th at p. 908, fn. 2; john l. v. superior court (2004) 33 cal.4th 158, 168.) proposition 63 amended prop. 63,  11.1;  490.2, subd. (c).) thus, after enactment of proposition 63, and as of november 9, 2016, under section 487, subdivision (c), theft of a firearm is once again in an application dated november 8, 2016, but filed in the los angeles county superior court on february 14, 2017, duran applied to have his 1991 grand theft conviction reduced to a misdemeanor. he checked a box stating: the amount in question the document was not signed under penalty of perjury. duran served the document on the people prior to its filing with the court. on february 9, 2017, a deputy district attorney rdistrict attorney opposed reduction of the conviction on the ground grand theft of a firearm did not qualify for proposition 47 relief. on february 16, 2017, the trial court denied the petition because 7 4 discussion in his opening brief, duran does not appear to dispute that, once proposition 63 took effect, his offense was no longer eligible 4 filed a request for relief with this court. his application for relief was followed by an amended motion for relief filed by appointed appellate counsel, which this court granted. 5 for reduction to a misdemeanor. he also does not dispute that his application was not actually filed in the trial court until february 14, 2017. -delivery ust be deemed to have been constructively filed as of november 8, 2016, before proposition 63 took effect. therefore, he argues, he was entitled to have his grand theft conviction reduced to a misdemeanor. implicit in his argument is the assumption that the applicable law was that which was in effect on the date his motion was filed, rather than on the date of the people argue that duran has failed to establish that he met the requirements of the prison-delivery rule; the court properly denied the application because duran failed to establish the firearm $950 or less; and in any event, retroactively. we conclude duran has failed to establish that the prison- delivery rule applies. accordingly, even assuming the law should be applied as it stood on november 8, 2016 (the date the document was purportedly mailed) and that duran sufficiently established the value of the stolen firearm, he has nonetheless failed to show the trial court erred. 1. the prison-delivery rule --a self-deemed timely filed if, within the relevant period, the prisoner properly submitted the notice to prison authorities for forwarding to the clerk of the superior court, pursuant to the procedures established for prisoner mail. (silverbrand v. county of los angeles (2009) 46 cal.4th 106, 110 (silverbrand); in re jordan 6 (1992) 4 cal.4th 116, 118.) the prison-delivery rule ensures that an unrepresented defendant, who is confined during the period comply with the filing requirements fully comparable to that provided to a defendant who is represented by counsel or who is silverbrand, at p. 110.) silverbrand that incarcerated persons are unable to personally travel to the courthouse or readily ensure a notice of appeal is filed. (silverbrand, supra, 46 cal.4th at p. 118.) the prison-delivery rule use of judicial resources by -substantial, administrative burden that would be imposed were courts required to determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether a delivered to prison authorities filing in re jordan, supra, 4 cal.4th at p. 119; silverbrand, at p. 119.) silverbrand extended the prison-delivery rule to civil cases, and observed that it had been applied to other filings by self-represented, incarcerated persons, including petitions for postconviction relief and motions. (id. at pp. 110, 123124, 129.) 2. application of the prison-delivery rule duran points to two documents in support of his contention that the prison-delivery rule applies: (1) a proof of service, stating that he placed the proposition 47 application in a u.s. mail deposit box at high desert state prison, and mailed it to the angeles, on november 8, 2016; -119 special 7 the prison to the criminal justice center, located at 210 west temple street in los angeles, on november 10, 2016, and sent another document to the los angeles county district attorney, at the same address, on november 16, 2016. duran argues that the proof of service purportedly attached to his proposition 47 application demonstrates he gave prison authorities the petition on november 8, 2016. therefore, he posits, his application should be deemed constructively filed on november 8, 2016; proposition 63 did not take effect until the next day; and therefore the former version of section 490.2 applied and he was entitled to resentencing. the people counter that the prison-delivery rule is inapplicable because (1) the proof of service states duran placed his document in a mailbox, rather than giving it to prison authorities; (2) he failed to provide a copy of the envelope in which he purportedly mailed the document; (3) he did not mail anything on november 8; and (4) the proof of service indicates the proposition 47 application was sent to the district attorney, not the superior court. we agree that the prison-delivery rule applies to proposition 47 petitions filed by incarcerated, self-represented defendants. (see silverbrand, supra, 46 cal.4th at pp. 123124 [prison-delivery rule has been applied in regard to petitions for postconviction relief, motions, and other filings].) is inapplicable because duran placed the document in the mail, rather than handed it to prison staff; the existence of the mail log suggests placing the document in the mail was the proper procedure. we are also not convinced that the absence of an 8 outgoing envelope is significant, as it is not entirely clear how duran could be expected to retrieve such a postmarked envelope. on the other hand, we do not believe that the documents duran presents demonstrate that the prison-delivery rule applies. the proof of service states the proposition 47 petition was sent to the district attorney, not the court clerk. to avail himself of the rule, duran must show he sent the document to the court. (see silverbrand, supra, 46 cal.4th at pp. 110notice of appeal by an incarcerated self-represented litigant in a civil case should be deemed filed as of the date the prisoner properly submitted the notice to prison authorities for forwarding to the clerk of the superior court houston v. lack (1988) 487 u.s. 266, 270271 [notice of appeal timely when delivered to prison authorities for forwarding to the district court,hernandez v. spearman (9th cir. 2014) rule . . . the petition must be delivered to prison authorities for ) certainly, delivering to prison authorities a document meant for filing with the court, but addressed to some other entity or person, does not fall within the rule. the prison-that the time of the filing constructively occurs, as a matter of law, when the self-represented prisoner properly delivers the notice to the prison authorities for forwarding to the superior court clerksilverbrand, at pp. 120121, italics added.) thus, the proof of service does not show duran gave the document to prison officials for filing with the court on november 8. nor does the special purpose letters log suffice to bring the issue within the purview of the prison-delivery rule. the log indicates that duran sent a document from the prison to the 9 criminal justice center, located at 210 west temple street in los angeles, on november 10, 2016. while both the los angeles county criminal court and the district alocated at that address, viewing the log in conjunction with the proof of service, it appears this entry refers to the application that, according to the proof of service, duran sent to the district attorney. the second entry, showing a document sent to the district attorney on november 16, 2016, does not assist duran in establishing he placed a document in the mail to the court on november 8. given that the log shows mail went out from the prison on november 10, if duran had placed a document in the mail addressed to the court on november 8, it would have gone out at least with the november 10, 2016 mail. the fact he sent a does not show he placed his application, addressed to the court, in the prison mail on the 8th.5 for the first time in his reply brief, duran states that his ecause he attempted, in 2015, to have his grand theft firearm conviction reduced to a misdemeanor in the 5 duran also filed, in support of his motion for relief from failure to file a timely notice of appeal, a declaration signed under penalty of perjury, petition for reli[e]f under prop. 47 to the l.a. superior court in case no. pa005661- duran does not argue that this document supports application of the prison-delivery rule. a declaration can be sufficient to trigger the prison-delivery rule, if it provides the requisite information. (see generally silverbrand, supra, 46 cal.4th at p. 112.) but, here the application was not actually declaration fails to provide any information from which we could conclude the prison-delivery rule applied. 10 incorrect court. he argues that he mistakenly filed a proposition 47 petition in san diego county superior court, seeking to have his grand theft firearm convictionwhich was suffered in los angeles countyreduced to a misdemeanor, and then attempted to appeal the adverse ruling on that application, including via a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. citing norgart v. upjohn co. (1999) 21 cal.4th 6 il for several reasons. o]rdinarily, we do not consider arguments raised for the first time in a reply (people v. aguayo (2019) 31 cal.app.5th 758, 768) and duran has provided no reason for us to depart from this practice. (people v. duff (2014) 58 cal.4th 527, 550, fn. 9; people v. smithey (1999) 20 cal.4th 936, 1017, fn. 26; people v. clayburg (2012) 211 cal.app.4th 86, 93.) -consisting of a single conclusory sentence and citation. (see people v. aguayo, supra, 31 cal.app.5th at p. 768 [failure to develop an argument results in forfeiture of the argument on appeal]; people v. clayburg, supra, 211 cal.app.4th at p. 93 [points perfunctorily asserted without argument in support are 6 as duran requests, we take judicial notice of various documents related to the san diego proceedings. (evid. code,  452, subd.

(barrington v. a.h. robins co. (1985) 39 cal.3d 146, 150.) under that doctrine, an amended complaint is deemed to have been filed at the time of an earlier complaint if it rests on the same general set of facts, involves the same injury, and refers to the same instrumentality as did the original complaint. (brown v. ralphs grocery co. (2018) 28 cal.app.5th 824, 841; norgart v. upjohn co., supra, 21 cal.4th at pp. 408409; quiroz v. seventh ave. center (2006) 140 cal.app.4th 1256, 1278.) duran fails to explain how this doctrine applies in the instant matter, where the document at issue is a proposition 47 application, not a complaint. for the foregoing reasons, the superior court did not err by application. in light of our conclusion, we need s that proposition 63 was retroactive, or that duran failed to establish the firearm he stole in 1991 was valued at $950 or less.7 7 we requested that the parties provide supplemental question of which version of section 490.2 applied. in light of our conclusion that duran has failed to establish applicability of the prison-delivery rule, we need not further address this issue. 12 disposition judicial notice is granted. not to be published in the official reports edmon, p. j. we concur: lavin, j. egerton, j.
