( 1237.5; cal. rules of court, rule 8.304(b); people v. mendez (1999) 19 cal.4th 1084, 1095.) absent a certificate of probable cause, a defendant may appeal from a plea of guilty on non-certificate grounds if the notice of appeal states that the appeal is based on [t]he denial of a motion to suppress evidence under . . . section 1538.5 (cal. rules of court, rule 8.304(b)(4)(a)) or is on [g]rounds that arose after entry of the plea and do not affect the pleas validity (cal. rules of court, rule 8.304(b)(4)(b); see people v. mendez, supra, 19 cal.4th at p. 1096, citing former cal. rules of court, rule 31(d), now, in pertinent part, rule 8.304(b)(4).) thus, to the extent defendant challenges the failure to disclose exculpatory evidence, his inability to uncover evidence at trial, or procure a use of force expert, these are issues that arose preplea and are barred on appeal by the trial courts denial of his certificate of probable cause. to the extent defendant claims that the district attorney or the los angeles police department lost his personal property or failed to return it after 3 defendant filed the same letter brief in this appeal as he did in appeal no. b240820, raising the same issues. 5 promising to do so as part of his plea agreement. the proper procedure for him is to file a claim with those entities or a petition for a writ of habeas corpus or both. we have examined the entire record and are satisfied that defendant's attorneys have fully complied with their responsibilities and that no arguable issues exist. (people v. kelly, supra, 40 cal.4th at pp. 109110; people v. wende (1979) 25 cal.3d 436, 441.) disposition the judgment is affirmed. johnson, j. we concur: mallano, p. j. rothschild, j.
