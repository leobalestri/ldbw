(a)(2)), a serious felony ( 1192.7, subd. (c)(23)) and found he had personally used a firearm to commit the offense ( 12022.5). in a bifurcated proceeding the trial court found true the special allegations withers had two prior convictions for robbery within the meaning of the three strikes law. ( 667, subds. (b)-(i); 1170.12). the court sentenced withers to an aggregate state prison term of 30 years to life. (people v. withers (nov. 19, 2003, b162764) [nonpub. opn.].) on november 13, 2014 the trial court denied with prejudice wi petition for recall of sentence pursuant to section 1170.126 on the ground that withers was ineligible for resentencing ( 1170.126, subd. (e)). withers appealed. we appointed counsel to represent withers on appeal. after examining the record, counsel filed an opening brief that did not raise any issues. on march 11, 2015 we advised withers that he had 30 days to submit a brief raising any contentions or issues he wanted us to consider. after granting an extension of time, we received from withers on april 29, 2015 an 18-page typed attached exhibits. withers argues that his resentencing. withers argues that under people v. vargas (2014) 59 cal.4th 635 his prior robbery convictions should not have counted as two separate strikes. on june 9, 2015, withers filed a request that we take judicial notice of in re alejandro b. (2015) 236 cal.app.4th 705, a decision he maintains supported his position. we have examined the entire record and are satisfied attorney on appeal has fully complied with the responsibilities of counsel and there are no arguable issues. (see smith v. robbins (2000) 528 u.s. 259, 277-284 [120 s.ct. 746, 145 l.ed.2d 756]; 1 all statutory references are to the penal code. 3 people v. kelly (2006) 40 cal.4th 106, 112-113; people v. wende (1979) 25 cal.3d 436, 441.) brief, denied petition for writ of mandate to compel the trial court to resentence him on the ground that under vargas his prior robbery convictions did not count as two separate strikes. in that order, we explained that, because the record showed his two prior robbery convictions were against separate victims, withers is not entitled to resentencing. in re alejandro b., supra, 236 cal.app.4th 705, is not to the contrary. in re alejandro b. did not involve prior convictions. in that case the court of appeal reversed commitment offenses arising out of a single act, holding that the juvenile court should have stayed imposition of sentence, rather than dismissing, one of the two counts.
