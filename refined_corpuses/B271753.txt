(a), 530.5, subd. (a)).2 the trial court found true the allegations that defendant had suffered a prior conviction within the meaning of the three strikes law ( 667, subds. (b)-(j), 1170.12) and had served three prior prison terms ( 667.5, subd. (b)), and sentenced defendant claims on appeal involve his convictions for unlawful possession of an assault weapon ( 30605) and for unlawful assault weapon activity ( 30600). he bear arms and section 30600 is unconstitutionally overbroad because it prohibits a substantial amount of activity protected by the second amendment.3 defendant did not make these claims in the trial court, and has forfeited them because they raise factual questions which cannot be resolved by the record on appeal. accordingly, we affirm the judgment of conviction. background around 12:30 a.m. on may 28, 2015, torrance police department officer matthew concannon parked his undercover vehicle in the driveway of 1 all further undesignated statutory references are to the penal code. 2 the jury acquitted defendant of the count 7 and 8 burglary charges. 3 defendant is a convicted felon who is barred from possessing any firearm. ( 29800.) thus, he could not lawfully possess or sell an assault weapon even if we were to strike down sections 30600 and 30605. the trial court imposed punishment for defendanand imposed and stayed sentence for his violation of section 30605. accordingly, defendant may challenge the two sections. 3 -issued colt m4 assault rifle was inside the vehicle. when the officer returned to his vehicle at 7:00 a.m., he discovered that the rifle, as well as a camera and its charger, were missing. defendant was arrested on june 2, 2015, on suspicion of committing a number of crimes. a stolen .45-caliber handgun was found in his car.4 the era was also found in the car. vehicle between 2:34 and 2:36 a.m. on may and texts on may 28 to ashton coleman. coleman told police that defendant him to keep. when coleman called defendant about the gun later, defendant said it had already been sold. discussion a. section 30605 section 30605 prohibits the possession of any assault weapon, including an m4 rifle, with certain exceptions not applicable here. defendant contends amendment as explained in district of columbia v. heller (2008) 554 u.s. 570 (heller).5 4 felon in possession of a firearm in violation of section 29800. 5 the united states supreme court has held that the second amendment right to keep and bear arms, as recognized in heller, applies to the states. (mcdonald v. city of chicago (2010) 561 u.s. 742.) 4 respondent contends that defendant has forfeited this claim by failing to raise it in the trial court. (in re sheena k. (2007) 40 cal.4th 875, 880-881 (sheena k)unconstitutionality individual facts and circumstances but instead requires the review of id. at p. 885.) the california supreme court did not hold or imply in sheena k. that a facial challenge never requires scrutiny of facts. the court found that the constitutional challenge to the probation condition before it presented a pure which a probation (sheena k., supra, 40 cal.4th at p. 889.) a facial challenge to the constitutionality of a statute is simply one particular circumstances of an individual. tobe v. city of santa ana course, the most difficult challenge to mount successfully, since the challenger must establish that no set of valid circumstances exists under united states v. salerno (1987) 481 u.s. 739, 745.)6 question of law. as we explain below, the challenge turns on questions of fact. 6 as the california supreme court has acknowledged, the standard governing a facial challenge to the constitutional validity of a statute has been the subject of controversykasler v. lockyer (2000) 23 cal.4th 472, 502.) because we find that defendantquestions of fact and is forfeited, we need not elect one of the standards mentioned in kasler. 5 necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for heller, supra, 544 u.s. at p. 626.) the second self-id. at p. 624.) t protect those weapons not typically possessed by law-abiding citizens for lawful purposes, such as short-barreled idbanned. (id. at p. 627.) an m-16 rifle is a current example of a without violating the second amendment. (ibid.) a short-barreled shotgun is another example of an unusual weapon which may be banned. (id. at p. 625.) thus, resolution of dweapons are (1) weapons in common use which are typically possessed by law-abiding citizens for lawful purposes or (2) dangerous and unusual weapons like an m-16 rifle or short-barreled shotgun. these are questions of fact. defendant contends, in effect, that there is no question of fact because heller defendant is mistaken. as defendant acknowledges, two california courts which have considered challenges to section 30605 or its predecessor, section 12280, have found that assault weapons are dangerous and unusual weapons which may be banned: people v. james (2009) 174 cal.app.4th 662 (james) and people v. zondorak (2013) 220 cal.app.4th 829 (zondorak). in james, the third 6 district court of appeal relied on the legislative history of the roberti-roos assault weapons control act and .50 caliber bmg regulation act (collectively, awca) to find that the legislature viewed assault rifles as not the types of weapons that are typically possessed by law-abiding citizens for lawful purposes such as sport hunting or self-defense; rather these are -barreled shotgun at issue in united states v. miller [(1939) 307 u.s. 174],the holding of which was apparently approved by heller. (james, at p. 677.) thus, the court held, assault weapons are not protected by the second amendment and may be banned. in zondorak, the fourth district court of appeal found that the extensive legislative history cited by the james court supported its conclusion that assault weapons are at least as dangerous and unusual as a short-barreled shotgun; the zondorak court agreed with that assessment. (zondorak, supra, 220 cal.app.4th at p. 837.) the zondorak court -16-type weapons that heller likewise appeared to conclude were outside the id. at p. 836.) 7 defendant argues that james and zondorak are wrongly decided in light of the holdings of new york state rifle and pistol ass'n v. cuomo (2d cir. 2015) 804 f.3d 242 (new york rifle) and heller v. district of columbia 7 the fourth circuit has now reached a similar conclusion and has held that assault weapons such as the ar--16 rifles and are weapons of war and so fall outside the second amendment and may be banned. (kolbe v. hogan (2017) ____ f.3d ___, ___ [2017 u.s. app. lexis 2930, *47-50].) 7 (d.c. cir. 2011) 670 f.3d 1244 (heller ii). he contends the federal cases 8 defendant is correct that the second circuit and the d.c. circuit both conclude that ar-he overlooks the fact that the courts reached their conclusion on the basis of evidence presented in the district court and therefore included in the record on appeal. (new york rifle, supra, 804 f.3d at p. 255; heller ii, supra, 670 f.3d at p. 1261.) we are reluctant to rely on the factual conclusions in these cases. the second circuit found that almost 4 million ar-15 assault rifles were manufactured between 1986 and 2013 and comprised 2 percent of the new york rifle, supra, 804 f.3d at p. 255.) the d.c. circuit, writing in 2011, found that 1.6 million ar-firearms. (heller ii, supra, 670 f.3d at p. 1261.) we have no way of evaluating or reconciling these broad numbers, and because defendant did not raise his claim in the trial court, there is no evidence in the record before us of the current number of assault weapons in the country or of the number in common use. further, even if we were to adopt the conclusions of new york rifle and heller ii that certain assault weapons are in common use, that would only fill 8 when defendant filed his briefs in this matter, the fourth circuit had granted rehearing en banc in kolbe v. hogan (4th cir. 2016) 813 f.3d 160 (rehg. granted mar. 4, 2016), but had not yet issued an opinion following rehearing. defendant relied in part on that now-vacated 2016 opinion to argue that james and zondorak were wrongly decided and that assault weapons are protected by the second amendment. that reliance is now misplaced. 8 looked for but did not find evidence showing that the weapons were commonly or typically possessed by law-abiding citizens for lawful purposes. (new york rifle, supra, 804 f.3d at pp. 256-257 [evidence in the record does and large- by law-abiding citizens heller ii, supra, 670 f.3d at p. 1261 [based upon the record as it stands, we cannot be certain whether these weapons are commonly used or are useful specifically for self-is no evidence in the record in this case which would permit us to make such a determination. as the facts of this case show, some assault weapons are owned by law enforcement agencies, and some are acquired by criminals. assuming, arguendo, some are owned by law-abiding citizens for lawful purposes, there is no evidence of how many, or of . both the second circuit and the d.c. circuit elected to assume for the sake of argument that assault weapons were commonly or typically possessed by law-abiding citizens for lawful purposes because the courts believed that intermediate scrutiny was the appropriate standard of review and the prohibitions survive that standard. (new york rifle, supra, 804 f.3d at p. 257, fn. we proceed on the assumption that these laws ban weapons protected by the second amendment. this assumption is warranted at this stage, because, as explained post . . . the statutes at issue nonetheless largely heller ii, supra, 670 f.3d at p. 1not resolve that question [of typical use], however, because even assuming [the laws] do impinge upon the right protected by the second amendment, we 9 think intermediate scrutiny is the appropriate standard of review and the prohibitions survi9 defendant, however, objects to the application of intermediate scrutiny or any other interest-balancing test. he contends that heller categorically prohibits the ban of any weapon in common use by law-abiding citizens for a lawful sake of argument that assault weapons are commonly or typically possessed by citizens for lawful purposes and strike down section 30605 on the basis of that assumption. this we cannot do. (united states v. salerno, supra, 481 u.s. at p. 745 kasler v. lockyer, supra, 23 cal.4th at p. 502 e showing required .) be resolved on appeal. his claim is forfeited by his failure to raise it in the trial court and thereby develop an adequate record. (sheena k., supra, 40 cal.4th at pp. 880-881, 889.) b. section 30600 with exceptions not relevant here, section 30600, subdivision (a) prohibits the manufacture, distribution, transport, import, lending or involvement in the sale of any assault weapon. defendant contends the 9 the fourth circuit now agrees that if a weapon is protected by the second amendment, a ban of that weapon is subject to intermediate scrutiny. (kolbe v. hogan, supra, ___ f.3d at p. __ [2017 u.s. app. lexis at pp. *47-50].) the fourth circuit further ruled that the assault weapon ban before it would be constitutional under that scrutiny. (ibid.) we note that the seventh circuit court of appeals has also found a ban on assault weapons constitutional, although it employs a different analysis than the d.c., second and fourth circuits use. (friedman v. city of highland park (7th cir. 2015) 784 f.3d 406.) 10 statute is unconstitutionally overbroad because it prohibits activities that must be protected by the second amendment for that right not to be rendered meaningless. defendant has forfeited this claim by failing to raise it in the trial court. (in re sheena k., supra, 40 cal.4th at pp. 880-881.) further, as defendant acknowledges, this claim is dependent on the success of his previous claim that the second amendment protects the ownership of assault weapons and invalidates section 30605. that claim has been forfeited as well, as we explained, ante. disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. goodman, j.* we concur: chavez, j., acting p.j. hoffstadt, j. * retired judge of the los angeles superior court assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
