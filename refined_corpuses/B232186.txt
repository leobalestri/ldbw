(c)),1 one count of unlawful oral copulation with a minor ( 288a, subd. (b)(i)), and one count of contact with a minor with intent to commit a sexual offense ( 288.3, subd. (a)). on february 17, 2011, the jury found defendant guilty on all counts. the trial court sentenced defendant to a term of imprisonment of 3 years, 8 months. additional post conviction orders, fines and assessments were imposed. in light of the limited issue on appeal, we need not recite in detail the underlying facts. it is sufficient that on november 4, 2009, defendant, then 42 years old, met the 16-year-old victim on a chat website. there ensued a series of texts, messages and phone calls that eventually turned sexual in nature. over the next few weeks, they met several times and engaged in sexual intercourse and oral copulation. at trial, the prosecution alscrimes with another minor. discussion the only claim of error raised by defendant is that the trial court improperly denied his motion to represent himself under faretta v. california (1975) 422 u.s. 806. 1 all undesignated statutory references are to the penal code. 1. facts related to faretta motion on several occasions prior to trial, defendant expressed displeasure with the manner his trial counsel was handling the case and requested new counsel. the trial court held appropriate marsden motions on december 16, 2010, february 10, 2011, and february 14, 2011.2 on each occasion the trial court denied the marsden motion, and defendant does not challenge those rulings. in the midst of the hearing on the marsden motion of february 10, 2011, during an exchange between the court and defendant, the get a new attorney, i want to exert my faretta and asked her to reply to what defendant had said in conjunction with his marsden motion. counsel responded to the points that defendant had raised. after formally denying the marsden motion, the court revisited the self representation issue, and the following exchange occurred: you wanted to waive your faretta rights and represent yourself, if i denied it. -huh. the court: for trial? 2 people v. marsden (1970) 2 cal.3d 118. would be moving to continue this case because you are not ready to proceed to trial when the jury appears tomorrow (sic)?[3 -representation is not timely; that his counsel and all counsel have announced ready in the master calendar court for trial. the case has come before the court for trial. all pretrial matters have been heard. counsel has indicated her status is still ready for trial and jurors have been ordered for tomorrow morning. commence trial and has indicated that he would be requesting a 30-day calendar days request to represent himself as not timely made and that he is not ready to proceed in this matter. 2. faretta motion the legal standards for ruling on a faretta motion are in large part a function of pro se is timely interposed, a trial court must permit a defendant to represent himself upon ascertaining that he has voluntarily and intelligently elected to do so, irrespective of how unwise such 3 the court appears to have misspoken about the next court date, prompting the 10, court day, february 11, which was a court holiday, and it appears the initial jury panel was called to the courtroom on monday february 14, 2011. people v. windham (1977) 19 cal.3d 121, 128.) the rule is different if the motion is untimely. in such a case abuse of discretion.4 (people v. horton (1995) 11 cal.4th 1068, 1110; people v. bradford (2010) 187 cal.app.4th 1345, 1354.) faretta motion was untimely, stating that counsel had announced ready for trial; the parties were before the judge who was to try the case; all pretrial matters had been heard, and jurors had been ordered. the record also showed that witnesses had been subpoenaed or their attendance arranged. we agree with the trial court. charges were originally filed against defendant on november 9, 2010; the underlying crimes had taken place a year earlier. there had been numerous court appearances, and the faretta motion was made virtually on the eve of trial. (all the intervening days between the motion and the start of trial were either weekend days or a court holiday.) these facts are in keeping with the holdings in a number of cases upholding the denial of a faretta motion as untimely. (see people v. valdez (2004) 32 cal.4th 73, 102 [day of trial]; people v. horton, supra, 11 cal.4th at p. 1110 [day of trial]; people v. scott (2001) 91 cal.app.4th 1197, 1204-1205 [four days before trial]; people v. ruiz (1983) 142 cal.app.3d 780, 790-792 [six days before trial].) that defendant had made only a few court appearances does not change the analysis. he had earlier opportunities to ask for self representation and did not. even if a faretta request is untimely, the trial court retains discretion to grant self-representation. (people v. windham, supra, 19 cal.3d at pp. 127-129.) we conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion. not only was the trial set to start the next court day, defendant expressly stated that if his faretta request were granted, he would not be ready for trial and would be asking for a 30 day continuance. the case involved sexual assaults, the relevant events took place over a year earlier, and the key witnesses were 4 whether we review the timeliness issue de novo or by the abuse of discretion standard (see people v. marshall (1997) 15 cal.4th 1, 25; people v. moore (1988) 47 cal.3d 63, 80), our conclusion would be the same. minors. the trial court acted within his discretion in denyfaretta motion. faretta request it was not unequivocal. (people v. scott, supra, 91 cal.app.4th at pp. 1205-faretta request came immediately on the heels of the marsden sincere desire to represent himself. disposition the judgment is affirmed. rubin, j. we concur: bigelow, p. j. grimes, j.
