(pen. code,  187, subd. (a).)1 the jury found true the special circumstance allegation that appellant committed multiple murders. ( 190, subd. (a)(3).) as to count 1, the jury also found true the allegations that appellant personally used and intentionally discharged a firearm (a handgun), causing death. ( 12022.53, subds. (b)-(d).) as to count 2, the jury found true the allegation that appellant personally used a deadly weapon (a knife) ( 12022, subd. (b)(1)), but returned a not true finding on the section 186.22, subdivision (b)(1)(c) gang allegation. following a bench trial, the court found true the prior serious felony allegation pursuant to section 667, subdivision (a)(1). the trial court sentenced appellant on count 1 to a term of life without the possibility of parole, plus five years consecutive pursuant to section 667, subdivision (a)(1), and an additional 25 years to life pursuant to section 12022.53, subdivision (d). on count 2 the trial court imposed a term of life without the possibility of parole, plus one year pursuant to section 12022, subdivision (b)(1). appellant received 946 days of presentence custody credit. appellant contends: (1) prosecutorial misconduct rendered constitutional rights to due process; (2) the

defense, to due process, and to a fair trial; and (3) the we disagree and affirm the judgment of conviction. appellant further seeks remand for reconsideration of his firearm enhancement pursuant to senate bill no. 620,2 which amended section 12022.53, subdivision (h) to remove the prohibition on striking firearm enhancements. because we find no realistic possibility that the trial court would exercise its new discretion under section 12022.53, subdivision (h) to dismiss the we decline his remand request. however, we do agree with the parties that appellant is entitled to an additional 366 days of presentence custody credits. accordingly, the trial court is ordered to modify the judgment to forward a corrected abstract of judgment to the california department of corrections and rehabilitation. factual background 1. count 2: the 2005 murder of gilbert jaramillo on october 29, 2005, carina martinez hosted an outdoor halloween party attended by about 150 to 200 people. between 1:30 a.m. and 2:00 a.m., carina broke up a fight in which two or three men were punching caground. carina sent gilbert up to the second level of the patio, and joined him a few moments later. within seconds, carina 2 statutes 2017, chapter 682, section 2. 4 heard two gunshots. at the sound of the gunfire people began to scatter, jumping over the fences or running out the front gate. carina went to the front yard and saw that someone had been shot. as gilbert passed carina on his way out, he said to her, then disappeared through the front gate. a group of friends, including ivan mainor banuelos and appellant. joey had known mainor since middle school, and was childhood best friends with appellant. during the party, gilbert mainor and appellant had been stabbed at a party a year earlier, joey related to them what gilbert had said. a fight broke out, and joey and mainor started kicking and punching gilbert. mainor was chased from the fight, but returned with a knife and stabbed gilbert once or twice in his right arm. gilbert tried to run away but mainor and appellant chased him. gilbert tripped mainor, and appellant continued the pursuit past the gate toward the street. joey was struck by a small caliber bullet, possibly a .22. after joey returned home from the hospital, appellant and mainor reported that mainor had stabbed gilbert first, and then appellant told joey he had stabbed gilbert in the neck and possibly in the heart. according to mainor, appellant and mainor threw the knives in the sewer. 5 gilbert suffered six stab wounds, including a fatal stab wound to the center of his chest which struck his heart. he also suffered blunt force trauma to his head, back, arms, and legs, found the morning after the party in the front yard of a house right side with his face in the grass, and the muzzle of a gun protruding from under his face. the gun turned out to be a semiautomatic .40 caliber handgun. it had no round in the chamber, no magazine, and could not be fired. gilbert was wearing a gun holster on his waist, and it appeared he may have been holding the gun when he died. joey and mainor were both arrested and charged with manslaughter and served prison sentences. appellant was also arrested in connection with the murder on february 20, 2007, but no charges were filed at that time. during an interview following his arrest, appellant admitted he was at the party, but claimed he arrived after the fighting was over, and was just walking up to the house as shots were fired and people started to run away. appellant saw his friend joey had been shot and was lying on the ground. appellant also told detectives about a party he attended in 2003 at which he had been stabbed and joey was beaten. later in the interview, appellant admitted that during the party joey had pointed out the person who had stabbed appellant at the previous party. however, appellant denied involvement in any fight, having a knife at the party, or chasing anyone down. he 6 2. count 1: the murder of gorgonio quintanilla on february 4, 2013 gorgonio quintanilla lived with his parents in an apartment on chanslor avenue in los

returned home and after repeated unanswered calls, horalia called the police. the next day, on february 5, 2013, shortly before 5:00 p.m., gorgonio was found dead in his car on grand avenue and 74th

appellant confesses to both murders in recorded conversations with a confidential jailhouse informant. appellant was arrested on march 26, 2013 in connection cell with two confidential jailhouse informants, one of whom was wearing a wire. in the course of over 10 hours of recorded conversations between appellant and the informants, appellant admitted both murders. during these conversations

in a (people v. garbutt (1925) 197 cal. 200, 209; see also people v. price r a .) appellant argues in light of the standards governing review of prosecutor who uses deceptive or reprehensible methods

the absence of objection and describe the homicides ordinarily forfeits such a claim on appeal. (people v. winbush (2017) 2 cal.5th 402, 481 a defendant may not complain on appeal of prosecutorial misconduct unless in a timely fashionand on the same groundthe defendant made an 11 assignment of misconduct and requested that the jury be admonished to people v. fuiava (2012) 53 cal.4th 622, 679.) similarly, as appellant concedes, claims of judicial misconduct are not preserved for appellate review in the absence of any objection on those grounds in the trial court. (people v. sturm (2006) 37 cal.4th 1218, 1237.) s failure to object and to request an admonition may be excused where it appears on the record that an objection would have been futile or an admonition ineffective. (people v. centeno (2014) 60 cal.4th 659, 674; people v. fuiava, supra, 53 cal.4th at p. 679.) but nothing in this record indicates an objection would have been futile or that curative action would have been ineffective. (cf. people v. hill (1998) 17 cal.4th 800, 820821.) to the contrary, throughout the trial, the court was responsive to defense objections, giving no indication of any court sustained the objection, there is nothing to suggest the court would have refused to admonish the jury or the prosecutor, much less that any such admonition would not have cured any a timely objection allows the court to remedy the situati(people v. taylor (1982) 31 cal.3d 488, 496), and an objection in this case would have given the trial court the opportunity to avert any might have caused. (see people v. williams (2017) 7 cal.app.5th 644, 686.) appellant has thus forfeited his claim of prosecutorial misconduct. 12 c. assistance of counsel. appellant contends that, despite the absence of any seek an admonition from the trial court amounted to ineffective deficient because it fell below an objective standard of reasonableness under prevailing professional norms, and (2) people v. centeno, supra, 60 cal.4th at p. 674, citing strickland v. washington (1984) 466 u.s. 668, 688, 694.) prejudice in this context means a reasonable probabilis failings, the result would have been mo (in re crew (2011) 52 cal.4th 126, 150.) a reasonable probability, in turn, (strickland v. washington, supra, at p. 694; in re champion (2014) 58 cal.4th 965, 1007.) appeal sheds no light on why counsel acted or failed to act in the manner challenged[,] . . . unless counsel was asked for an explanation and failed to provide one, or unless there simply rejec people v. carrasco (2014) 59 cal.4th 924, 982; people v. avena (1996) 13 cal.4th 394, 418419.) because the decision whether to object is inherently tactical, the failure to do 13 so will rarely establish ineffective assistance.

(ibid.) in circumstances in which a finding of malice is precluded, an unlawful homicide will be limited to voluntary manslaughter, even though the offense was committed with intent to kill. (people v. rios (2000) 23 cal.4th 450, 460 (rios).) -defense is a complete defense to murder (people v. anderson (2002) 28 cal.4th 767, 782; people v. randle (2005) 35 cal.4th 987, 994, overruled on other grounds in people v. chun (2009) 45 cal.4th 1172, 1201), -defense reduces the offense to the lesser included offense of manslaughter.

[citation.] second degree murder is the unlawful killing of a human being with malice aforethought but without the additional elements, such as willfulness, premeditation, and deliberation, that would support a conviction of first degree murder. (people v. beltran (2013) 56 cal.4th 935, 942 (beltran).) 17 for a killing to be justified as self-defense, the defendant must have actually believed in the need to defend based on a fear of imminent harm, and that belief must have been objectively reasonable. (people v. humphrey (1996) 13 cal.4th 1073, 1082.) imperfect self-defense differs in that, while the defendant holds the subjective belief in the need for self-defense in the face of imminent harm, that belief is objectively unreasonable. (ibid.) imperfect self-defense obviates malice because that most with an actual belief that the lethal s own death or rios, supra, 23 cal.4th at p. 461, italics omitted.) neither the perfect nor imperfect self-defense doctrine may defendant who, through his own wrongful conduct (e.g., the initiation of a physical assault or the commission of a felony), has created circumstances under which people v. rangel (2016) 62 cal.4th 1192, 1226, quoting in re christian s., supra, 7 cal.4th at p. 773, fn. 1.) similarly, when the defendant initiates the conflict which leads to the necessity for killing his adversary, the right to stand his ground is not immediately available to him, but, instead, he must first decline to carry on the affray and must honestly endeavor to escape from it. only when he has done so will the law justify him in thereafter standing his ground and killing his antagonistpeople v. holt (1944) 25 cal.2d 59, 66.) an intentional killing may also be reduced from murder to manslaughter if it occurs upon a sudden quarrel or in the heat of passion on sufficient provocation.

[citations.] the provocative conduct by the victim may be physical or verbal, but the conduct must be sufficiently provocative that it would cause an ordinary person of average disposition to act rashly or without due deliberation and reflection. (moye, supra, 47 cal.4th at pp. 549550.) claim of provocation cannot be based on events for which the defendant is culpably responsible.people v. oropeza (2007) 151 cal.app.4th 73, 83.) nor may a defendant provoke a fight, become the aggressor, and, without first seeking to withdraw from the conflict, kill an adversary and expect to reduce the crime to manslaughter by merely asserting that it was accomplished upon a sudden quarrel or in the heat of passion.(ibid.) 19 as for the subjective element of voluntary manslaughter based on provocation, the high court has explained that the must be shthe actual influence induced by such provocation.

(people v. young (2005) 34 cal.4th 1149, 1200; people v. day (1981) 117 cal.app.3d 932, 936 .) -defense and voluntary manslaughter theories rest on a single yard with a holster on his waistband and an unloaded .40-caliber gun in his hand. appellant argues that because no one witnessed exactly transpired between the victim and his killer, this evidence was sufficient to support a reasonable inference that appellant killed gilbert in self-defense or as a result of sudden quarrel or heat of passion. but evidence that the victim was found apparently holding a gun is not enough by itself to support such an inference, and there is no other evidence to back up a self-defense or voluntary manslaughter theory. indeed, not only 20 any involvement in the confrontation with gilbert, but they are also directly contradicted by his admissions to the informant and other evidence in the case. appellant vehemently denied involvement in the fight or having a knife, much less chasing or stabbing anyone. when the officer suggested he might have acted in self-defense, appellant appellant admitted that he stabbed the victim in the chest area after he had chased him from the party. and appellant denied to hide and was unarmed. in addition, both mainor and joey described a fight in which gilbert was kicked, punched and stabbed, and then chased down by appellant and stabbed again. appellant also told joey appeared to pose any threat, and mainor specifically told police that gilbert was unarmed. indeed, nothing in these accounts suggested that appellant was in fear or actually believed he was in imminent danger of being killed or suffering great bodily injury. (see people v. humphrey, supra, 13 cal.4th at p. 1082; people v. hill (2005) 131 cal.app.4th 1089, 1102 [defendant did not testify to any apprehension of danger, nor did any other witness testify that defendant appeared to act out of reasonable fear], overruled in part on other grounds in people v. french (2008) 43 cal.4th 36, 48, fn. 5; people v. de leon (1992) 10 cal.app.4th 815, 824 subss honest but unreasonable belief in the 21 necessity to defend . . . may be present without defendant testimony that appellant might have acted in self-defense. gilbert suffered six stab wounds, including the fatal stab wound to the center of his chest. he also suffered blunt force trauma to his head, arms, back, and legs consistent with being kicked or punched. appellant fails to reconcile his theory of self-defense with the compelling evidence that the victim in this case was kicked, punched, and stabbed by multiple assailants. in short, the record is devoid of any substantial evidence to support a self-defense theory, and the trial court properly refused the proffered instructions. request for instruction on voluntary manslaughter. first, there was no evidence whatsoever that gilbert provoked any attack. (see moye, supra, 47 cal.4th at pp. 549 provocation which incites the defendant to homicidal conduct in the heat of passion must be caused by the victim .) the fact that appellant may have learned the identity of a person who stabbed him a year earlier does not constitute provocation by the victim. and even if the alleged stabbing by the victim itself could be deemed adequate provocation, the intervening year was more than sufficient time for any cooling off period. (id if sufficient time has elapsed between the provocation and the fatal blow for passion to subside and reason to return, the killing is not voluntary manslaughter 22 manslaughter. iii. defense closing argument to the jury during deliberations, the jury requested a read-back of the entire defense closing argument. the trial court advised the est on the grounds that statements by the attorneys are not evidence, and reading back only the defense argument would give an unfair advantage to the defense. defense counsel asked the court uest. the court refused and informed the jury it could not read back discretion. we disagree. is governed by section 1138.[8] evidence and instruction on request, but does not extend to people v. gurule (2002) 28 cal.4th 557, 649, quoting people v. pride (1992) 3 cal.4th 195, 266.) our supreme court has held that a trial court has discretion to deny 8 after the jury have retired for deliberation, if there be any disagreement between them as to the testimony, or if they desire to be informed on any point of law arising in the case, they must require the officer to conduct them into court. upon being brought into court, the information required must be given in the presence of, or after notice to, the prosecuting attorney, and the defendant or his counsel, or after they have been called. 23 repeated, and does not abuse that discretion when it refuses such te concern over diverting the pride, supra, at p. 266.) here, the trial court expressed legitimate concern that allowing the jury to rehear only the defense argument would be assertion, this was not a meritless reason, and we find no abuse ground.9 refusal to allow the rereading of the argument deprived him of his constitutional rights to a fair trial and to present a complete defense. during trial, defense counsel took full advantage of the s-examine witnesses, and present the defense theory of the case in 9 the trial court did not share with the jury its concern about the unfairness of repeating only the defense argument, but although the court incorrectly suggested that it lacked authority to order read-back of the argument (see people v. sims (1993) 5 cal.4th 405, 453, overruled on other grounds in people v. storm (2002) 28 cal.4th 1007, 1031-parties constituted a legitimate and appropriate basis for denying 24 people v. gurule, supra, 28 cal.4th at p. 649 [finding no error or - iv. remand is not warranted because the trial sentence itself demonstrate that the trial court would not exercise its new discretion to strike the firearm enhancement appellant contends the case must be remanded for reconsideration of his firearm enhancement pursuant to senate bill no. 620, which gave trial courts discretion to strike firearm enhancements when the law became effective on january 1, 2018. respondent concedes that the new legislation applies retroactively to cases in which judgment is not yet final on appeal.

(a)), because it would require a new sentencing hearing regardless of whether the trial court originally misunderstood the scope of its sentencing discretion and regardless of whether any realistic possibility exists that the trial court would have exercised its discretion to strike one or more qualifying prior convictions. we do not believe that such a remand en masse would represent a wise use of scarce judicial resources.fuhrman, supra, 16 cal.4th at p. 946.) in the present case, imposition of the firearm enhancement pursuant to section 12022.53, subdivisions (a)(1) and (d) resulted 27 lwop sentence on count 1. tromero motion on the grounds that the prior strike conviction pronouncing sentence, the trial court again commented on the coldblooded murder[er]. he killed someone he knew for six ounces of coke. he shot him in the head. it was done in a manner without warning. and he killed mr. jaramillo by stabbing him in the heart after a fight at a party and after mr. jaramillo had been completely disabled. there was no need to carry out the execution of mr. jaramillo. [] . . . [] [appellant] represents, unfortunately, evil that we sometimes have in our society because he kills freely and without consci[ence]. i really, at least from observing him, have not romero motion and its comments prior to imposing sentence, there appears no reasonable likelihood that the trial court would exercise its new discretion under section 12022.53, subdivision (h) to dismiss the accordingly, remand in these circumstances would serve no purpose while representing a squandering of scarce judicial resources. (fuhrman, supra, 16 cal.4th at p. 946.) 28 v. presentence custody credit appellant received 946 days of presentence custody credits based on his actual days in custody. appellant contends he should be awarded an additional 366 days of presentence credit for a total of 1,312 days of presentence custody credit. we agree. actual custody credits are calculated as follows: credit is given for the day of arrest, the day of sentencing, and all days in custody in between. (people v. lopez (1992) 11 cal.app.4th 1115, 1124.) partial days are counted as full days. (in re jackson (1986) 182 cal.app.3d 439, 442443.) a review of the record in this case reveals that appellant was arrested on march 26, 2013, and sentenced on october 27, 2016, and thus served 1,312 days in actual presentence custody. as a general rule, a defendant is supposed to have the trial court correct a miscalculation of presentence custody credits. [citation.] however, ifas herethere are other appellate 29 issues to be decided, the appellate court may simply resolve the custody credits issue in the interests of economy. (people v. acosta (1996) 48 cal.app.4th 411, 427people v. jones (2000) 82 cal.app.4th 485, 493.) appellant is entitled to an additional award of 366 days of presentence credit for a total of 1,312 days of presentence custody credit. disposition the matter is remanded to the trial court with orders to correct the presentence custody credit to 1,312 days, prepare a new abstract of judgment, and forward the same to the california department of corrections and rehabilitation. in all other respects, the judgment is affirmed. not to be published. lui, p. j. we concur: ashmann-gerst, j. hoffstadt, j.
