(a)(1)). he was sentenced to 40 years to life. he argues on appeal that the trial court erred in discharging a juror during deliberations for refusal to deliberate and to follow the law. we agree and reverse. factual and procedural background 1. the events of september 28, 2013 on the morning of september 28, 2013, tritia woo, an occupational therapist, entered a hospital break room at the ronald reagan medical center at ucla. inside the break room, she saw an african-american man without a badge or uniform. he said, ghdemetrios wilson, a physical therapist, if a new therapist had been hired as there was an unknown man in the break room. wilson said no and went to investigate. as wilson approached the break room, he saw defendant, a 58-year-old african-american man, w defendant replied that he was looking for the bathroom. wilson then asked defendant to accompany him to security. defendant initially agreed but then walked out of the building. wilson w defendant eventually offered to let wilson look in his backpack. wilson saw scrubs and a fleece that appeared identical to the uniforms worn at the medical center. witnesses diverged in their accounts of subsequent events. wilson testified that he tackled defendant after defendant hit him in the head with a nail puller.2 however, a 1 all further statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise stated. 2 -webster dictionary <http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/nail %20puller> [as of june 15, 2016].) 3 the bystander then saw defendant swinging wilson and defendant wrestled on the ground. defendant, rendering him unconscious. campus security arrived and asked wilson to get off of defendant. defendant revived and was taken to the hospital for medical treatment. he was charged with robbery and assault with a deadly weapon. the case was called for trial on august 21, 2014. 2. voir dire juror no. 12 was asked about his prior jury experience. he stated that he had been sworn as an alternate in a double murder case that resulted in a hung jury. he did not serve on the jury and did not have an opinion as to the outcome reached. 3. the removal of juror no. 12 and the guilty verdict the presentation of evidence took place over three days and took approximately eight hours. jury deliberations began at 9:05 a.m. on august 29, 2014. at 1:52 p.m., the court received a note from the jury panel stating, decision? the court then instructed the jury to continue deliberations according to calcrim no. 3551: ons: [] . . . each of you must decide the case for yourself and form your individual opinion after you have fully and completely considered all of the evidence with your fellow jurors. [] it is your duty as jurors to deliberate with the goal of reaching a verdict if you can do so without surrendering your individual judgment. do not change your position just because it at 2:14 p.m., the jury resumed deliberations. at 3:26 p.m., the court received a second note from the jury. the note stated, the entire jury is not at a standstill. there are eleven jurors who have all decided on a verdict. only one juror refuses to have a discussion and share his opinion on the 4 additional instructions will not lead us to open discussion. he has no questions that require further validation. the court brought the foreperson (juror no. 10) into open court. juror no. 10 identified the holdout as juror no. 12. juror no. 10 explained that juror no. formulated an opinion and sort of rforth . . . .

[] . . . [] the court has instructed the jurors that they must view the evidence and apply ng bullied to chang[e] his interrupting him. [] . . . he has deliberated. and to remove him would deny my client a the following colloquy ensued: the courhere the defendant, mr. lewis, is african-american, juror no. 12 is african-american. and among the 11 jurors who agree that the defendant was engaging in this conduct were e counsel]: the defendant? three african american jurors. they . . . agreed with the statement made by the foreperson. they all agreed and had . . . very similar explanations.

[i]n retrospect this could be to some extent evidence of a hidden agenda. [] under people [v.] barnwell (2007)] 41 cal.4th 1038 [(barnwell)], i can rely on he has an agenda, i think is speculation. . . . [] . . . [] a double homicide. however, he was an alternate. . . . the court then delivered a lengthy oral ruling. we quote part of it: [t]alking about the evidence but never discussing the conclusion and failing to move 9 forward towards one verdict or another is not deliberating. [] permissible is [to refuse] to discuss the conclusion, to refuse to discuss the verdict, to [] at some point juror no. 12 stopped talking entirely by his own admission, and he claims this was just . . . the 15 minutes before i talked with them. [] earlier in the afternoon . . . . [] purportedly he agrees to the facts, he agrees to the law, or even if they deliberate. i believe this juror pretended to deliberate, he was never open-minded, he never would have changed his mind, the only possible outcome for him would be for the others to agree with him. [] . . . [] and this is not a case where someone deliberates and then stops deliberating when others disagree with him as in people v. castorena,3 it does appear instead that this man came in here with an agenda. . . . [] . . . [] note that failure to follow the law is juror misconduct under barnwell[, supra,] 41 cal.4th 1038, and [people v.] williams [(2001)] 25 cal.4th 441. [] in williams a juror admitted this. here instead more like barnwell s an alternate on a hung jury[] [s]o to say that he had an agenda without pointing to one demonstrable the court responded that 3 people v. castorena (1996) 47 cal.app.4th 1051 (holding the trial court abused its upon which to decide whether [the discharged juror] in fact failed to carry out her duty as a juror to deliberate or wh 10 [a]nd the evidence of the agenda is just the an alternate juror and instructed the jury to begin its deliberations anew. one hour later, the jury found the defendant guilty as charged. defendant was sentenced to state prison for 40 years to life. he filed a timely notice of appeal. contention defendant contends the trial court removed juror no. 12 without good cause. discussion 1. applicable law a. standard of review art. i,  16.). . . . among the essential elements of the right to trial by jury are the requirements that a jury in a felony prosecution consist of 12 persons and that its verdict people v. collins (1976) 17 cal.3d 687, 692693.) submission of the case to the jury, a juror dies or becomes ill, or upon other good cause shown to the court is found to be unable to perform his or her duty, or if a juror requests a discharge and good cause appears therefor, the court may order the juror to be discharged and draw the name of an alternate, who shall then take a place in the jury box, and be subject to the same rules and regulations as though the alternate juror had been selected unanimous jury decision. in light of this constitutional dimension to the problem, it is 11 inappropriate to commit to the trial courtsubject only to the deferential abuse-of-discretion standard of review on appealthe important question of the substitution of jurors after people v. cleveland (2001) 25 cal.4th 466, 487 (cleveland) (conc. opn. of werdegar, j.).) to discharge a juror and order an alternate to serve . . .

[] in reaching that conclusion, the reviewing panel will consider not just the evidence itself, but also the record of r (barnwell, supra, 41 cal.4th at pp. 10521053.) b. a juror may be discharged for misconduct including failure to deliberate deliberate, o12 meaning of . . .

[he] participated in deliberations, attempting to explain, however inarticulately, the basis for his conclusion that the evidence was insufficient to prove an attempted robbery, and he listened, even if id. at pp. 485-486.) in people v. thomas (1994) 26 cal.app.4th 1328, by contrast, the court of appeal upheld the dismissal of a juror who refused to deliberate. the court stated did not answer the questions posed to him by other jurors, did not sit at the table with the other jurors during deliberations, acted as if he had already made up his mind before hearing the whole case, and did not look at the two victims in the courtroom. as the (cleveland, supra, 25 cal.4th at p. 475, citing people v. thomas, supra, 26 cal.app.4th at p. 1333.) c. refusal to apply the law is also jury misconduct . . .

[] [he said, you know, this is where i stand. the trial court did statements or among the jurors; nor did the trial court indicate that it found some jurors credible over other jurors. rather, the trial court stated it found credible all the jurors except juror no. 12, . . . the reviewing court must be the court actually barnwell, supra, 41 cal.4th at p. 1053.) here, the trial court 16 discussed his conclusions with the other members of the jury. the evidence does not in addition, as in cleveland, it was clear from the beginning of discussion with jurors that juror no. 12 was a holdout. (see also people v. karapetyan (2003) 106 cal.app.4th 609, 621 [holding the trial court erred in discharging a juror for failure thand only one juror was at odds. even the trial court acknowledged that juror no. 12 had a different view than the other jurors.

(see cleveland, supra.) while the court questioned each juror about whether juror no. 12 had participated adequately in deliberations, the court did not ask the jurors whether juror no. 12 had refused to apply the law to the facts or failed to follow the law. as the great majority of the jurors did not address the issue, and the two jurors that did address the issue did not 20 set forth a clear view that juror no. 12 refused to follow the law, the record does not reflect a demonstrable reality in support of this conclusion. 3. the judgment must be reversed as the record does not failed to deliberate or refused to follow the law, the trial court abused its discretion in discharging juror no. 12. this error is prejudicial and requires reversal of the judgment. (see cleveland, supra, 25 cal.4th at p. 486, citing people v. hamilton, supra, 60 cal.2d at p. 128 [juror] was inclined toward one side, the error in removing such a juror would be prejudiciapeople v. delamora (1996) 48 cal.app.4th 1850, 1856 [error in removing jurors was prejudicial where the jury was deadlocked prior to removal but quickly reached verdict to convict after substitution with alternate jurors].) disposition the judgment is reversed and the matter remanded for a new trial. not to be published in the official reports edmon, p. j. we concur: aldrich, j. hogue, j.* * judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
