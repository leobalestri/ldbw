(b)). the trial court sentenced mackey to an aggregate state prison term of 70 years to life: on count 2, the court imposed an indeterminate term of 25 years to life for the robbery of qumsieh, plus 10 years for the two five-year enhancements pursuant to section 667, subdivision (a)(1); on count 3, the court imposed a consecutive term of 25 years to life for the robbery of rosas, plus 10 years for the two five-year enhancements. the court stayed sentence on count 1, the robbery of bank of america, and on the two one-year prior prison term enhancements. 2 prior to being questioned, mackey was advised of his right to remain silent, to the presence of an attorney and, if indigent, to appointed counsel. (miranda v. arizona (1966) 384 u.s. 436 [16 l.ed.2d 694, 86 s.ct. 1602].) mackey does not challenge the admission of his statements in this appeal. 3 the sole evidence mackey introduced was a photograph of him taken after his arrest. 4 discussion 1. the motion to suppress was properly denied a. the suppression hearing prior to trial, mackey filed a motion to suppress the evidence that had been seized from his car, asserting an improper warrantless search. (pen. code, 1538.5.) at the suppression hearing, detective kevin forcier, assigned to investigate the robberies, testified he had encountered the electronic tracking device used by the newhall bank of america on 30 to 40 occasions in his law enforcement career. forcier explained when alerts the desk personnel that the device is tbroadcast this information to the deputies in the field. dispatch of the bank of america robbery. according to early reports from either the robbery victims or informants, the suspect was an african american man wearing a black sweatshirt and driving a white ford explorer. a later report placed the suspect in a red ford mustang. aguilera began driving to the bank of america, but changed direction when advised by radio dispatch that an electronic tracking device was transmitting its speed and course of travel. aguilera started following the route of location. he drove on surface streets and then entered the antelope valley freeway going north. when aguilera was near the sand canyon exit at approximately 10:53 a.m., c stop, where another deputy had pulled over the red toyota camry driven by mackey. at that point, aguilera heard an update 5 removed from the car and arrested. inside the camry aguilera saw, in plain view, the bag of money, handgun, gloves and hooded sweater. a further search followed. mackey did not testify at the suppression hearing. following argument by counsel, the trial court denied the suppression motion, concluding the deputies had reasonable suspicion to detain mackey in light of the electronic tracking device information upon which they reasonably relied. b. standard of review in reviewing the denial of a motion to suppress evidence, we defer to the trial s factual findings, express or implied, when supported by substantial evidence. (people v. tully (2012) 54 cal.4th 952, 979.) the power to judge credibility, weigh evidence and draw factual inferences is vested in the trial court. (ibid.) however, in determining whether, on the facts found, the search or seizure was reasonable under the fourth amendment, we exercise our independent judgment. (ibid., people v. lomax (2010) 49 cal.4th 530, 563.) whether relevant evidence obtained by assertedly unlawful means must be excluded is determined exclusively by deciding whether its suppression is mandated by the federal constitution. (cal. const. art. i,  28, subd. (f)(2); see people v schmitz (2012) 55 cal.4th 909, 916.) c. the requirement of reasonable suspicion for a detention a detention occurs within the meaning of the fourth amendment when a law enforcement officer, by means of physical force or show of authority, in some manner brendlin v. california (2007) 551 u.s. 249, 254 [168 l.ed.2d 132, 127 s.ct. 2400]; people v. zamudio (2008) 43 cal.4th 327, 341.) the officer may detain the person only if the officer has a reasonable, articulable suspicion the detainee has been, currently is or is about to be engaged in criminal activity. (terry v. ohio (1968) 392 u.s. 1..21 [20 l.ed.2d 889, 88 s.ct. 1868]; see in re tony c. specific articulable facts that, considered in light of the totality of the circumstances, provide some objective manifestation that the person detained may be involved in 6 people v. souza (1994) 9 cal.4th 224, 231; united states v. sokolow (1989) 490 u.s. 1, 7 [104 l.ed.2d 1, 109 s.ct. 1581].) in evaluating whether that (united states v. cortez (1981) 449 u.s. 411, 417 [66 l.ed.2d 621, 101 s.ct. 690].) d. by reasonable suspicion the detention of mackey, his subsequent arrest and search of his car were lawful only if the deputies had a reasonable, articulable suspicion that mackey was involved in criminal activity. mackey contends because the people failed to prove the electronic tracking device was functioning properly and thus reliable on the day of the bank robbery, the deputies otherwise had only a generalized description of the suspect and the it is true a vague or general description, standing alone, does not furnish reasonable grounds to detain any individual who falls within that description. (see in re tony c., supra, 21 cal.3d, 888--old burglary report insufficient to justify detention of two african-american teenagers in vicinity of crimes]; people v collins (1970) 1 cal.3d 658, 660-661 [doubtrace, height and weight failed to distinguish him from substantial portion of local population].) here, however, mackey concedes he was not detained merely because he met the generalized description of the robbery suspectan african american man driving a red the robberies 18 minutes earlier, he triggered an electronic tracking device that was now then radioed to the pursuing deputies every few seconds. aguilera testified he relied on nearby surface streets and then onto the freeway. shortly after aguilera entered the freeway, the tracking 7 immediately thereafter, aguilera came upon a traffic stop involving mackey, who had been pulled over by another deputy. the fact that the tracking device led the deputies to mackey, who matched the description of the suspect, was sufficient basis for his detention.4 ent in this case to demonstrate that the electronic tracking device was accepted in the scientific community and functioning accurately and properly on the day of the robberies. because the test under these circumstances is whether the deputies reasonably relied on the information to device was essentially the equivalent of an untested confidential informant and its transmissions were akin to an unsubstantiated tip. the motion to suppress was properly denied. 2. evidentiary issues during an evidentiary hearing, kelly/fryebe admitted into evidence. the trial court rejected the request. during trial, and over these references arguing there was no showing the tracking device was accurate and 4 appellant states in his opening brief on appeal, provided : eputies relied on the tracking information location and speed updates to locate, detain, and arrest appellant. 8 reliable under evidence code sections 402 and 403 and the kelly/frye test.5 he also even were the kelly test applicable to this device, which we doubt, the scientific basis for, and reliability of, the device are not at issue. the police stopped mackey, and then confirmed their suspicion that he was the suspect with information indicating the device showed he had stopped at the location the device indicated. to the extent the prosecution relied on the tracking device, it was solely as circumstantial evidence of dentity as the robbery suspect, by demonstrating the same device that was 6 testimony thecamry. 3. the conviction for the robbery of the bank of america (count 1) is reversed mackey argues, and the people concede, the robbery conviction as charged in count 1 must be reversed because the named victim was the bank of america. unlike the bank tellers qumsieh and rosas, who were the named robbery victims in counts 2 and 3, respectively, the bank cannot be a victim of a robbery as a matter of law. it is not a person within the meaning of penal code section 211, which defines robbery as 5 people v. kelly (1976) 17 cal.3d 24 (kelly); frye v. united states (d.c. cir. 1923) 293 f. 1013, 1014 (frye). however, in people v. soto (1999) 21 cal.4th 512, 515, footnote 3, the california supreme court explained that as frye had been supplanted in federal jurisprudence, the foundational test formerly referred to as the kelly/frye test is now referred to as the kelly test. 6 bag of stolen money before the suspect fled from the bank. police officers then detain a motorist and retrieve from the car a bag containing money and a blue rock. that it was the same blue rock that the teller had placed inside the bag of money is circumstantial 9 committed against a person. (see people v. ugalino (2009) 174 cal.app.4th 1060, 1064; people v. jordan (1984) 155 cal.app.3d 769, 782.) the verdict as to count 1 is reversed. 4. the trial court erroneously imposed separate serious felony enhancements the trial court imposed two five-year enhancements under penal code section 667, subdivision (a)(1) after finding mackey had suffered serious felony convictions for robbery and burglary on november 25, 2008 in los angeles superior court case number ma042066. the court imposed and stayed two one-year prior prison term enhancements under penal code section 667.5, subdivision (b) based on the same two convictions. mackey argues, and the people concede, the two prior convictions alleged pursuant to penal code section 667, subdivision (a)(1) cannot support separate enhancements because they were the result of a single prior proceeding. we agree. ]ny person convicted of a serious felony who previously has been convicted of a serious felony . . . shall receive, in addition to the sentence imposed by the court for the present offense, a five-year enhancement for each such prior conviction on charges in re harris (1989) 49 cal.3d 131, 136; people v. frausto (2009) 180 cal.app.4tfelony convictions for robbery and burglary were brought and tried together in the same proceeding, the court erred in imposing more than one five-year enhancement under penal code section 667, subdivision (a)(1). where, as here, two prior serious felony convictions cannot support separate five-year enhancements, one conviction can be the basis for a five-year enhancement under section 667, subdivision (a)(1) and the other can be the basis for a one-year enhancement under penal code section 667.5, subdivision (b). (people v. jones (1993) 5 cal.4th 1142, 1152-1153.) 10 disposition the conviction for count 1, the robbery of the bank of america, is reversed. the sentence is vacated and the cause remanded for a new sentencing hearing consistent with this opinion. in all other respects the judgment is affirmed. zelon, acting p. j. we concur: segal, j. beckloff, j. judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
