(a)(1), now  245, subd. (a)(4); counts 1 and 4); assault with a deadly weapon, a knife (id.,  245, subd. (a)(1); count 2); and making a terrorist threat (now making a criminal threat, see people v. moore (2004) 118 cal.app.4th 74, 78-79) ( 422; count 3). the people alleged braziel had two prior convictions for serious or violent felonies ( 667, subds. (b)-(i), 1170.12, subds. (a)-(d)) and five prior convictions for which he served prison terms ( 667.5, subd. (b)). on august 4, 1999 the jury found braziel guilty on counts 1, 2, and 3 and found true all prior conviction allegations. the trial court sentenced braziel under the three strikes law to a prison term of 25 years to life on each count. the court ordered braziel to serve the sentences on counts 1 and 3 concurrently and stayed execution of sentence on count 2 pursuant to section 654. the court also imposed a term of four years under section 667.5, subdivision (b), for a total prison term of 29 years to life. this court affirmed. (people v. braziel (july 18, 2000, b136493) [nonpub. opn.] (braziel i).) on may 7, 2013 braziel filed a petition for recall of his sentence pursuant to section 1170.126. the trial court denied his petition on the ground that one of his current offenses, making a criminal threat, was a serious felony under section 1192.7, subdivision (c)(38), making him ineligible for resentencing. braziel filed a notice of appeal, which we deemed a petition for writ of mandate and denied. (people v. braziel (april 9, 2014, b249830) [nonpub. opn.] (braziel ii).) braziel filed a petition for 4 review, which the supreme court granted. the supreme court transferred the matter to this court for reconsideration in light of johnson. on remand from the supreme court we evaluated each of -by-count basis. (people v. braziel (march 1, 2016, b249830) [nonpub. opn.] (braziel iii).) we held bodily injury may or may not be a serious or violent felony, depending on whether braziel actually inflicted great bodily injury on his victim. (ibid.; see  667.5, subd. (c)(8), 1192.7, subd. (c)(8); people v. delgado (2008) 43 cal.4th 1059, 1065 means likely to produce [great bodily injury], without the additional element of personal infliction, is not people v. fox (2014) 224 we stated that the people did not allege, and the jury did not find, braziel actually inflicted great bodily injury, but that the court could review the record of conviction to determine whether braziel personally inflicted great bodily injury. (braziel iii, at p. 4; see people v. cook (2017) 8 cal.app.5th 309, 315; people v. johnson (2016) 1 cal.app.5th 953, 966, fn. 12.) we directed the superior court to review the record of conviction to determine whether braziel inflicted great bodily injury and whether therefore he is ineligible for resentencing on his conviction for assault by means likely to produce great bodily injury. (braziel iii, at p. 5.) the superior court held a hearing on resentencing on his conviction for assault by means likely to 5 produce great bodily injury. applying a preponderance of the evidence standard, the court found braziel intended to, and did, cause great bodily injury. the court therefore ruled braziel was not eligible for resentencing under section 1170.126. braziel timely appealed. discussion a. applicable law a defendant whose current offense is assault by means likely to produce great bodily injury may be ineligible for resentencing under section 1170.126 in at least two different ways. first, if the conviction is a serious or violent felony under section 667.5, subdivision (c), or section 1192.7, subdivision (c), the defendant may not file a petition for recall of sentence under proposition 36. (see  1170.126, subd. (b).) as we stated in braziel iii, assault by means likely to produce great bodily injury is a serious felony if the defendant personally inflicted great bodily injury on the victim. thus, if braziel inflicted great bodily injury on his victim, his conviction for assault by means likely to inflict great bodily injury is a serious or violent felony and he is not eligible for resentencing under section 1170.126. second, even if the defendant did not inflict great bodily injury, section 1170.126, subdivision (e)(2), provides that the defendant is not eligible for resentencing under proposition 36 if urrent sentence was imposed for any of the offenses appearing in clauses (i) to (iii), inclusive, of subparagraph (c) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (e) of section 667 or clauses (i) to (iii), inclusive, of subparagraph (c) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (c) of section 1170.12 6 the defendant used a firearm, was armed with a firearm or deadly weapon, or intended to cause great bodily injury to another personthus, if braziel intended to inflict great bodily injury on his victim, he is not eligible for resentencing under section 1170.126. (see people v. frierson (2017) 4 cal.5th 225, 234 [the people can r that the defendant intended to cause great bodily injury].) as stated, the trial court ruled braziel was not entitled to relief for both of these reasons. the trial court found the injuries substantial. the court stated that all four individuals who and facial swelling. these injuries are sufficient for a finding of gcommission of the offense, [braziel] grabbed williams and slapped her. [braziel] chased williams after she managed to get away, caught her, and began to beat her with both of his fists. williams fell to the ground and [braziel] kicked her in the head, back and the side of her stomach. [braziel] then stabbed at her approximately ten times with a knife. williams ran into [a use for safety. [braziel] forced his way inside the house, caught williams, straddled her, and punched her with both fists and kicked her in the stomach. [braziel] continued to the court finds that [braziel] did intend to cause 7 great bodily injury to williams in the commission of the offense of b. the trial court applied what turned out to be the wrong legal standard at thintermediate appellate authority on whether the standard of proof for determining whether a defendant is eligible for resentencing under proposition 36 was preponderance of the evidence or beyond a reasonable doubt. in people v. frierson, supra, 4 cal.5th 225 the supreme court resolved that split of authority and held that the people have the burden of establishing a petitioner is ineligible for resentencing beyond a reasonable doubt. (id. at pp. 229, 240; accord, people v. piper (2018) 25 cal.app.5th 1007, 1014; see people v. perez (2018) 4 cal.5th 1055, 1062 once an inmate has made an initial showing of eligibility for resentencing, the burden is on the prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that one of the grounds for ineligibility appliesuse the preponderance of the evidence standard to find braziel was not eligible for resentencing under proposition 36 on his conviction for assault by means likely to inflict great bodily injury was, we now know, erroneous. 8 c. in a postconviction he or she is not constitutionally ent (people v. esparza (2015) 242 cal.app.4th 726, 740in people v. frierson that the proper standard of proof is beyond a reasonable doubt was based on an interpretation of state law and the structure and language of proposition 36. (people v. frierson, supra, 4 cal.5th at pp. 235-239.) therefore, we apply the harmless error standard in people v. watson (1956) 46 cal.2d 818, 836 (watson). (cf. people v. johnson, supra, 1 cal.app.5th at p. 968 [watson harmless error sts error on a defendans resentencing petition under proposition 47].) under watson result was reasonably probable . . . people v. gonzalez (2018) 5 cal.5th 186, 201; see people v. mendoza (2016) 62 cal.4th 856, 902 [under watsonreasonably probable a result more favorable to the defendant would have been reached in the absence of the error].) braziel did not meet his burden of showing there is a reasonable probability the court would have granted braziel relief under proposition 36 even if the court had applied a beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard. the evidence in the record shows beyond a reasonable doubt that braziel inflicted great bodiwilliams had bruises on her face and cheek, swelling by her nose, her back. (see people v. escobar (1992) 3 cal.4th 740, 752 [multiple abrasions back and 9 bruising of the eye and cheek [has been] found to be great bodily injurypeople v. odom (2016) 244 cal.app.4th 237, 247 brasions, lacerations and bruising can constitute great bodily injurypeople v. washington (2012) 210 cal.app.4th 1042, 1047 some physical pain or damage, such as lacerations, bruises, or abrasions is sufficient for a finding of great bodily injury].) williams also suffered headaches and permanent scarring. the record also shows beyond a reasonable doubt that braziel intended to inflict great bodily injury on williams, indeed that he intended to inflict even greater bodily injury than he was able to inflict. braziel chased williams, beat her with his hands, and kicked her multiple times, even after she fell to the ground. one witness testified braziel hit williams approximately curled up on the ground, braziel repeatedly lunged at williams with a pocketknife and stabbed her ten times in her side, lower not more severe was that the knife braziel was using was too dull to penetrate her skin more than once. (see people v. phillips (1989) 208 cal.app.3d 1120, 1124 ntent to inflict [great bodily] injury may be shown by, and inferred from, the circumstances surrounding the doing of the act itself 10 disposition the order is affirmed. segal, j. we concur: perluss, p.j. zelon, j.
