(a))1; (2) being a felon in possession of a loaded firearm ( 25850, subd. (a)); and (3) being a felon in possession of a firearm ( 29800, subd. (a)(1)). as to the second incident, he was charged with (1) assaulting maldonado with a firearm ( 245, subd. (a)(2)), (2) assaulting maldonado with a semi-automatic firearm ( 245, subd. (b)), and (3) being a felon in possession of a firearm ( 29800, subd. (a)(1)). as to the third incident, he was charged with being a felon in 1 all further statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise indicated. 3 possession of a firearm ( 29800, subd. (a)(1)). the people also alleged a number of enhancements, including (1) that the two assaults were committed for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with a criminal street gang ( 186.22, subd. (b)(1)(b)), (2) that defendant personally used a firearm in the assaults ( 12022.5, subd. (a)), (3) that defendant was on bail while committing the assaults ( 12022.1), (4) that defendant had ( 1170.12, subds. (a)-(d), 667, subds. (b)-(i)), and (5) that defendant had two prior 667, subd. (a)(1)). during trial, the people voluntarily dismissed the felon in possession of a loaded firearm charge from the first incident, as well as the enhancements for gang involvement and personal use of a firearm as to the felon in possession charges from the second and third incidents. after the jury convicted defendant of all remaining counts and found all allegations to be true, the trial court sentenced defendant to prison for 40 years and eight months. three prior base sentence, for the assault on maldonado with a semi-automatic firearm (nine years, doubled due to the remaining ntences of three, felony convictions, respectively; (3) a consecutive sentence of 16 months for carrying a concealed firearm in a vehicle (one-third the middle term of 24 months, doubled due to a consecutive sentence of 16 months for being a felon in possession in the third incident (one-third the middle term of 24 months, doubled section 654, sentences of two years and three years for the felon in possession and assault with a firearm convictions arising out of the second incident, and a sentence of two years for being a felon in possession of a firearm arising out of the first incident. defendant timely appeals. 4 discussion that he committed the assault with a semi-subd. (b)(1)(b).) more specifically, defendant asserts that the people did not adduce qualify, the people must prove (1) that osl is an organization, association or group of three or more persons sharing a common name or identifying sign or symbol, (2) that one qualifying crimes listed in section 186.22, subd. (e), collectively engage in a pattern of criminal gang activity. ( 186.22, subd. (f); people v. duran (2002) 97 cal.app.4th 1448, 1457 (duran).) defendant argues that the people primary activities was the commission of statutorily enumerated (that is, qualifying) crimes. for the commission of qualifying crimes tthe commission of those crimes people v. sengpadychith (2001) 26 cal.4th 316, 323 (sengpadychith).) put differently, the people must ose crimes. (id. ose crimes is not enough. (in re alexander l. (2007) 149 cal.app.4th 605, 611 (alexander l.); duran, supra, 97 cal.app.4th at p. 1465.) there one of its 1) the people can prove that individual gang members have consistently and repeatedly committed qualifying crimes (people v. vy (2004) 122 cal.app.4th 1209, 1225-1226 [commission of three crimes by a small gang during a three-month period; sufficient]; cf. in re jorge g. (2004) 117 cal.app.4th 931, 945 [commission of a single crime; insufficient]; people v. perez (2004) 118 cal.app.4th 151, 160 [commission of three qualifying crimes, including the charged crime, within one 5 week as well as another qualifying crime six years earlier; insufficient]), and the tally offense (duran, at p. 1465); (2) intimidate, and that gang members have committed qualifying crimes to create such fear and intimidation (ibid.); or (3) a gang expert can offer activities (people v. gardeley (1996) 14 cal.4th 605, 620; sengpadychith, at p. 329; people v. martinez (2008) 158 cal.app.4th 1324, 1330). in evaluating whether the people in this case have adduced sufficient evidence that qualifying offenses, our task is to assess whether the evidence is sufficient to enable a rational trier of fact to find this element beyond a reasonable doubt. (people v. rios (2013) 222 cal.app.4th 542, 559.) in evaluating the evidence, we are required all of the evidencetrial. (people v. miranda (2011) 199 cal.app.4th 1403, 1412.) we are to view that ll reasonable inferences in favor of that finding. (rios, at p. 564.) in this case, the people introduced evidence that osl gang members have los angeles county tigator sergio reyes, testified that he had investigated several burglaries, carjackings, assaults with deadly weapons, petty thefts, and attempted murders. except for petty theft, all of these crimes are qualifying offenses. ( 186.22, subds. (e)(2) [robbery], (e)(4) [sale of controlled substances], (e)(11) [burglary], (e)(21) [carjacking], (e)(1) [assault with a deadly weapon], (e)(3) [murder, including attempted murder].) the people also introduced evidence that an osl gang member had committed a burglary in 2012, that another osl member had committed an unlawful taking or driving of a vehicle in 2013 ( 186.22, subd. (e)(25) [unlawful taking; qualifying offense]), and that defendant had committed the charged assault with a deadly weapon in 20136 is enhanced through their commission of acts of violence. robberies, carjackings, assaults with a deadly weapon and attempted murders are, by definition, acts of violence. ( 211, 459, 245, 187, 664.) the expert based his opinions on his 14 years as a sworn peace officer, the courses on gangs he has attended or facilitated, his conversations with gang members (including osl gang members), his investigation of gang crimes (including crimes by osl gang members), and his prior testimony as a gang expert. under the authority discussed above, the above-enumerated evidence is more than commission of qualifying offenses. indeed, defendant never disputed it at trial. during his closing argument to the jury, defendant ies; instead of arguing that osl was not a criminal street gang, he argued that the charged defendant nevertheless raises two challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence on appealmembers is entitled to little weight because the expert was never asked whetherand did not testify thatthey were one of primary activities. we disagree that the answer is dispositive. juries may draw reasonable inferences from the evidence presented (and, on review, we are required to presume they did (people v. whalen (2013) 56 cal.4th 1, 56, fn. 22)), and a jury can reasonably infer that the long list of qualifying their commission thereby constitute, people v. margarejo (2008) 162 cal.app.4th 102, 106-ry activities].) second, defendant contends that this case is indistinguishable from alexander l., supra, 149 cal.app.4th 605, which overturned a gang enhancement for insufficient 7 alexander l. is either analogous or dispositive. in alexander l., the gang expert opined that the gang members quite a few assaults with a deadly weapon,been involved in murders.id. at pp. 611-612, 614.) the court expressed doubt as to whether this evidence was sufficient by itself to prove that the uate foundation in light ibid.) in this case, however, expertise detailed above, no basis to challenge those qualifications. further, the evidence that osl gang h committing violent crimes and evidence that osl members had committed several such crimes. our analysis is not, as defendant suggests, affected by the erroneous gang enhancement jury instruction given the in this case. that instruction properly informed act gle offense was erroneous because evidence of any qualifying offense committed by gang members sengpadychith, supra, 26 cal.4th at p. 323), and because the people had introduced evidence that osl members had committed several qualifying offenses in addition to assaults with a deadly weapon. this instructional error does not affect our substantial evidence review for two reasons. first, as noted above, we are charged presented at trial. (miranda, supra, 199 cal.app.4th at p. 1412.) second, the chief limitation to the consideration of all evidence in a substantial evidence challengerecognized in people v. kunkin (1973) 9 cal.3d 245 (kunkin) and 8 people v. smith (1984) 155 cal.app.3d 1103 (smith)does not apply here. in kunkin and smith, the people urged the courts to reject substantial evidence challenges to theft convictions on theories of theft (having completely different elements) that were never presented to the jurytheories not before the jury in seeking to reconcile a jury verdict with the substantial kunkin, at pp. 250-251 [jury instructed on theft by larceny; appellate court may not affirm on theory of theft by embezzlement]; smith, at p. 1145 [jury instructed on theft by embezzlement; appellate court may not affirm on other theft theories].) the rule announced in kunkin and smith is not applicable when an erroneous jury instruction mistakenly narrows what evidence a jury can consider as to a single element (or a sub-element) of a crime or enhancement. (but see people v. garcia (2014) 224 cal.app.4th 519, 525 [applying kunkin and smith to an instruction that unnecessarily narrowed what the jury could consider as evidence to support one element of a gang enhancement].) when the instructional error pertains to a single element (or sub-element) of a crime or enhancement, there is no danger of a directed verdict of guilt as to all of the elements of a crime, as there was in kunkin and smith. moreover, extending kunkin and smith to this new context would place them in tension (if not outright conflict) with more recent cases from the united states and california supreme courts holding that instructional error involving the omission or misdescription of one or more elements of a ccan be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. (neder v. united states (1999) 527 u.s. 1, 10, 17; people v. cummings (1993) 4 cal.4th 1233, 1315.) these newer cases contemplate that an appellate court may affirm a conviction based on overwhelming evidence presented at trial (which renders the error harmless beyond a reasonable doubt), even where the jury never actually considered whether that evidence established the omitted or misdescribed element. under this reasoning, an appellate court is also empowered to ignore an impermissibly restrictive jury instruction as to an element and to 9 conduct a substantial evidence review based on all of the evidence, even though the jury did not. if this were not the case, the label we attach to the same errorinstructional versus insufficient evidencecould lead to diametrically opposed outcomes (affirmance in the former if the instructional error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, but automati(people v. superior court (pearson) (2010) 48 cal.4th 564, 573), we conclude that the erroneous instruction does not limit the scope of our substantial evidence analysis.2 for these reasons, we conclude that the evidence was sufficient to sustain the gang enhancement as to the assault with the semi-automatic firearm count. disposition the judgment of conviction is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. _______________________, j. hoffstadt we concur: ____________________________, p. j. boren ____________________________, j. chavez 2 the instructional error is also not an independent ground for reversal. as neder, supra, 527 u.s. at p. 17.) here, as noted above, the primary activity element was not the subject of questioning or argument, and for that reason was uncontested; the evidence was also overwhelming.
