(b)). this issue is pending before our supreme court,2 but every decision people v. jones (2016) 1 cal.app.5th 221, 230, review granted sept. 14, 2016, s235901 (jones).) we do the same, and affirm. facts and procedural background in 1992, defendant was convicted of receiving stolen property. in 2009, defendant was convicted by plea of making criminal threats. ( 422.)3 as part of his plea deal, he admitted three prior felony convictions for which he served time in prison; one of those prior convictions was his 1992 receiving stolen property conviction. the trial court sentenced defendant to nine years in state prison, comprised of six years for the criminal threats count and one year for each of the prior prison terms. 1 all further statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise indicated. 2 people v. valenzuela (2016) 244 cal.app.4th 692, review granted march 30, 2016, s232900; people v. ruff (2016) 244 cal.app.4th 935, review granted may 11, 2016, s233201; people v. carrea (2016) 244 cal.app.4th 966, review granted april 27, 2016, s233011; people v. williams (2016) 245 cal.app.4th 458, review granted may 11, 2016, s233539. 3 defendant was also charged with petty theft with a prior ( 666), simple battery ( 242 & 243), and burglary ( 459). those charges were dismissed as part of his plea. 3 in 2015, defendant filed a motion to have his 1992 receiving stolen property conviction redesignated as a misdemeanor pursuant to the newly enacted proposition 47. that motion was granted.4 later that year, defendant filed a motion to have the sentence imposed in the 2009 criminal threats case reduced by one year on the ground that the 1992 prior conviction used as a prior prison term was no longer a felony. the trial court denied demotion. defendant filed this timely appeal.5 defendant concurrently filed a petition for issue, we exercise our discretion and consider the merits of defenhabeas petition together. we dispose of the habeas petition in a separately filed order. discussion defendant argues that proposition 47 renders a felony conviction redesignated 1170.18, subd. (k)), and thereby requires a trial court to reduce sentences imposed for crimes unaffected by proposition 47 4 the trial court originally redesignated a burglary count that had been charged but entered a nunc pro tunc order redesignating the receiving stolen property offense. 5 the people contend that this court lacks jurisdiction on direct appeal to consider , on the grounds that it constitutes an appeal from a nonappealable postjudgment motion to modify a judgment. although this issue is pending before our supreme court (people v. gratton, review granted apr. 27, 2016, s233057), in the interim we conclude that the order denying s motion is appealable aaffecting [his] substantial substanteal v. superior court (2014) 60 cal.4th 595, 600-601 [postjudgment order denying a petition for resentencing under proposition 36 is an appealable order under section 1237, subdivision (b), even if petitioner is not ultimately eligible for resentencing].) in the alternative, we have the discretion to construe s appeal as a petition for a writ of habeas corpus with respect to the 2009 sentence he is still serving, and we exercise that discretion. (people v. segura (2008) 44 cal.4th 921, 928, fn. 4.) 4 if those sentences were enhanced by prior convictions redesignated under the proposition. he also argues that equal protection compels this reading of the statute. questions of statutory interpretation, questions of constitutional law, and questions involving the retroactivity of statutes are all reviewed de novo. (raef v. appellate division of superior court (2015) 240 cal.app.4th 1112, 1120; in re marriage of fellows (2006) 39 cal.4th 179, 183.) - and theft-related 6 (people v. lynall (2015) 233 cal.app.4th 1102, 1108.) proposition 47 entitle a defendant to a reduction in sentences that were enhanced by felonies later redesignated as misdemeanors; and (2) if not, does equal protection compel that result? as we explain below, the answer to both questions is no. i. interpreting proposition 47 although the text of proposition 47 does not directly address whether the redesignation of a felony as a misdemeanor entitles a defendant to seek resentencing in any cases where felony-cum-misdemeanor had been used as an enhancement, the text indirectly dictates that it does not. we reach this conclusion for two reasons. first, proposition 47 expressly spells out two instances in which relief is available: (1) for defendants and obtain a resentencing ( 1170.18, subds. (a) & (b)); and (2) for defendants who have [their] -misdemeanor (id., subds. (f) & (g)). proposition 47 does not provide for resentencing of a felony unaffected by proposition 47 just because a redesignated felony was used as an enhancement. we give this omission conclusive weight because proposition 47 6 the redesignated offenses are defined in sections 459.5, 473, 476a, 490.2, 496 and 666 as well as in health and safety code sections 11350, 11357 and 11377. ( 1170.18, subds. (a) & (b).) 5 elsewid., subd. (n); accord, jones, supra, 1 cal.app.5th at pp. 228-230, review granted.) e nor . . . , the offense thereafter isdemeanor for all purposespeople v. park (2013) 56 cal.4th 782, 795 (park)people v. feyrer (2010) 48 cal.4th 426, 439), but the redesignation . . . people v. moomey (2011) 194 cal.app.4th 850, 857; gebremicael v. california com. on teacher credentialing (2004) 118 cal.app.4th 1477, 1482). because we must generally construe similar language similarly when it arises in a similar context (people v. cornett (2012) 53 cal.4th 1261, 1269, fn. 6)-retroactivity applies with equal force to proposition 47. defendant raises a number of arguments in response. first, he argues that the uncodified portion of information guide, gen. elec. (nov. 4, 2014) text of prop. 47,  15 & 18) and that the purpose of proposition 47 is to stop wasting money on imprisonment for lower level crimes (id.,  2 & 3). neither argument is persuasive. it is well settled that a from the mere fact that the statute is remedial and subject to the rule of liberal di genova v. state board of education (1962) 57 cal.2d 167, 174.) and does not mean that we should interpret the statute in every way that might maximize any people v. morales (2016) 63 cal.4th 399, 408.) second, defendant attempts to distinguish proposition 47 from section 17. proposition 47, he notes, has a single exception to its otherwise global declaration that a redesignated felony is a misdemeanor for all purposes 6 not permit that person to own, possess, or have in his or her custody or control any s governing possession of firearms by prohibited persons. ( 1170.18, subd. (k).) the inclusion of this exception, defendant reasons, precludes all others. we disagree. section 17 also has several exceptions to the effect of redesignation under its auspices (e.g., park, supra, 56 cal.4th at pp. 794-795), and those exceptions have purely prospective application. third, defendant contends that proposition 47 should be construed retroactively under the principles of in re estrada (1965) 63 cal.2d 740 (estrada). estrada erects a criminal offense is intended to apply to all nonpeople v. brown (2012) 54 cal.4th 314, 324 (brown); estrada, at p. 744.) although redesignation of a felony as [es] . . . estrada applies only to ago when the availability for review of that conviction expired. (people v. smith (2015) 234 cal.app.4th 1460, 1464-1465 (smith) [conviction becomes final when time to appeal and file a petition for writ of certiorari expires].)7 fourth, defendant points to cases that he contends dictate a result in his favor notwithstanding the text of proposition 47. specifically, he cites flores, supra, 92 cal.app.3d 461 and in re chavez (2004) 114 cal.app.4th 989, 1000 (chavez). in flores, the defendant sought to overturn a long-final marijuana possession conviction used to enhance a later drug-related conviction on the basis of subsequent legislation that reduced the penalty for marijuana possession crimes and mandated that records of arrests and convictions pertaining to those crimes be destroyed. (flores, at pp. 471-472.) flores 7 although people v. flores (1979) 92 cal.app.3d 461, 470-471 (flores) suggests a different definition of finalityffect of [a] prior conviction is not final as long as the defendant has the right [to] appeal from the enhanced sentenceimposed due to that convictionwe reject that definition as inconsistent with estradas definition. 7 held that the court records be destroyed evinced a clear intent that those recordsand the convictions they recordednot be used to enhance future sentences. (id. at pp. 473-474.) no such clear intent exists with proposition 47. chavez held that a defendant sentenced under our -indeterminate sentencing law and whose conviction had become final was nevertheless entitled to resentencing under the new determinate sentencing law because (1) the legislature had expressed an intent to make the new law retroactive, and (2) equal y new approach to sentencing to final convictions. (chavez, at pp. 991, 1000.) because, as discussed above, proposition 47 lacks indicia of an intent to be applied retroactively and because, as discussed below, proposition 47 does not offend equal protection, chavez is not persuasive. lastly, defendant urges us to apply the rule of lenity and to resolve all doubts in his favor because he is the defendant the rule of lenity is a tie-breaking two reasonable interpretations of the same provision stand in relative equipoise (people v. boyce (2014) 59 cal.4th 672, 695.) it does not apply where, as here, the law is clearly against the defendant. (ibid.) ii. equal protection e provision to apply (chavez, supra, 114 cal.app.4th at p. 1000; see smith, supra, 234 cal.app.4th at pp. 1466-1467.) both the united states and california constitutions guarantee the equal protection of the laws. (u.s. const., 14th amend.,  1; cal. const., art. i,  7; see in re evans clau this guarantee assures that the legislature and voters cannot similarly situated groups in an unequal (brown, supra, 54 at least where, as here, that classification 8 does not involve a suspect class or a fundamental right (people v. singh (2011) 198 cal.app.4th 364, 369). defendant argues that refusing to give a proposition 47 redesignation retroactive effect sets up two classes of defendants: (1) those sentenced in the past, who are unable to avoid enhancements based on prior felony or wobbler convictions (because the redesignations they obtain on those prior convictions do not apply retroactively); and (2) those sentenced now, who are able to avoid enhancements based on prior felony or wobbler convictions (because the redesignations they obtain on those prior convictions apply prospectively). what distinguishes these two classes of defendants is whether the defendants were able to seek redesignation before or after the current sentence was imposed, which in turn is a function of the date proposition 47 took effect. however, it is well settled that a reduction of sentences only prospectively from the date a new (people v. floyd (2003) 31 cal.4th 179, 189; see also smith, supra, 234 cal.app.4th at p. ameliorating punishment for particular offenses may be made prospective only without this makes sense because a classification defined by the date an ameliorative statute takes effect rationally furthers tt by carrying out the original (in re kapperman (1974) 11 cal.3d 542, 546.) we are not alone in our conclusion that the non-retroactivity of proposition 47 complies with equal protection. (accord, jones, supra, 1 cal.app.5th at pp. 230-232, review granted.) iii. conclusion defendant . . . people v. tenner (1993) 6 cal.4th 559, 563), and because the redesignation of a felony under proposition 47 does not operate retroactively, there is no basis to disturb the prior prison term enhancement imp 9 disposition the trial courts order is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. ______________________, j. hoffstadt we concur: _________________________, acting p. j. ashmann-gerst _________________________, j. chavez
