(b)(1)(c), 12022.53, subds. (b), (c), (d).) defendant was sentenced to 50 years to life in state prison. we affirm the judgment. we direct the clerk of the superior court to amend the abstract of judgment. ii. the evidence viewed in the light most favorable to the judgment (people v. banks (2014) 59 cal.4th 1113, 1156; people v. manibusan (2013) 58 cal.4th 40, 87), the evidence was as follows. on december 17, 2011, defendanta gang membershot and killed carlos lajovich. defendant also shot and severely injured sergio moreno. although the shooting occurred in rival gang territory, neither victim was a gang member. witnesses saw the person who fired the shots run from the scene of the assault to a waiting white -defendant, thomas castaneda, was the driver. law enforcement officers subsequently searched the residence where defendant and mr. castaneda both lived. the white sport utility vehicle was parked in the backyard. the gun defendant used to shoot the victims was buried in the backyard together with a box of bullets. during the search, which lasted several hours, defendant and mr. castaneda were detained nearby in a parked van. their conversations were recorded. the recordings were played for the jury at trial. after the gun was recovered, a deputy walked past the van holding the weapon in plain view. the following conversation ensued: 1 further statutory references are to the penal code except where otherwise noted. 3 taking me away from my kids. away from my kids fool. [] garcia: fool. be out here for my girls fool. just say it. fuck. [] garcia: fuck homie. [] castaneda: hit fool. [] that fucken shit homie. i got life too, dog. [] . . . [] castaneda: if they get the prints back on that fucken thing, watch. did you get to clean it? [] garcia: huh? [] castaneda: after i got done touching it last. [] garcia: that was the last time i touched it fool. [] castaneda: you touched it last? [] garcia: ah, balas. (bullets) [] castaneda: (inaudible) been there. [] garcia: god, we should have gotten that shit out of here dog. [] castanedgotta say, fuck. whatever dog. [] garcia: despensa (sorry/ apology) fool. i love : what the fuck homie, you gonna let me go down by myself or what, homie? [] castaneda: look, fool. without a dad . . . . if you love me homie you know what to do, homie. [] garcia: if they say fool, who is it dog? sstaneda: [y]eah, fool. [] garcia: that shit there was evidence that, initially, mr. moreno denied recognizing defendant. subsequently, however, mr. moreno admitted immediately recognizing defendant. mr. 4 moreno had seen defendant around the neighborhood. officer brett benson, who testified for the defense, spoke to mr. moreno in the immediate aftermath of the shooting. officer benson was asked about the conversation with mr. moreno. in that conversation, mr. moreno claimed not to have seen the person who fired the shots in the neighborhood prior to that night. detective karen shonka interviewed mr. moreno at the hospital the day after the ive spoke with mr. moreno for a little over 20 minutes. in that interview, mr. moreno denied having seen the person who fired the shots previously. all mr. moreno saw also, mr. moreno said he was intoxicated. so much so it was impossible to see what the person who fired the shots looked like. mr. moreno also several times denied having seen the person who fired the shots before. mr. moreno did, however, give detective shonka a description of the person who fired the shots that was c on december 23, 2011, six days after the shooting, mr. moreno identified defendant in a photographic lineup. it took mr. moreno about five seconds to identify defendant. detective mitchell carrillo showed mr. moreno the photographic lineup. mr. mr. moreno then admitted seeing defendant around the neighborhood from time to time. at trial, mr. moreno testified to recognizing defendant as soon as they walked up to one another on the evening of the shooting. mr. moreno had seen defendant in the neighborhood prior to the shooting. dr. mitchell eisen testified for the defense on eyewitness identification and suggestibility. dr. eisen discussed multiple factors influencing and detracting from eyewitness identifications hypothetical scenarioa shooting. the following day that witness is specifically asked by the police whether [he has] ever seen the shooter in the neighborhood before and he answers no. assume that some point after that he . . . hears from family and friends that [the] shooter may have been someone from the 5 neighborhood and the police develop a suspect, put the suspect in the six-pack and the suspect is in fact from the neighborhood and someone that the witness has encountered before. [] assume that the witness points to the person he knows from the area, -the shooter. [] based on just the research in general, what is the best indicator of a ent or the report given after an dr. eisen responded that memory reports given closer in time to the event are the best indication of what someone remembers. iii. discussion a. evidence code section 356 as noted abconversation while they were detained in a van. defendant sought to admit, under evidence code section 356, portions of a subsequent conversation between the codefendants. the conversation took place several hours later, after the two men were transported to a jail and placed in separate holding cells: garcia]: . . . that shit should have never been there dog. [] [castaneda]: what? [] [garcia]: that thing. [] [castaneda]: yeah? it happens fool. [] [garcia]: fucking wicked, was exculpatory in that it demonstrated buried in ackyard. somewhere. . . . [] . . . [] . . . [t]wo completely different conversations. so -- and there is no exception [to the hearsay rule] evidence code section 356 states in part: [a] . . . conversation . . . is given in evidence by one party, the whole on the same subject may be inquired into by 6 an adverse party; . . . and when a detached . . . conversation . . . is given in evidence, any other . . . conversation . . . which is necessary to make it understood may also be given in evithe use of selected aspects of a conversation . . . so as to create a misleading impression on the subjects addressed. (people v. price [(1992)] 3 cal.4th 195, 235.) thus, if a the same interview or conversation, even if they are self- (people v. breaux [(1991)] 1 cal.4th 281, 302; people v. hamilton (1989) 48 cal.3d 1142, 1174.)people v. arias (1996) 13 cal.4th 92, 156; accord, people v. williams (2006) 40 cal.4th 287, 319.) our review is for an abuse of discretion. (people v. williams, supra, 40 cal.4th at p. 319; people v. parrish (2007) 152 cal.app.4th 263, 274.) we find no abuse of discretion. ievidence code section 356 discretion to exclude a conversation between the codefendants to explain statements they made several hours earlier at a different location. (people v. williams, supra, 40 cal.4th at p. 319; people v. barrick (1982) 33 cal.3d 115, 131-132; people v. johnson (2010) 183 cal.app.4th 253, 287.) the two statements were not part of the same conversation. the two conversations were separated in time and place. also, without abusing its discretion, the trial court could rule the jailhouse conversation was not necessary to make the earlier conversation understood. (people v. farley (2009) 46 cal.4th 1053, 1103; people v. barrick, supra, 33 cal.3d at p. 131, fn. 4; people v. johnson, supra, 183 cal.app.4th at p. 288.) federal constitutional rights. (see people v. gonzales (2012) 54 cal.4th 1234, 1258-1259; people v. lucas (1995) 12 cal.4th 415, 464-465.) moreover, given the strength of the evidence against defendant, any error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. 7 b. caljic no. 2.92 the jury was instructed pursuant to caljic no. 2.92 as follows: the weight to be given eyewitness identification testimony, you should consider the believability of the eyewitness as well as other factors which bear upon the accuracy of [s] identification of the defendant, including, but not limited to, any of the following: [] . . . [] the extent to which the witness is either certain or uncertain of the identification; (italics added; see also calcrim no. 315.) defendant argues caljic no. 2.92to the extent it discusses certaintyis contrary to recent social science research on eyewitness identification and human memory. our review is de novo. (people v. posey (2004) 32 cal.4th 193, 218; people v. guiuan (1998) 18 cal.4th 558, 569-570.) we decline to so hold. our supreme court has repeatedly approved the certainty factor in caljic no. 2.92. (people v. ward (2005) 36 cal.4th 186, 213; people v. arias, supra, 13 cal.4th at p. 168; people v. johnson (1992) 3 cal.4th 1183, 1231-1232; people v. wright (1988) 45 cal.3d 1126, 1141.) hence there was no error. the jury was properly instructed pursuant to caljic no. 2.92. (people v. ward, supra, 36 cal.4th at p. 213; people v. arias, supra, 13 cal.4th at p. 168; people v. johnson, supra, 3 cal.4th at pp. 1231-1232; people v. wright, supra, 45 cal.3d at p. 1141.) even if there was error, it was harmless under any standard of review. the accuracy and reliability was extensively explored through: cross-examination; testimony as to initial failure to identify defendant; opinion testimony on factors undermining eyewitness identification; and argument to the jury. (see people v. ward, supra, 36 cal.4th at p. 214; see also people v. boyer (2006) 38 cal.4th 412, 481; people v. sanders (1995) 11 cal.4th 475, 510.) c. cumulative error defendant contends he is entitled to reversal because of cumulative error. we find 8 effect of all the errors requires reversal. (people v. jones (2013) 57 cal.4th 899, 981; people v. edwards (2013) 57 cal.4th 658, 746.) d. the abstract of judgment the trial court orally imposed a $40 court operations assessment ( 1465.8, subd. (a)(1)) and a $30 court facilities assessment (gov. code,  70373, subd. (a)(1)) as to each count. we asked the parties to brief the question whether the june 9, 2014 abstract of judgment must be amended to include those fees. (see people v. jones (2012) 54 cal.4th 1, 89; people v. mitchell (2001) 26 cal.4th 181, 185-188.) in response, appointed appellate counsel, sharon m. jones, filed an amended abstract of judgment in the trial court. the abstract of judgment filed on april 27, 2015, includes the court operations and court facilities assessments. addressing restitutionhas also been amended. and, as amended, it does not appear to reflect the the question whether the make restitution to the state victim compensation board in the sum of $68,000, to reimburse payments to the victim from the restitution fund, plus interest at 10 percent per year from the date of sentencing. (pen. code,  1202.4, subd. (f)(4).) make restitution to the victim, sergio alonso-moreno, in the sum of $34,509.46 plus interest at 10 percent per year from the date of sentencing. (pen. code,  1202.4, subd. (f).) co-defendant thomas anthony castaneda has been found jointly and severally liable for the foregoing we will direct that the abstract of judgment be amended to so reflect. (see people v. jones, supra, 54 cal.4th at p. 89; people v. mitchell, supra, 26 cal.4th at pp. 185-188.) 9 iv. disposition the judgment is affirmed. upon remittitur issuance, the superior court clerk must amend the abstract of judgment to tution to the state victim compensation board in the sum of $68,000, to reimburse payments to the victim from the restitution fund, plus interest at 10 percent per year from the date of sentencing. (pen. code,  1202.4, subd. (f)(4).) make restitution to the victim, sergio alonso-moreno, in the sum of $34,509.46 plus interest at 10 percent per year from the date of sentencing. (pen. code,  1202.4, subd. (f).) co-defendant thomas anthony castaneda has been found jointly and severally liable for the foregoing restitution the superior court clerk must deliver a copy of the amended abstract of judgment to the department of corrections and rehabilitation. not to be published in the official reports turner, p. j. we concur: mosk, j. kriegler, j.
