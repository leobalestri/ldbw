the city of gardena when she pulled to a stop where appellant was waiting. appellant had several items with her and was talking to herself. appellant entered the bus and dropped off some bags, then left and got the rest of her things. appellant paid her fare with an invalid token. willard did not say anything because appellant seemed upset. appellant sat in a seat behind and to the right of willard. she became more angry and more verbal, and appellant stood up and spit several times toward a trash can next to willard told her to stop, and slid the trash can toward appellant. appellant replied, spit on you. willard telephoned her supervisor and asked for police assistance. at one of the next stops, appellant got up and began collecting her stuff. she asked if willard had contacted the police. willard said that she had. willard took off her seatbelt and stood up to see if the police were behind her. appellant then struck willard about three times on the head with a metal makeup case. willard lost consciousness for a couple of seconds. chanita gardner, another gardena city bus driver, heard willard call for help . and saw appellant strike willard on the head with the metal case. gardner grabbed appellant and pulled her off the bus. appellant went limp, and gardner let her go. appellant walked away. gardena police department officer evan jackson took appellant into custody about five blocks from the incident. appellant did not appear to be injured and was very agitated. she had a metal case in her possession. 4 defense evidence appellant testified that she was waiting at the bus stop on the day of the incident with several items, including a makeup case. the bus sped past her abruptly just out of [her] reach, out of [her] realm of once seated on the bus, appellant thought willard was deliberately trying to make the bus shake and was looking at her in the eflection. appellant had to spit, so she waited until the bus stopped and spit out the open door. willard slid the trash can toward appellant, and appellant spit in the trash can three times. appellant heard willard say on the phone that someone was spitting. appellant was scared of being arrested and got ready to exit the bus at the next stop. she saw another bus stopped in front and felt uneasy. appellant and willard stood up, and willard blocked the exit. willard began to strike appellant with an object in her hand. appellant then struck willard twice with her makeup case before another bus driver put appellant in a chokehold. while appellant was being held in the chokehold, willard began striking appellant chest with an object. appellant fought back by hitting willard on the head again with her makeup case. as appellant struck willard, she was thinking: appellant testified that she struck willard about 12 times. procedural background numerous discu[b]ecause the defendant did not choose to waive her back time and to seek treatment, i think i am really put in a position of sentencing her to the maximum time allowable under the law because i do believe that she is a violent person when she is not on medication and she is a danger and had defense counsel noted that appellant suffered from mental illness and some fixed delusions, and argued these should be taken into account as mitigating factors. counsel 5 erm instead of the high term. situationviolent she was trying to kill the bus driver. while the prosecutor preferred that appellant go to a mental healthcare facility, he also felt that appellant needed to be separated from society for as long as possible the trial court stated that it also preferred that appellant get treatment for her mental health issues, but noted that she refused to see any mental healthcare professionals. mental health treatment program she indicated that she was interested in doing that. the thing[] that has happened since then is she has not come out of her cell in order to speak with mental health professionals. [] . . . i can say she refused to come out of her cell to speak with people, but never flat-out refused the offer that the court gave. it was more of an implied ref the trial court then spoke directly to appellant: [the court]: ms. ficklin [appellant], your attorney and the prosecutor and i had discussed that youand this is a big deal for youyou would be waiving all of your back-time. you would be waiving like a total of 1,723 days. -year sentence in prison which is what you will at least get now. you will actually get more now, but minus the credits, having that prison sentence hang over your head with the understanding that nothing would happen to you for a certain number of years. [] . . . [] you would be on probation, but you would be required to be taking medication, 6 treated instead of going back to prison now. that is what we had discussed. [] but because you refuse to talk to anybody or come out of your cell or whatever, that option is really not available at this time. [] so, ms. langston [defense counsel], i want to hear from you if you want the court to still consider that option. court not to take the refusal into consideration the way that the court was terming it. i think it is a different type of refusal that the court was originally speaking of. the table at this time? : i time, and the reason is that i have had dr. parham look into it. i had the mental health professionals come. basically they anything. so that has happened, but ideasourt to think that [appellant] said i flat-out refused to do that. i will not do that. that is not the way it happened. : possibility is here anymore. [appellant]: for probation? : for you to do probation, waive your back time, and get into a mental health treatment program. [appellant]: i think that is a great option. : okay. mr. harlan [prosecutor], i will hear from you. i know that your office had agreed to that. you had gotten some indication from your supervisors . . . [] . . . [] the option, i believe that we had discussed was, somewhere around 5 years of probation, she would be sentenced to the 5 years of state prison, she would waive all of her back-time, and ifms. ficklin, you need to listen very carefully to thisand if you got into a program, if they were able to find a program for you, this is only if they can find that program, you would have to stay in that program and you would have to comply with all of the rules of that program. so that might be hard to for you to do. what do you think about that? 7 [appellant]: whatever my attorney thinks. : that is a big burden that you are putting on your attorney because she needs input from you whether you are going to be able to comply with that. : she is going to be able to get into a program. i think that mental health has tried, and that is the extent of it. essentially dr. parham told me there is nothing that we can do at this point. able to do that. whether she actually wants to do that or not, give her a false hope of being able to do that if it is truly not a possibility. : then we are going to go ahead then on the sentencing. the trial court then sentenced appellant to a total term of eight years in state prison, with 1,723 days of presentence custody credits. discussion applicable law people v. thompson the record on appeal sheds no light on why counsel acted or failed to act in the manner challenged[,] . . . unless counsel was asked for an explanation the claim on appeople v. mendoza tello (1997) 15 cal.4th 264, 266.) deficient when measured against the standard of a reasonably competent deficient performance resulted in prejudice to defendant in the sense that it so undermined the proper functioning of the adversarial process that the trial cannot be relied on as having produced a just result. (people v. kipp (1998) 18 cal.4th 349, 366, quoting strickland v. washington (1984) 466 u.s. 668, 686; in re lucas (2004) 33 cal.4th 682, 721; people v. frye (1998) 18 cal.4th 894, 979.) 8 to demonstrate prejudice, the defefailures the trial was unreliable or fundamentally unfair. (in re visciotti (1996) 14 defendant would have obtained (people v. cunningham (2001) 25 cal.4th 926, 1003.) mere speculation does not meet the sixth amendment standard for demonstrating prejudice. (in re clark (1993) 5 cal.4th 750, 766.) it is not enoaffirmatively show that the omissions of defense counsel involved a critical issue, and that the omissions cannot be explained on the basis of any knowledgeable choice of tactics.people v. jackson (1980) 28 cal.3d 264, 288.) analysis appellant cannot demonstrate either that her defense counsel performed appellant argues that defense counsel performed deficiently at the sentencing hearing by failing to advocate for a grant of probation. not dependent on appellant being in an in-patient facility, as her counsel apparently believed. but the record shows that any probationary term was dependent on appellant participating in some kind of treatment program. when the trial court first spoke directly to appellant during the sentencing hearing, the court statedtreated instead of going back to prison now. ththe court then stated to appellant that it did not think the possibility of probation was still an option, saying that probation would include a waiver of back time and for appellant the court reiterated that the option of probation which the parties had discussed included a waiver of back time and being in a treatment program. in this regard, the court addressed appellant again, telling [a]nd if you got into a program, if they were 9 able to find a program for you, this is only if they can find that program, you would have to stay in that program and you would have to comply with all of the rules of that program. defense counsel then stated that she d counsel explained that she had sent mental healthcare professionals to visit appellant in jail, but appellant had refused to leave her cell to talk to any professionals, and one of the professionals had stated there was nothing more that could be done for appellant . counsel added that she did not want to give appellant a false sense of hope of being able to get into a treatment program. when defense counsel had finished speaking, the trial court did not indicate that counsel had misunderstood the proposed terms of probation or correct her in any way. instead, the court immediately proceeded to sentencing. this was not a case where defense counsel simply stood next to her client and acquiesced in everything the trial court and the prosecutor suggested. indeed, at the beginning of the sentencing hearing, defense counsel asked the trial court to exercise leniency in sentencing appellant, urging the court tmitigating factor and to strike her priors and choose the midterm instead of the high term. defense counsel also informed the court that appellant had expressed an interest in a mental healthcare treatment program and made clear to the court that appellant had never -cell to speak to any mental healthcare professionals. with mental healthcare professionals, a prison sentence was the only option left. defense counsel was not ineffective for failing to argue for an alternate probation disposition that was no longer a possibility. even assuming that a reasonably competent attorney would have argued for have received a more favorable outcome. (people v. riel (2000) 22 cal.4th 1153, 1175; people v. frye, supra, 18 cal.4th at p. 979.) appellant has not demonstrated an ability to comply with a court order that she participate in a mental healthcare program and take 10 her medication. she also never stated that she was willing to waive her custody credits, which was a necessary condition of probation. thus, there is no indication that the trial court would have stayed a prison term and imposed a probationary period, especially the bus driver. disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. _____________________________, acting p. j. ashmann-gerst we concur: ______________________________, j. chavez ______________________________, j.* ferns * judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
