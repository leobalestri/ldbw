convictions for assault with a deadly weapon and making criminal threats. he contends the evidence was insufficient to support a gang enhancement, and in light of people v. sanchez (2016) 63 cal.4th 665 (sanchez), testimony violated his confrontation and due process rights. both appellant and the people contend the trial court made sentencing errors. we conclude the trial court committed various sentencing errors, and accordingly reverse as to the sentence, and remand for resentencing. in all other respects, we affirm. factual and procedural background 1. facts a. the offenses carlos galvan sr. and his family, including his 19-year-old son, carlos galvan jr., had lived in a home on east 59th street in los angeles for 18 years. appellant duenas, who was 31 years old, lived several houses away. the florencia 13 criminal street gang controlled the area. gang graffiti was prevalent on the street and gang members frequented the area. the galvans believed duenas was a florencia 13 gang member because of his tattoos and appearance. they knew his moniker pollo or [l] galvan jr. was not a gang member. a week before thanksgiving 2014, duenas stood outside frightened, galvan jr. declined to do so. duenas said he had heard galvan jr. talking shit a day or two later, galvan jr. began receiving threatening text messages from an unknown source. one stated that if galvan jr. did not meet the sender at the liquor store, going to find [him] galvan jr. believed the 3 messages were from duenas. the galvans had not had problems with duenas until this incident. on november 27, 2014, the galvans hosted a thanksgiving dinner at their home. at approximately 5:15 p.m. galvan sr. and jr. were on the front porch. duenas stood outside their property and yelled for galvan jr., saying, hey, come out, son of a bitch. duenas indicated he wanted to fight. galvan jr. stated he did not want to fight, but would do so if that would death threats. when galvan jr. exited the yard, duenas hit him in the mouth and nose with a metal baseball bat, causing him to fall, hit his head, and briefly lose consciousness. galvan sr. and his brother, julio1who had just arrivedassisted galvan jr. duenas jumped up and down on the hoods of cars parked in the he then returned to his own house. minutes later duenas returned to the galvan home, armed with a tech 9 submachine gun in his waistband and accompanied by codefendant leandro toro.2 toro was not wearing a shirt, and duenas was either shirtless or wearing a to be gang-related. duenas pointed the gun at galvan sr. and o kill you son of a bitch. galvan sr. believed duenas would carry out his threat because he was a gang member. duenas stated he did not want the galvan family galvan sr. 1 for ease of reference, and with no disrespect, we hereinafter refer to julio galvan by his first name. 2 toro was acquitted of assault with a deadly weapon and is not a party to this appeal. 4 believed this statement indicated duenas gang understood this to be a reference to du toro hit julio in the back with a two-by-four. during the incident, a crowd of 30 to 40 people gathered in the street. police officers arrived and arrested toro and duenas. officers did not find a gun on duenas or in the area. an officer found the baseball bat on the front lawn of the house across the -by-four in the backyard of that residence. neither galvan sr. nor jr. had a weapon. when arrested, duenas had abrasions on his knees, back, elbows, hands, and head. galvan jr. was treated at the hospital. the blow from the bat loosened one of his front teeth and bloodied his lip. at the time of trial he still suffered pain in his teeth and jaw, suffered from headaches, and had difficulty eating. the galvan family moved from the east 59th street house after the incident. galvan jr. explained he moved because he b. gang expert testimony los angeles county machuca testified as a gang expert for the people, as follows. the florencia 13, a hispanic gang, has approximately 2300 documented members in los angeles. it has a distinctive hand sign and claims territory bordered by slauson avenue, central avenue, state street, and 92nd street. the area where the the 5 primary activities include carjacking, robbery, burglary, extortion, assault, murder, and narcotics sales. the florencia 13 gang iextremely violent. gangs make money through narcotics sales, extortion, and burglaries. it benefits a gang to have a reputation for violence. gang members instill fear in the community by committing crimes and persons who cooperate with law enforcement can be assaulted or murdered. in the middlethat is, commit crimes, at the bottom. one joins a gang by being once a member, one cannot leave the gang, although some persons become inactive members. gang members show allegiance to the gang by displaying and a nongang member the gang. removal of tattoos does not demonstrate a person has distanced himself from the gang. gang members. his opinion was based on his review of field identification (fi) cards and arrest reports, conversations with other deputies, and examination of the m fi cards examined by machuca, prepared by nontestifying officers between 1998 and 2010, indicated duenas had admitted his florencia 13 membership on six or seven occasions. the fi cards also indicated duenas had been observed in the company of other florencia 13 gang members five or six times, and made note of 6 his gang-related tattoos. machuca had also reviewed a series of and had personally observed his tattoos shortly before trial. at various times, duenas had on his left for rencia 13 clique, on his chest; back of his head; ; where the gang originated. some of these tattoos, including the time of trial duenas still sported four to five florencia-related tattoos. fi cards prepared between 2008 and 2014 indicated toro admitted his gang membership on three occasions, in 2008, 2009, and 2014. machuca personally observed and reviewed pgang-related tattoos, which included south when given a hypothetical based upon the evidence presented, machuca opined that the offenses would benefit the florencia 13 gang and were committed in association with or at the direction of florencia 13 gang members. the crimes showed an association of two documented gang members of the florencia 13 the crimes would enhintimidation in the community. this, in turn, would make it less unfettered commission of future criminal activity. 7 in support of the penal code section 186.223 gang allegation, machuca testified regarding two predicate crimes: a november 8, 2012 carjacking committed by florencia 13 member danny ortega, and a may 30, 2012 felon-in-possession of a firearm conviction suffered by florencia 13 gang member robert navarro.4 c. defense evidence duenas presented the testimony of two neighbors who claimed to have observed portions of the altercation. adriana garcia, a former florencia 13 gang member, lived across the street from the galvan family and had known duenas for 28 years. on thanksgiving day, she observed galvan sr. make an , push duenas, and then hit duenas with a bat. when garcia told galvan sr. not to hit duenas, he replied, garcia wrested the bat from galvan sr. and threw it in her yard. an individual with the a member of the 85th locos gang and a relative of the galvans, , attempted to run over duenas, and then drove off in a car full of persons garcia according to neighbor venita orr, the galvans and another man yelled at and argued with duenas. one of the galvans swung at duenas with a four-by-four and the other hit him with a bat. someone attempted to run over duenas with a red vehicle. 3 all further undesignated statutory references are to the penal code. 4 we discuss this evidence in more detail where relevant below. 8 both garcia and orr testified that duenas did not have a bat or a gun and did not hit anyone. neither saw toro at the scene. a gang expert testified for the defense that it is possible for a gang member to disassociate from a gang while still living in such persons may still have gang tattoos and wear gang attire, but they do not actively participate in gang activities. it is difficult for a gang member to cut all ties with his former gang unless he can afford to move away from the neighborhood. step in disassociating with the gang, because it shows disrespect for the gang. tattoo removal is costly and beyond the means of many gang members. if a person had no contacts with law enforcement between 2010 and 2014, as indicated on fi cards, and the gang was still active in the area, this likely meant the person had disassociated from the gang. 2. procedure trial was by jury. duenas was convicted of assault on galvan jr. with a deadly weapon, a metal bat ( 245, subd. (a)(1), count 1) and making criminal threats against galvan sr. ( 422, subd. (a), count 2).5 as to count 1, the jury found duenas personally inflicted great bodily injury on galvan jr. ( 12022.7, subd. (a)), but found the charged gang enhancement ( 186.22, subd. (b)(1)(b)) not true. as to count 2, the jury found duenas 5 the jury also convicted duenas of assault with a machine gun on galvan sr. ( 245, subd. (a)(3), count 4). however, the trial court granted duenas as to count 4 on the ground that the jury should have been instructed on the lesser included offense of assault with a firearm. the prosecutor declined to retry count 4, and the trial court dismissed the charge pursuant to section 1385. 9 personally used a firearm ( 12022.5, subd. (a)), and committed the offense for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with a criminal street gang ( 186.22, subd. (b)(1)(b)). the jury acquitted codefendant toro of the single charge alleged against him, assault with a deadly weapon against julio. after a bench trial, the trial court found duenas had suffered a prior conviction of a serious felony ( 667, subds. (a) & (b)-(i), 1170.12). it denied romero motion6 and sentenced him to 31 years in prison. it imposed a restitution fine, a suspended parole revocation restitution fine, a court operations assessment, and a criminal conviction assessment. duenas appeals. discussion 1. the evidence was sufficient to prove the section 186.22 gang allegation duenas contends the evidence was insufficient to support the threatened galvan sr. for the benefit of, in association with, or at the direction of, the florencia 13 criminal street gang. he is incorrect. a. applicable legal principles and standard of review when determining whether the evidence was sufficient to review the entire record in the light most favorable to the judgment to determine whether it contains substantial evidencethat is, evidence that is reasonable, credible, and of solid valuefrom which a reasonable trier of fact could find the (people v. mccurdy (2014) 59 cal.4th 1063, 1104; people v. 6 people v. superior court (romero) (1996) 13 cal.4th 497 (romero). 10 johnson (2015) 60 cal.4th 966, 988.) we presume in support of the judgment the existence of every fact the trier of fact could reasonably deduce from the evidence. (people v. medina (2009) 46 cal.4th 913, 919.) reversal is not warranted unless it appears substantial evidence to (people v. bolin (1998) 18 cal.4th 297, 331; people v. zamudio (2008) 43 cal.4th 327, 357.) this standard applies to section 186.22 gang enhancements (people v. leon (2008) 161 cal.app.4th 149, 161; people v. augborne (2002) 104 cal.app.4th 362, 371), and to cases in which the prosecution relies primarily on circumstantial evidence. (people v. brown (2014) 59 cal.4th 86, 106.) we consider all evidence admitted at trial without objection, even if some of the evidence was admitted erroneously. (people v. story (2009) 45 cal.4th 1282, 1296; people v. panah (2005) 35 cal.4th 395, 476; people v. lara (2017) 9 cal.app.5th 296, 328, fn. 17.) section 186.22, subdivision (b)(1) provides for a sentence enhancement when the defendant is convicted of an enumerated felony committed for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with any criminal street gang, with the specific intent to promote, further, or assist in any criminal conduct by gang members[.] (people v. lara, supra, 9 cal.app.5th at p. 326.) meaning of the statute, the people must prove: (1) the group is an ongoing association of three or more persons sharing a common name, identifying sign, or symbol; (2) primary activities is the commission of one or more statutorily engage in, or have engaged in, a pattern of criminal gang activity. 11 attempted commission of, conspiracy to commit, or solicitation of, enum period. [citations.] the predicate offenses must have been committed on separate occasions, or by two or more persons. (id. at pp. 326-327; sanchez, supra, 63 cal.4th at p. 698; people v. duran (2002) 97 cal.app.4th 1448, 1457.) the charged crime may serve as a predicate offense. (people v. ochoa (2017) 7 cal.app.5th 575, 581; duran, at p. 1457.) not every benefit. (people v. albillar (2010) 51 cal.4th 47, 60.) b. the evidence was sufficient we discern no evidentiary insufficiency. detective gang has approximately 2,300 members and uses a distinctive hand sign. machuca, who had spoken with between 100 and 150 florencia 13 gang members and served 20 search warrants regarding the gang, testified without objection that tprimary activities included carjacking, robbery, burglary, extortion, assault, murder, and narcotics sales, all of which are offenses enumerated in section 186.22, subdivision (e). indeed, duenas does not appear to dispute the sufficiency of the evidence to prove the florencia 13 gang qualified as a criminal street gang within the meaning of the statute. (see people v. sengpadychith (2001) 26 cal.4th 316, 324 [gang expert testimony sufficient to establish primary activities element].) the evidence was likewise sufficient to establish that duenas, a gang member, committed the section 422 offense for 12 the benefit of the florencia 13 gang. the expert opined that duenas and toro were active florencia 13 gang members. both galvans believed duenas was a florencia 13 gang member based on his tattoos and his appearance. (see people v. albillar, supra, 51 cal.4th at p. supported finding rapes were gang-related].) the incident occurred in the graffiti was prevalent. the confrontation between the galvans and duenas was witnessed by a crowd of neighbors. duenas was either shirtless or clad in a muscle shirt, allowing for display of his gang tattoos. when threatening galvan sr. with the gun, duenas stated he did not want the galvan family living on the theremean duenas was the boss of the gang in the area. according to all of you. which galvan jr. understood as a reference would surround the from the foregoing circumstances, the jury could reasonably infer duenas intended to intimidate the galvans and assert control over tbehalf. when given a hypothetical based on the evidence presented, machuca opined that the charged crimes were for the benefit of the gang, because their commission would enhance the community. on hypothetical questions that track[] the evidence, whether the [crime], if the jury found it in fact occurred, would have been for a people v. garcia (2017) 9 cal.app.5th 364, 375-376.) 13 the penal code section 186.22, subdivision (b)(1), gang people v. vang (2011) 52 cal.4th 1038, 1048; people v. albillar, supra, 51 cal.4th at p. 63.) finally, machuca testified that danny ortega and robert navarro, who were both florencia 13 gang members, had committed enumerated crimes (carjacking and felon in possession of a firearm) in 2012, as indicated by certified minute orders. , that is, a pattern of criminal gang activity. (see people v. duran, supra, 97 cal.app.4th at pp. 1459-1463.) duenas concedes that the crimes committed by ortega and navarro qualified as predicate offenses for purposes of section 186.22, and that their convictions were sufficiently proven through the certified minute orders. (see evid. code,  452.5, subd. (b)(1); duran, at p. 1458.) ient evidence the men were florencia 13 gang members. as we discuss below, it is a estimony, which was admitted without objection, was sufficient to establish both that machuca had a factual basis for his statements7 and to 7 the expert testimony offered here is unlike that presented in people v. hunt (1971) 4 cal.3d 231, cited by duenas. in hunt, the defendant was found in possession of prescription vials of methedrine in a travel case. acknowledging that an expert may opine that contraband is possessed for sale based on factors such as quantity, packaging, and normal usage, our supreme court narcotics had been purchased by prescription; there was no showing the officer had experience with prescription drug use. 14 . (see people v. miranda (2016) 2 cal.app.5th 829, 840-842 [pattern of criminal activity been convicted of predicate crimes while members of the gang]; people v. hill (2011) 191 cal.app.4th 1104, 1120; people v. williams (2009) 170 cal.app.4th 587, 626.) ry expert testimony. but this challenge has been forfeited because he failed to object below. (evid. code,  353; people v. jackson (2016) 1 cal.5th 269, 366 [defendant forfeited claim that oftestimony lacked foundation by failing to object on this ground at trial]; people v. dowl (2013) 57 cal.4th 1079, 1087-1088.)8 as we sanchez.9 (id. at pp. 237-238.) the facts of hunt are entirely dissimilar to those here, and hunt does not cast doubt on the substantial 8 to the extent duenas argues his counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to object, this contention fails. to prevail on an ineffective assistance claim on direct appeal, the record must affirmatively disclose the lack of a rational tactical purpose for the challenged act or omission. (people v. ray (1996) 13 cal.4th 313, 349.) here the record suggests an obvious the people could simply have elicited more information from machuca . 9 even if the evidence had been admitted in violation of sanchez, this would not demonstrate an evidentiary insufficiency. 15 duenas nonetheless contends the evidence was insufficient. first he asserts there was insufficient evidence he and toro were active florencia 13 gang members in november 2014.10 he was 36 years old and some of his gang-related tattoos had been removed, and r could was speculative. his dispute with the galvans was precipitated by his belief that galvan jr. was dating his sister and had disparaged the duenas family. his threats were toated to have been gang-e the victims could easily have identified him; he did not use gang ga at intimidation. the galvans were not actually intimidated as they reported the crime to the police and testified at trial. these arguments amount to a request that this court reweigh the evidence and substitute our judgment for that of the trier of fact. this we cannot do. we resolve neither credibility issues nor evidentiary conflicts. atkins v. city of los angeles (2017) 8 cal.app.5th 696, 739-740, italics omitted; see people v. panah, supra, 35 cal.4th at p. 476; people v. bailey (1991) 1 evidence technically incompetent admitted without objection must be given as much weight in the reviewing court in reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence as if it were competent 10 duenas also argues that because toro was acquitted, the crime cannot have been committed in association with a fellow gang member. preclude such a finding, the evidence was nonetheless sufficient to establish the criminal threats offense was committed for the benefit of the gang. 16 (people v. jackson (2014) 58 cal.4th 724, 749; people v. friend (2009) 47 cal.4th 1, 41; people v. cortes (1999) 71 cal.app.4th 62, e ; people v. iboa (2012) 207 cal.app.4th 111, 117.) nor does duenaspeople v. ramon (2009) 175 cal.app.4th 843, assist him. in ramon, two gang members, in a stolen truck, were stopped by police, in territory claimed by expert testified that driving a stolen truck and possessing an could commit crimes with the truck and the gun, thereby spreading fear and intimidation. (id. at pp. 847-848.) the substantial evidence supporting the gang enhancement; he simply informed the jury how he felt the case should be resolved. (id. at p. 851.) there were no facts from which the expert could discern whether the defendants were acting on their own behalf or on behalf of the gang. (ibid.) but the evidence and testimony presented in the instant matter contrasts with that in ramon. the evidence showed duenas provoked a physical confrontation with, and assaulted, galvan jr. he then threatened galvan sr. in language the jury could infer was gang-related. under these reputation and instill fear in the community was not speculative. duenas also mounts an attack on gang expert testimony in general, urging that it is based on eotype, hearsay, and unreliable sources and to that extent cannot 17 constitute substantial evidence. he contends that information collected by officers regarding suspected gang members subjective and biased to be the type of knowledge upon which experts may reasonably rely to prove gang membership or the elements of a gang enhancement.fi card information is derived anonymous sources;from officers and gang members may be self-serving and inconsistent; officers may exaggerate the extent of gang activity; admissions of gang membership, attire, and tattoos are unreliable indicators of gang membership; gang officer testimony is based on a flawed methodology and data; and because gang officers are charged with suppressing gang activity, they are biased and should be disqualified from testifying. duenas urges, based on the foregoing, that the admission of gang expert testimony undercuts any presumption of innocence. expert testimony about gang culture and habits is the type of evidence a jury may rely on to reach a verdict on a gang-related offense or a finding on a gang allegation (people v. ferraez (2003) 112 cal.app.4th 925, 930), and such expert testimony may prove a section 186.22 gang enhancement. (see, e.g., people v. albillar, supra, 51 cal.4th at p. 63; people v. sengpadychith, supra, 26 cal.4th at p. 324.) to the extent duenas advocates for policy-based limits on gang expert testimony, his contentions are best directed to the legislature, not this court. (see people v. fuentes (2016) 1 cal.5th 218, 231.) to the extent he believed particular testimony lacked foundation or was otherwise unreliable, it was incumbent upon him to interpose specific objections in the trial court. having failed to do so, 18 duenas has forfeited any appellate challenge on these bases. (see people v. dowl, supra, 57 cal.4th at pp. 1087-1088; people v. miranda, supra, 2 cal.app.5th at pp. 837-838.) 2. admission of gang evidence sufficiency challenge, we turn to his contention that the gang evidence was inadmissible for three reasons: it was unduly prejudicial under evidence code section 352; the gang expert improperly testified to the ultimate issue in the case; and the evidence constituted testimonial hearsay under sanchez and its admission violated his confrontation clause rights. we address these issues seriatim. a. evidence code section 352 duenas asserts that the gang evidence was unduly prejudicial and should have been excluded under evidence code section 352, and its admission violated his due process right to a fair trial. we disagree. gang evidence is admissible if it is logically relevant to some material issue in the case other than character, is not more prejudicial than probative, and is not cumulative. (people v. carter (2003) 30 cal.4th 1166, 1194; people v. samaniego (2009) 172 cal.app.4th 1148, 1167; people v. avitia (2005) 127 cal.app.4th 185, 192.) it is inadmissible if introduced only to show a ds criminal disposition. (avitia, at p. 192.) should not be admitted if its probative value is minimal. people v. hernandez (2004) 33 cal.4th 1040, 1049.) a trial court has broad discretion in determining whether evidence is relevant and whether evidence code section 352 precludes its admission. (people v. jones (2017) 3 cal.5th 583, 609; people v. mills (2010) 48 cal.4th 158, 195.) rulings 19 regarding relevancy and evidence code section 352 are reviewed under the abuse of discretion standard. (people v. lee (2011) 51 cal.4th 620, 643; people v. hamilton (2009) 45 cal.4th 863, 929-930.) the people are correct that, because duenas did not object to the gang testimony below, he has forfeited his due process and evidence code section 352 claims. (evid. code,  353, subd. (a); people v. gutierrez (2009) 45 cal.4th 789, 818; people v. valdez (2012) 55 cal.4th 82, 138; people v. partida (2005) 37 cal.4th 428, 433-435.) duenas contends t object resulted in forfeiture, he received ineffective assistance of counsel. to establish ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant must show that (1) an objective standard of reasonableness under prevailing professional norms; and (2) prejudicial. (strickland v. washington (1984) 466 u.s. 668, 687; people v. brown, supra, 59 cal.4th at p. 109; people v. mai (2013) 57 cal.4th 986, 1009.) becausas we discuss below, his ineffective assistance claim likewise fails. people v. bradley (2012) 208 cal.app.4th 64, 90; people v. szadziewicz (2008) 161 cal.app.4th 823, 836 s failure to make a futile or unmeritorious motion or duenas was a gang member who neighborhood by intimidating the galvans in the presence of numerous neighbors. the information included section 186.22, subdivision (b) gang allegations on all counts alleged against duenas. to prove the gang enhancements, the people were 20 required to establish the existence of the gang, the predicate offenses, , and that the crimes were committed in association with, or to benefit, the gang. to that end, evidence of the culture, habits, and violent nature of the gang was relevant and highly probative. (see people v. hernandez, supra, 33 cal.4th at pp. 1050-1051, 1053.) admissible when the very reason for the underlying crime, that is people v. samaniego, supra, 172 cal.app.4th at p. 1167.) how his statements could induce fear in the victims, as well as demonstrate how he and toro were working together to benefit the gang. (see hernandez, at p. 1053.) membership was also highly probative to establish the criminal threats offense; the fact a person threatening violence is a known gang member tends to support the conclusion a threat was specific and unequivocal and caused the victim to experience sustained fear. (see  422.) the incentive for criminal behavior, its probative value generally exceeds its prejudicial effect, and wide latitude is permitted in admitting evidence of it samaniego, at p. 1168.) the trial court did not abuse its discretion by admitting the gang evidence.11 11 duenas also mony was machuca in that maccriminal street gang activity. thus, he duenas offers no authority for the novel proposition that a law enforcement officer is biased, and his or her testimony must be excluded as 21 nor has duenas established admission of the gang evidence violated his due process rights. to make such a showing, a people v. albarran (2007) 149 cal.app.4th 214, 229.) no permissible inferences the jury may draw from the evidence can its admission violate due process. even then, the evidence [citations.] only under such circumstances can it be inferred that the jury must have used the evidence for an improper (ibid.) we detect no such showing here. conextraneous to the case. unlike in albarran, the gang evidence was relevant. (see people v. becerrada (2017) 2 cal.5th 1009, 1026.) the gang expert did not attempt to sensationalize the evidence. although duenas complains that the expert failed to provide details about the predicate crimes offered to prove the gang enhancement, testimony served to prevent additional, potentially inflammatory details from being disclosed. the evidence presented had a legitimate purpose and was not unduly inflammatory. (see generally people ex rel. reisig v. acuna (2017) 9 cal.app.5th 1, 31; people v. hunt (2011) 196 cal.app.4th 811, 818; people v. williams, supra, 170 cal.app.4th at p. 612.) would preclude the testimony of most law enforcement officers, a result not required by the law or common sense. to the extent duenas believed detective machuca was biased, he was free to develop such evidence during cross-examination. 22 b. testimony regarding ultimate issues duenas contends that by responding to a hypothetical question based on the evidence in the case, and opining that the offenses were committed for the benefit of the florencia 13 gang, machuca improperly opined on the ultimate issue to be decided by the jury. the defense made no objection to the hypothetical question or to has therefore forfeited the point. (evid. code,  353, subd. (a); people v. coffman and marlow (2004) 34 cal.4th 1, 81-82; people v. roberts (2010) 184 cal.app.4th 1149, 1193.) the claim fails on the merits as well. it is well settled that estimony in the form of an opinion that is otherwise admissible is not objectionable because it embraces the ultimate people v. vang, supra, 52 cal.4th at p. 1048.) expert opinion that a crime was committed for the benefit of a criminal street gang, in response to a hypothetical question, is proper. (id. at pp. 1048-1049.) c. confrontation clause claim testimony on hearsay and confrontation clause grounds. in particular, he challenges (1) fi cards prepared by officers who did not testify at trial as the basis for his opinion that duenas and toro were gang members, and (2) officers as evidence proving the predicate offenses. we conclude the fi cards were admitted in error, but the error was harmless predicate offenses was not hearsay, and therefore did not violate sanchez. 23 (i) applicable legal principles and sanchez the sixth amendment provides that an accused has the right to be confronted with the witnesses against him. (u.s. const., 6th amend.; sanchez, supra, 63 cal.4th at p. 679.) in the seminal case of crawford v. washington (2004) 541 u.s. 36, the high court overruled its prior precedent and held that the sixth amendment generally bars admission at trial of a testimonial out-of-court statement offered for its truth against a criminal defendant, unless the maker of the statement is unavailable to testify and the defendant had a prior opportunity for cross-examination. (id. at p. 68; davis v. washington (2006) 547 u.s. 813, 821; sanchez, at p. 680.) although crawford set forth a new standard for admissibility, the court declined to provide a crawford, at p. 68; people v. hill, supra, 191 cal.app.4th at p. 1134.) under state law, hearsaythat is, an out-of-court statement offered for the truth of its contentis inadmissible unless each level of hearsay falls within an exception to the hearsay rule. (sanchez, supra, 63 cal.4th at pp. 674-675.) in sanchez, the defendant was charged with drug and firearm offenses and active participation in the delhi street gang, along with a section 186.22 gang enhancement. at trial, a gang card as the basis for his expert opinion. those documents indicated sanchez associated with, and had been repeatedly contacted by police while in the presence of, delhi gang members. (sanchez, supra, 63 cal.4th at pp. 671-673.) the expert had never met sanchez and had not been present during any of police contacts. based on the information in the step notice, the police documents, and the fi cards, and the 24 circumstances of the offense at issue, the expert opined that sanchez was a member of the delhi gang and the charged crimes benefitted the gang. (id. at p. 673.) sanchez -specific statements related by the prosecuticonstituted inadmissible hearsay under california law. they were recited by the expert, who presented them as true statements of fact, without the requisite independent proof. some of those hearsay statements were also testimonial and therefore should have been excluded under crawford. the error sanchez, supra, 63 cal.4th at pp. 670-671.) accordingly, the court reversed the true findings on the street gang enhancements. (id. at p. 671.) the court case-specific facts about which the expert has no independent knowledge. case-specific facts are those relating to the particular events and participants alleged to have been sanchez, supra, 63 cal.4th at p. 676.) prior to sanchez, california law allowed an expert to it was hearsay, if a limiting instruction was given. (id. at pp. 678-679.) overruling prior precedent, sanchez concluded: basis for an opinion must (id. at p. 679.) an expert testifies to case-specific out-of-court statements to explain the bases for his opinion, those statements are necessarily considered by the jury for their truth, thus rendering them hearsay. like any other hearsay evidence, it must be properly admitted through an applicable hearsay exception. alternatively, the evidence can be admitted through 25 an appropriate witness and the expert may assume its truth in a properly worded hypothetical question in the traditional id. at p. 684, fn. omitted.) sanchez did not cast doubt on all gang expert testimony. rely on hearsay in forming an opinion, and may tell the jury in general terms sanchez, supra, 63 cal.4th at pp. 685-background information accepted in their field of expertise under the traditional latitude given by the evidence code. they can rely on information within their personal knowledge, and they can give an opinion based on a hypothetical including case-specific facts that are properly proven. they may also rely on nontestimonial hearsay properly admitted under a statutory hearsay excid. at p. 685.) (ii) forfeiture forfeited his hearsay and confrontation clause claims because he failed to object to the evidence on these grounds below. (evid. code,  353, subd. (a); people v. redd (2010) 48 cal.4th 691, 730; people v. dykes (2009) 46 cal.4th 731, 756.) however, more specific or additional confrontation clause objections would have been futile because at the time of trial, california law allowed an expert to testify to hearsay evidence that formed the basis of the people v. gardeley (1996) 14 cal.4th 605, 617-618, disapproved by sanchez, supra, 63 cal.4th at p. 686, fn. 13; people v. stamps (2016) 3 cal.app.5th 988, 995 [sanchez people v. meraz (2016) 6 cal.app.5th 1162, 1170, fn. 7 [prior to sanchez, failure to object 26 on confrontation grounds would likely have been futile because the trial court was bound to follow pre-sanchez decisions holding , review granted mar. 22, 2017, no. s239442, opn. ordered to remain precedential; conservatorship of k.w.

(2017) 13 cal.app.5th 501, 507-508.) accordingly, duenas (iii) discussion to determine whether testimony -required by sanchez. inquiry: is the statement one made out of court; is it offered to prove the truth of the facts it asserts; and does it fall under a hearsay exception? if a hearsay statement is being offered by the prosecution in a criminal case, and the crawford limitations of unavailability, as well as cross-examination or forfeiture, are not satisfied, a second analytical step is required. admission of such a statement violates the right to confrontation if the statement is testimonial hearsay(sanchez, supra, 63 cal.4th at p. 680.) an improperly admitted hearsay statement ordinarily constitutes statutory error under the evidence code. (id. at p. 685.) where the hearsay is testimonial and is admitted in violation of crawford, the error is one of federal constitutional magnitude. (ibid.) a. background information the that regarding 27 activities; the importance of respect in gang culture; the requirements to join the gang and the difficulty of disassociating from it; and identification of tattoos as gang-related, was permissible as expert background testimony. (sanchez, supra, 63 cal.4th at p. 685; people v. iraheta (2017) 14 cal.app.5th 1228, 1247; people v. meraz, supra, 6 cal.app.5th at p. 1175; people v. vega-robles (2017) 9 cal.app.5th 382, 411-412.) for example, sanchez particular tattoo indicated gang membership was background information. (sanchez, at p. 677.) here, the evidence does not knowledge of these background facts was based on testimonial hearsay. (see meraz, at pp. 1175-1176.) and, tattoos were not hearsay. b. fi cards machucanontestifying officers indicated duenas and toro had admitted membership in the florencia 13 gang, had gang tattoos, and had been observed with other florencia 13 gang members, was hearsay. this information was case-specific, offered for its truth, and intended to demonstrate sanchez, supra, 63 cal.4th at pp. 674-675; people v. meraz, supra, 6 cal.app.5th at p. 1176 [hearsay rules barred admission other officers outside his presence, which conveyed case-specific information]; people v. lara, supra, 9 cal.app.5th at p. 337.) the people argue that s of his own gang membership were admissible as party admissions. (see evid. code,  1220.) however, this does not account for the second 28 level of hearsay, that of the nontestifying officer who reported the statement on the fi card.12 it is unclear whether the fi cards contained testimonial hearsay. sanchez did not hold they always are. (sanchez, supra, 63 cal.4th at p. 697.) statements made to officers in the course of informal interactions, and not gathered for the primary purpose of use in a later criminal prosecution, are not generally testimonial. (people v. ochoa, supra, 7 cal.app.5th at p. 585; people v. valadez (2013) 220 cal.app.4th 16, 35-36.) in contrast, if an fi card is (sanchez, at p. 697.) duenas argues the fi card information here was testimonial because information obtained by officers is for the gang affiliations, for later use in criminal prosecutions. some evidence in the record suggests otherwise: counsel for toro elicited that the majority of fi cards are filled out during consensual encounters and during the booking process. machuca testified that he had consensual encounters with gang members on a daily basis, simply to gather intelligence and build rapport. but because there was no evidence regarding the circumstances under which 12 testimony about the fi cards was harmless because the fi cards were admitted into evidence without objection. as we have explained, the failure to object below did not forfeit the confrontation clause challenge in light of the change in law wrought by sanchez. challenges all evidence of the fi cards. 29 the particular fi cards at issue were prepared, the record is insufficiently developed to allow us to determine whether the aforementioned statements were testimonial. but even assuming arguendo that the fi cards were testimonial, their admission was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. (chapman v. california (1967) 386 u.s. 18.) there was no question duenas and toro had been florencia 13 gang members in prior years; both had extensive tattoos so indicating, and both the defense and prosecution experts opined that non-gang members would be unlikely to get such tattoos. among other tattoos dueneven had the fi card testimony been omitted entirely, machuca would still have been able to testify that, based on his observations, four or five of the tattoos ocated florencia 13 membership. the only question was whether duenas was still an active florencia 13 gang member in november 2014. to this end, the fi card evidence actually favored the defense. the last fi card on duenas was prepared in 2010. the defense expert testified that the absence of fi cards on a subject during a four-year period preceding the charged crime was an indication the person had disassociated from the gang. the evidence was thus harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. c. predicate offenses to prove the requisite pattern of criminal gang activity the people must prove two predicate offenses. ( 186.22, subd. (e).) a certified copy of a minute order falls within a statutory exception to the hearsay rule, and may provide such proof. (evid. code,  452.5, subd. (b), 1280; people v. duran, supra, 97 cal.app.4th at p. 1461.) such minute orders are nontestimonial. (people v. 30 meraz, supra, 6 cal.app.5th at p. 1176, fn. 10; people v. taulton (2005) 129 cal.app.4th 1218, 1225 [records prepared to document acts and events relating to convictions and imprisonments are beyond the scope of crawford]; people v. moreno (2011) 192 cal.app.4th 692, 708, 710-711 [section 969b packet documents regarding prior convictions were nontestimonial].) as discussed above, to prove the florencia 13 gang had engaged in a pattern of criminal activity, the people presented certified minute orders showing ortega committed carjacking in november 2012, and navarro committed the offense of being a felon in possession of a firearm in may 2012. the minute orders did not indicate navarro or ortega were florencia 13 gang members or that their crimes were gang-related. instead, their gang membership was proven by detective machucthat both men were gang members. duenas argues that on this point was inadmissible testimonial hearsay. not so. detective machuca testified that both ortega and navarro were gang members. machuca did not state that his knowledge of their gang membership was based on his conversations with other detectives or review of fi cards. as far gang membership was based on his own personal knowledge. machuca testifiedand had spoken to between 100 and 150 florencia 13 gang members. also, as part of a special assignment team tasked with combating gangs, machuca spoke with gang members daily. it is therefore a reasonable testimony that navarro and ortega were florencia 13 gang members was based on his personal experience. duenas has thus failed to show that 31 testimony rested on hearsay, as opposed to information based upon his own personal knowledge. on appeal, we assume a judgment is correct and the defendant bears the burden of demonstrating otherwise.people v. thompson (2016) 1 cal.5th 1043, 1097, fn. 11.) in short, because the evidence cannot be characterized as testimonial hearsay, its admission was not error 3. sentencing issues the people and duenas contend the trial court made sentencing errors. some of their contentions have merit. a. additional facts as noted, the trial court sentenced duenas to a term of 31 years in prison, configured as follows. the court selected count 2, the criminal threats offense against galvan sr., as the principal term. it imposed the high term of three years, doubled pursuant history, the use of weapon, his prior poor performance on nd the fact the victim was vulnerable. for the section 12022.5, subdivision (a) firearm enhancement, the [sic], the indication of some degree of a vulnerable victim in this case, and membership and the it further imposed a consecutive 10-year term on the section 186.22, subdivision (b) gang enhancement, ying felony, the [section] 422, has . . . become ] 667.5, subdivision on count 1, assault with a deadly weapon on galvan jr., the subordinate term, the court imposed a consecutive term of 32 one-third of the midterm, or one year, doubled pursuant to the three strikes law, plus a consecutive three-year term for the section 12022.7 great bodily injury enhancement. b. discussion (i) imposition of both the gang and the 10-year firearm enhancement was improper duenas argues, and people agree, that the court erred by imposing both a 10-year gang enhancement and a 10-year firearm enhancement on count 2, criminal threats. section 12022.5, subdivision (a) provides that any person who personally uses a firearm in the commission of a felony shall be punished by an additional and consecutive term of three, four, or ten years, unless firearm use is an element of the offense. (people v. rodriguez (2009) 47 cal.4th 501, 505.) section 186.22, subdivision (b)(1) provides for additional punishment when a crime is committed to benefit a criminal various circumstances. (people v. rodriguez, supra, 47 cal.4th at p. 505.) section 186.22, subdivision (b)(1)(c) provides that: if the felony is a violent felony, as defined in subdivision (c) of section 667.5, the person shall be punished by an additional term (rodriguez, at p. 505.) criminal threats is a violent felony when, as here, it is charged and proved that the defendant used a firearm under section 12022.5. ( 667.5, subd. (c)(8).) section 1170.1, subdivision (f) prohibits the imposition of more than one enhancement for using a firearm in the commission of a single offense. instead, only the greatest of those enhancements shall be imposed. (people v. rodriguez, supra, 47 cal.4th at p. 508.) where, as here, a defendant is eligible for the 10-year section 186.22 punishment only because he used a 33 firearm, section 1170.1, subdivision (f) applies. the firearm use was punished under two different sentence enhancements provisions, each pertaining to firearm use, section (rodriguez, at p. 509.) the parties disagree as to whether the enhancement must be stricken entirely. the people contend the gang enhancement must be reduced to a five-year term, whereas duenas argues it must be stricken. the people have the better argument. section 186.22, subdivision (b)(1)(b) provides that if the underlying felony, as defined in subdivision (c) of section 1192.7, the person shall be punished by an additional term of five thus, the criminal threats offense qualifies as a serious felony -year enhancement is proper. people v. le (2015) 61 cal.4th 416, is distinguishable. there, the defendant was convicted of assault with a semiautomatic firearm ( 245, subd. (b)) with a section 12022.5 firearm allegation. (le, at p. 420.) our supreme court concluded section 1170.1, subdivision (f) prohibited imposition of both a gang enhancement under section 186.22, subdivision (b)(1)(b), and the firearm enhancement. (id. at p. 429.) the court found rodriguez applied, because under the relevant statutory provisions and the facts of the caseid. at pp. 425, 429.) therefore, the le enhancement . . . , regardless of whether it qualified as a serious 34 or violent felony under subdivision (b)(1)(b) or (b)(1)(c) [of section r using . . . a firearmibid.) moreover, the use of a semiautomatic firearm was a necessary element of the underlying crime. without the firearm-use element, the crime would have constituted simple assault, a nonserious felony. accordingly, the firearm element elevated the crime beyond simple assault and caused it to be listed as a serious felony, which, in turn, qualified the conduct for the five-year section 186.22 enhancement. (id. at pp. 427-428.) neither of these circumstances is present in the instant case. making criminal threats in violation of section 422 is a serious felony regardless of whether a firearm is used. the offense itself does not require the use of a firearm. thus, unlike in le, duenas was not exposed to two different sentence enhancements based on firearm use. (see people v. le, supra, 61 cal.4th at p. 428.)13 13 duenas argues that the people did not allege the criminal threats offense was a serious felony pursuant to section 1192.7, -year gang . the information alleged the gang enhancement as to the criminal threats offense and also points out that the information alleged his use of a firearm caused the offense to become both a serious felony and a violent felony. in le, the prosecutor argued that because the section 186.22 enhancement did not specifically allege the crime was a violent felony under subdivision (b)(1)(c), it was not based on use of a firearm and a 10-year firearm enhancement could be imposed. (people v. le, supra, 61 cal.4th at p. 421.) that argument is irrelevant here, and nothing in the information suggests le applies. 35 the proper remedy is not to strike one of the enhancements, but instead to reverse the judgment and remand the matter for resentencing. (people v. rodriguez, supra, 47 cal.4th at p. 509.) opportunity to restructure its sentencing choices in light of our conclusion that the sentence imposed here violated section (ibid.) this is especially true here, where we conclude other sentencing errors require modifications to the overall sentence, as explained below. when a case is remanded for resentencing by an appellate court, the trial court is entitled to consider the entire sentencing scheme. not limited to merely striking illegal portions, the trial court may reconsider all sentencing choices. [citations.]people v. hill (1986) 185 cal.app.3d 831, 834; people v. burbine (2003) 106 cal.app.4th 1250, 1258.) duenas also argues, in supplemental briefing, that he is entitled to the benefit of a new amendment to section 12022.5. effective january 1, 2018, the legislature amended section 12022.5 to give trial courts authority to strike a section 12022.5 firearm enhancement in the interests of justice. (sen. bill no. 620 (2017-2018 reg. sess.), stats. 2017, ch. 682,  1.) as amended, section 12022.5 court may, in the interest of justice pursuant to section 1385 and at the time of sentencing, strike or dismiss an enhancement otherwise required to be imposed by this section. the authority provided by this subdivision applies to any resentencing that may imposition of a section 12022.5 enhancement was mandatory and the trial court lacked discretion to strike it. (see former  12022.5, subd. (c), stats. 2011, ch. 39,  60.) 36 as the people correctly concede, the amendment to section were not final when the amendment became operative. under in re estrada (1965) 63 cal.2d 740, we presume that, absent contrary evidence, an amendment reducing punishment for a crime applies retroactively to all nonfinal judgments. (id. at p. 745; people v. brown (2012) 54 cal.4th 314, 323; people v. vieira (2005) 35 cal.4th 264, 305-306 [judgment is not final, for purposes of retroactivity analysis, until time for petitioning united states supreme court has expired].) the estrada rule has been applied to penalty enhancements, as well as to amendments giving the court discretion to impose a lesser penalty. (people v. nasalga (1996) 12 cal.4th 784, 792; people v. francis (1969) 71 cal.2d 66, 75-76.) moreover, amended section 12022.5 expressly states that the trial court has discretion to strike a section 12022.5 enhancement when resentencing occurs pursuant to any other law. this language suggests the amendment applies to crimes committed prior to the or resentencing for other reasons. as we are remanding for resentencing to ensure compliance with section 1170.1, subdivision (f), amended section 12022.5 applies.14 14 the people argue remand is unnecessary because no reasonable trial court would exercise discretion to strike the sentencing choices indicate it would not have done so here. (see people v. gutierrez (1996) 48 cal.app.4th 1894, 1896 [remand to consider striking a prior conviction pursuant to romero unnecessary when the record demonstrated the court would not have exercised its discretion to impose a lesser sentence].) but we need not decide whether remand would be necessary due to 37 ding sentencing error. (ii) great bodily injury enhancement on count 1 the parties agree that the trial court erred by imposing a full term for the great bodily injury enhancement on count 1, the subordinate term. instead, the court should have imposed one-third of the midterm, or one year. (people v. sasser (2015) 61 cal.4th 1, 9; the subordinate term for each consecutive offense shall consist of one-third of the middle term of imprisonment prescribed for each other felony conviction for which a consecutive term of imprisonment is imposed, and shall include one-third of the term imposed for any specific ].) on remand, the trial court is directed to correct this error if it exercises its discretion to again treat count 1 as the subordinate count. (iii) failure to impose serious felony enhancement the trial court failed to impose a section 667, subdivision (a) serious felony enhancement. the parties agree that this error resulted in an unauthorized sentence. when charged and proven, a section 667, subdivision (a) enhancement is mandatory, and the failure to impose it results in an unauthorized sentence. (people v. turner (1998) 67 cal.app.4th 1258, 1269; people v. dotson the amendment of section 12022.5 alone. we are remanding for resentencing in any event, and the trial court may reconsider all its sentencing choices. because section 12022.5 applies to trial court has discretion to consider striking the firearm enhancement. we offer no opinion on how it should exercise its discretion under section 12022.5, subdivision (c). 38 (1997) 16 cal.4th 547, 553.) on remand, the trial court is directed to impose the section 667, subdivision (a) five-year serious felony enhancement. (iv) imposition of upper terms, consecutive term and purported failure to consider mitigating evidence duenas argues the trial court abused its discretion by imposing the upper term on the base count and the firearm enhancement, plus a consecutive second strike sentence on count 1, given that, in his view, only one valid aggravating factor existed. the remaining factors, he urges, wduplto a jury trial under cunningham v. california (2007) 549 u.s. 270. he also contends the trial court failed to consider mitigating circumstances. a. forfeiture the people urge, correctly, that because duenas failed to raise these objections below, he has forfeited his appellate challenge. (people v. scott (1994) 9 cal.4th 331, 356.) the failure to properly make or articulate its discretionary sentencing choices. included in this category are cases in which the stated reasons allegedly do not apply to the particular case, and cases in which the court purportedly erred because it double-counted a particular sentencing factor, misweighed the various factors, or failed to state any reasons or give a sufficient number of valid reasons.id. at p. 353.) however, because duenas contends his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to object, we consider the merits of his arguments. 39 b. relevant legal principles when a statute specifies three possible terms, the choice of the appropriate sentence restroad discretion. (people v. jones (2009) 178 cal.app.4th 853, 862; people v. moberly (2009) 176 cal.app.4th 1191, 1196;  1170, subd. (b).) the court may consider aggravating and mitigating s, and may rely on the record in the case, the probation report, statements in mitigation or aggravation, and any further evidence introduced at the sentencing hearing. (people v. towne (2008) 44 cal.4th 63, 85; people v. shenouda (2015) 240 cal.app.4th 358, 368.) we discretion, which will be found only when its decision is irrational or arbitrary, or when it relied on circumstances that were irrelevant or otherwise constituted an improper basis for the decision. (people v. sandoval (2007) 41 cal.4th 825, 847; people v. carmony (2004) 33 cal.4th 367, 376.) the burden is on the party attacking the sentence to clearly show the sentencing decision was irrational or arbitrary. (carmony, at p. 376; jones, at p. 861.) although a single fact may be relevant to more than one sentencing choice, the dual or overlapping use of sentencing factors is prohibited in a variety of circumstances. (people v. scott, supra, 9 cal.4th at p. 350; people v. moberly, supra, 176 cal.app.4th at p. 1197.) a fact charged and found true as an enhancement may be used as a reason for imposing the upper term only if the court strikes the punishment for the enhancement. ( 1170, subd. (b); scott, at p. 350; people v. jones, supra, 178 cal.app.4th at p. 862; cal. rules of court, rule 40 4.420(c).) a fact that is an element of the crime upon which punishment is being imposed may not be used to impose a greater term. (scott, at p. 350; people v. kurtenbach (2012) 204 cal.app.4th 1264, 1292; cal. rules of court, rule 4.420(d).) nevertheless, the dual use of a fact or facts to aggravate both a base term and the sentence on an enhancement is not prohibitedmoberly, at p. 1198.)15 similarly, a court has discretion to consider aggravating and mitigating factors when deciding whether to impose consecutive rather than concurrent sentences. (cal. rules of court, rule 4.425(b).) however, a court may not impose a consecutive sentence based on consideration of a fact used to impose the upper term, a fact used to otherwise enhance the (ibid.) [o]ne relevant and sustainable fact may explain a series of consecutive sentences. people v. moberly, supra, 176 cal.app.4th at pp. 1197-1198.) the existence of a single aggravating circumstance is legally sufficient to make the defendant eligible for the upper term. the same is true of the choice to impose a consecutive sentence. (people v. black (2007) 41 cal.4th 799, 813; people v. osband (1996) 13 cal.4th 622, 728-729.) improper dual use of the same fact for imposition of both an upper term and a consecutive term or other enhancement does not necessitate 15 duenas points to contrary language in people v. velasquez (cannot be used to impose an upper term on a base count and an moberly has been cited favorably on this point by our supreme court. (people v. chism (2014) 58 cal.4th 1266, 1336.) 41 resentencing [i]t is not reasonably probable that a more favorable sentence would have been imposed in the absence of the osband, at p. 728.) under apprendi v. new jersey (2000) 530 u.s. 466 and cunningham v. california, supra, 549 u.s. 270, other than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be tried to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. (people v. towne, supra, 44 cal.4th at pp. 74-75.) thus, an upper term cannot be imposed based on facts that were neither admitted nor found true by a jury. c. imposition of upper terms and consecutive sentence here the trial court made three sentencing choices that duenas contends had to be supported by separate aggravating factors: (1) imposition of the upper term on the criminal threats offense; (2) imposition of the upper term on the firearm enhancement; and (3) imposition of a consecutive term on the assault offense in count 1. as the court could rely on the same factor to impose an upper term on an offense and on an enhancement, only two aggravating factors were necessary to s. to support selection of the upper term on the criminal threats offense, the court cited prior criminal history, his use of a weapon, his poor performance on probation or parole, to support its selection of the upper term on the firearm enhancementpoor performance on probation or parole, victim vulnerability, his history of gang membership, and the fact the offense involved violence. it did not give reasons for its selection of the consecutive term on the subordinate count. 42 some of the factors cited by the court were improper. duenas is correct that the trial court could not rely on the victim vulnerability factor because this fact was neither admitted nor found true by a jury. (people v. boyce (2014) 59 cal.4th 672, 728 [reliance on victim vulnerability factor improper where the fact was neither admitted nor found true by the jury, and error was not harmless]; people v. sandoval, supra, 41 cal.4th at pp. 837-838.) as the people concede, the trial court erred by relying on as an aggravating circumstance because a court may not impose an upper term based on a fact found true as an enhancement, unless the enhancement is stricken. ( 1170, subd. (b); people v. scott, supra, 9 cal.4th at p. 350; people v. jones, supra, 178 cal.app.4th at p. 862; cal. rules of court, rule 4.420(c).) the same appears to be true in , given that the section 186.22 enhancement was imposed because he committed the criminal threats offense for the benefit of the florencia 13 gang. ( 1170, subd. (b); scott, at p. 350.) but at least two of the factors cited by the court were proper. first, the court could rely on the circumstance of . imposition of an upper term sentence is permissible under cunningham when based upon the aggravatins criminal history, including the fact that his convictions are numerous or of increasing seriousness. (people v. towne, supra, 44 cal.4th at pp. 75-76; people v. wilson (2008) 44 cal.4th 758, 811-812; people v. black, supra, 41 cal.4th at pp. 819-820; cal. rules of court, rule 4.421(b)(2).) sustained juvenile petitions for assault, receiving stolen property, and narcotics possession. his adult history includes convictions 43 for possession of marijuana for sale, narcotics and marijuana possession, driving without a license, and, in 2009, second degree robbery. thus, the trial court did not err or run afoul of cunningham criminal history as an aggravating factor.16 indicates he was on probation at the time of the instant offenses. s conclusion that the charged offense was committed while the defendant was on probation or parole, like a finding of a prior conviction, does not require judicial factfinding rpeople v. towne, supra, 44 prior unsatisfactory performance on probation or parole is established by his or her record of prior convictions, it seems beyond debate that the aggravating circumstance is included within the almendarez-torrez exception and that the right to a jury trial does not 17 (id. at p. 82.) the trial court therefore could properly 16 duenas argues that his 2009 robbery conviction cannot be taken into account because it was the basis for his three strikes sentence. but the three strikes law is not an enhancement; it is an alternative sentencing scheme. (people v. frutoz (2017) 8 cal.app.5th 171, 174, fn. 3.) thus the prohibition in section 1170, subdivision (b) on using the fact of an enhancement to impose an upper term is inapplicable. duenas provides no authority holding otherwise. 17 almendarez-torres v. united states (1998) 523 u.s. 224. 44 rely on the fact duenas was on probation when he committed the current offenses as an aggravating factor.18 d. purported failure to consider mitigating factors at sentencing, duenas presented four letters written by his family and friends. he argues the trial court erred by failing to consider these materials. however, as he acknowledges, the deemed to have been considered unless the record affirmatively . rules of court, rule 4.409.) sentencing courts have wide discretion in weighing mitigating and aggravating factors, and a court may minimize or disregard mitigating factors without stating its reasons. (people v. lai (2006) 138 cal.app.4th 1227, 1258; people v. avalos (1996) 47 cal.app.4th 1569, 1583; people v. zamora (1991) 230 cal.app.3d 1627, 1637.) here, the court did not indicate any reluctance to consider the letters, and nothing in the record shows it failed to do so. of course, the trial court has discretion to reconsider any mitigating or aggravating factors on remand. 18 duenas points out that the probation report also indicates he violated probation as a juvenile in 1996. he argues that the nature of the violation cannot be ascertained from the record and therefore a jury finding was required. (see people v. towne, supra, 44 cal.4th at p. 82 [where a finding of unsatisfactory performance on probation can be established only by facts other applies].) but assuming duenas is correct, this is of no moment; the trial court could rely on the fact that the defendant was on probation at the time of the instant offense. 45 disposition the judgment is reversed as to the sentence only, and is otherwise affirmed. the matter is remanded for resentencing in accordance with the views expressed herein. not to be published in the official reports bachner, j. we concur: edmon, p.j. lavin, j. judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
