( 1170.12, subds. (a)-(d), 667, subds. (b)-(i).) defendant was sentenced to 25 years to life in count 1 pursuant to the three strikes law. the trial court dismissed one prior strike conviction for purposes of counts 2 and 3, imposing consecutive terms of two years for both counts, for a total sentence of 29 years to life. credit was given for 179 days in custody and 179 days of conduct credits, for a total of 358 days. in his timely appeal from the judgment, defendant raises the following arguments: (1) the trial court denied defendant his right to personally address the court at the time of sentencing; (2) he was entitled to custody credits of 310 days and conduct credits in the same amount under the october 2011 amendment to sections 2933 and 4019; and (3) the trial court erroneously believed it was required to impose consecutive sentences in counts 2 and 3 under the three strikes law. the attorney general argues the sentence in counts 2 and 3 was unauthorized and requests the case be remanded for resentencing. we modify the award of custody and conduct credits, remand for resentencing as to counts 2 and 3, and affirm the judgment in all other respects. facts defendant, a convicted sex offender subject to registration under section 290, received section 8 housing assistance since 2003. in his applications for section 8 assistance in 2008, 2009, and 2010, defendant falsely stated under penalty of perjury that he was not required to register as a sex offender. 1 all statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise indicated. 3 discussion i. allocution was denied his right to speak in mitigation of punishment. because defendant failed to make a timely request to testify in mitigation of punishment, the issue is forfeited. a. relevant law sentencing to make a sworn personal statement in mitigation that is subject to cross-examination by the prosecution. this affords the defendant a meaningful opportunity to people v. evans (2008) 44 cal.4th 590, 600 (evans).) the right to make a sworn statement in mitigation of punishment is forfeited if the defendant does not offer to testify before the pronouncement of judgment. (ibid.; people v. nitschmann (2010) 182 cal.app.4th 705, 708 (nitschmann).) b. background after conviction, defense counsel filed a motion for new trial, a sentencing memorandum, and a motion to dismiss prior strike convictions under people v. superior court (romero) (1996) 13 cal.4th 497 (romero). the prosecution responded with a sentencing memorandum requesting a sentence of 25 years to life. on the date of the probation and sentencing hearing, the trial court stated it had read and considered all of the paperwork filed in connection with the case. the court first addressed the motion for new trial, which was denied. 4 having disposed of the new trial motion, the trial court asked defense counsel if defendant waived time for sentence and arraignment for judgment, and whether there was legal cause why judgment should not be pronounced. defense counsel stated he would like the court to consider the romero motion. the court heard argument on the romero motion from the parties. after argument, the court engaged in a comprehensive analysis of the merits of the romero motion. the court determined that it would impose a third strike sentence of 25 years to life in count 1, but dismiss one of the strikes as to counts 2 and 3 in order to impose a second strike, determinate sentences, as to those charges. with the romero motion resolved, the trial court proceeded to impose sentence, award custody and conduct credits, impose fines and fees, and advise defendant of his c. analysis defendant failed to make a timely request to provide a sworn statement in mitigation of punishment. the trial court had ruled on the motion for new trial, the romero motion, and imposed judgment before defendant asked to speak. the issue is forfeited. (evans, supra, 44 cal.4th at p. 600; nitschmann, supra, 182 cal.app.4th at p. 708.) ii. custody and conduct credits the parties agree that defendant was entitled to 310 days of custody credits, rather than the 179 days awarded by the trial court. we order the judgment modified to reflect the correct number of days in custody. the remaining issue is the amount of conduct credits defendant should receive. defendant contended in his opening brief that under the october 2011 amendments to sections 2933 and 4019 and the equal protection analysis of in re kapperman (1974) 11 5 cal.3d 542, he is entitled to one-for-one conduct credits for each day in custody. in his vening decision in people v. brown (2012) 54 cal.4th 314, 330 (brown) is contrary to his argument, and he acknowledges that we are bound to follow the holding in brown. (auto equity sales, inc. v. superior court (1962) 57 cal.2d 450, 455.) based upon defthree strikes law, defendant was entitled to 144 days of conduct credit. we order the judgment modified accordingly. iii. correction of the sentence the attorney general contends, and defendant concedes, that the case must be remanded for resentencing. the sentence in count 1 was an indeterminate term of 25 years to life. as a result of dismissal of the one strike prior conviction as to counts 2 and 3, the sentences as to those counts must be calculated separately under the be performed separately and independently of each other. (people v. garza (2003) 107 cal.app.4th 1081, 1094.) only after each is determined are they added together to form people v. neely (2009) 176 cal.app.4th 787, 797.) the trial court sentenced defendant to an indeterminate term of 25 years to life in count 1. the court treated count 2 as a subordinate term to count 1, imposing one third of the midterm of three years (one year), doubled under the three strikes law, for a two-year term, to run consecutively to count 1. this was incorrect. the sentence in count 2 should have been treated as the principal term under the determinate sentencing law, and count 3 should have been treated as the subordinate term. we therefore remand the cause for sentencing in counts 2 and 3. 6 iv. mandatory consecutive sentences in a supplemental brief, defendant argues the trial court erroneously believed it was required by the three strikes law to impose consecutive sentences in counts 2 and 3, resulting in an abuse of discretion. we disagree. consecutive sentences were required under the facts of this case. v. consecutive sentences under the three strikes law -(i)) because he has previously been convicted of one or more serious and/or violent felony offenses ( 667, subds. there is a current conviction for more than one felony count not committed on the same occasion, and not arising from the same set of operative facts, the court shall sentence the defendant consecuhereafter sometimes subdivision (c)(6).) by implication, consecutive sentences are not mandated under subdivision (c)(6) (or subd. (c)(7)) . . . if all of the current felony convictipeople v.] deloza [(1998)] 18 cal.4th [585,] 591; [people v.] hendrix [(1997)] people v. lawrence (2000) 24 cal.4th 219, 222-223 (lawrence), fns. omitted.) here, defendant clearly did not commit his three acts of perjury on the same occasion. to the contrary, each act was part of the annual application process for section 8 housing. as a matter of law, acts occurring one year apart are not committed on the same occasion. convictions were based on independent acts of perjury by defendant. (lawrence, supra, 24 cal.4th at pp. 231-232, citing people v. durant (1999) 698 cal.app.4th 1393, 1405 [where elements of one offense are complete, a subsequent offense is not based on the 7 therefore did not arise from the same set of operative facts. (lawrence, supra, at p. 231 the trial court correctly ruled, as a matter of law, that consecutive sentences were required in counts 2 and 3. disposition the cause is remanded to the trial court for resentencing as to counts 2 and 3 under the determinate sentencing law. the trial court is directed to award custody credits of 310 days and conduct credits of 144 days. in all other respects, the judgment is affirmed. kriegler, j. we concur: armstrong, acting p. j. mosk, j.
