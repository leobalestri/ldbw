(b); count 1),1 and possession of a firearm by a felon ( 29800, subd. (a)(1); count 3). the trial court additionally found that brown personally used a firearm ( 12022.5, subd. (a)), and personally inflicted great bodily injury ( 12022.7, subd. (a)). judgment of acquittal as to the charge of attempted murder ( 664/187, subd. (a); count 2). the trial court also found the strike prior conviction and serious felony prior conviction allegations not true. 1 all further undesignated statutory references are to the penal code. 4 on june 14, 2018, the trial court sentenced brown to an aggregate term of 15 years in state prison. as to count 1, the trial court imposed the upper term of nine years. the trial court imposed the low term of three years for the firearm enhancement under section 12022.5, subdivision (a), and an additional three years for the great bodily injury enhancement under section 12022.7, subdivision (a). as to count 3, the trial court imposed the middle term of two years, and stayed that sentence under section 654. brown was given a total of 421 days of custody credit. brown filed a timely notice of appeal. discussion 1. sufficiency of evidence brown argues that the record contains insufficient evidence to support the conviction for assault with a semiautomatic firearm and the sentencing enhancement for inflicting great bodily injury. our standard of when the sufficiency of the evidence is challenged on appeal, the court must review the whole record in the light most favorable to the judgment to determine whether it contains substantial evidencei.e., evidence that is credible and of solid valuefrom which a rational trier of fact could have found the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. people v. nguyen (2015) 61 cal.4th 1015, 105 (nguyen); people v. zamudio (2008) 43 cal.4th 327, 357 (zamudio); jackson v. virginia (1979) 443 u.s. 307, 318 [i]t is the [trier of fact], not the appellate court (nguyen, at pp. 10551056.) we apply the same standard of review on a 5 challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence of an enhancement as to the sufficiency of the evidence of a conviction. (people v. carrasco (2006) 137 cal.app.4th 1050, 10571058; people v. wilson (2008) 44 cal.4th 758, 806.) is unwarranted unless it appears that upon no hypothesis whatever is there sufficient the verdict. (zamudio, supra, 43 cal.4th at p. 357; people v. manibusan (2013) 58 cal.4th 40, [we] must presume in support of the judgment the existence of every fact [the trier of fact] could reasonably . . . deduce[ ] from the evidence. (people v. zaragoza (2016) 1 cal.5th justify the findings made by the trier of fact, reversal of the judgment is not warranted simply because the circumstances might also (people v. jennings (2010) 50 cal.4th 616, 638639 (jennings).) a. assault with a semiautomatic firearm ( 240.) section 245, subdivision (b), specifically makes it a crime to commit an assault with a semiautomatic firearm. ( 245, subd. knowledge of those facts sufficient to establish that the act by its nature will probably and directly result in the application of (people v. williams (2001) 26 cal.4th 779, 790 (williams).) a defendant need only be aware of the facts that would lead a reasonable person to realize that a and probably result from his id. at p. 788.) 6 brown argues that no reasonable person would realize that adams would have been struck by a shot fired at the ground, rather than directly at him. dismissal of the attempted murder charge to support her argument. the trial court reasoned that because brown fired shots at the ground, and not directly at adams, she lacked the specific intent to kill required for attempted murder.2 this reasoning cannot apply to the offense of assault under the circumstances of this case. assault does not require a specific intent to injure a victim. (williams, supra, 26 cal.4th at p. 788; people v. trujillo (2010) 181 cal.app.4th 1344, 1352 (trujillo).) likelihood that the follows that a victim of assault is one for whom such an injury (trujillo, at p. subjectively aware of the risk that a battery (williams, at p. 788.) regardless of whether she intended to cause the injury, and 2 in finding that brown did not have the specific intent to kill, the trial court considered, among other evidence, the testimony of humphrey hyoung, an lapd detective who was a firearms expert. according to hyoung, when shots are fired lower than the specified target, either the shooter involuntarily pointed the firearm down and missed the target, or she deliberately pointed the firearm in a downward direction to avoid hitting the shots at the ground was circumstantial evidence to support either adopted the latter theory, and concluded that brown did not have the intent to kill. 7 regardless of whether she subjectively appreciated this likelihood. the evidence is undisputed that brown shot in s direction, rather than away from him. even though brown fired the shots at the ground, she still fired them in s direction at close range. any reasonable person would realize that firing multiple shots toward the ground would immediate area, either directly or by ricochet. (williams, supra, 26 cal.4th at p. 788, fn. 3.) these facts sufficiently support the conviction for assault with a semiautomatic firearm. we loaded gun in a threatening manner at another . . . constitutes an assault, because one who does so has the present ability to inflict a violent injury on the other and the act by its nature will (people v. miceli (2002) 104 cal.app.4th 256, 269.) brown characterizes her act of pointing the firearm as non-threatening. she minimizes her combined actions of chasing down adams, getting out of her car, drawing her firearm and pointing it at him. brown continually pointed the firearm at adams from when she exited her car to immediately before she fired the shots. she pointed the firearm at the ground only when she fired it. the entirety of the record demonstrates that guilt on the assault charge.3 3 t think as a matter of law that every time you point a firearm at someone it is an assault it is true that pointing, or threatening to shoot, an unloaded firearm is not an assault because the perpetrator 8 s purported lack of fear when brown pointed the firearm at him does not support a different (people v. griggs (1989) 216 cal.app.3d 734, 742.) even if under the sufficiency of evidence standard of review. (see jennings, supra, 50 cal.4th at pp. 638639.) b. great bodily injury enhancement brown next argues that substantial evidence does not support the great bodily injury enhancement because she did not personally inflict the injury to adams. specifically, brown claims that because her shot initially struck the ground and then s leg, she is only the proximate cause of its direct cause. subdivision (a) of section 12022.7 is a sentencing great bodily injury on any person . . . in the commission of a felony or ( 12022.7, subd. the direct, rather than [the] people v. elder (2014) 227 cal.app.4th 411, 418; people v. warwick (2010) 182 cal.app.4th 788, 793 (warwick).) courts have adopted the personally inflicts injury. (people v. cross (2008) 45 cal.4th 58, 68.) specifically, the phrase would lack the requisite present ability to commit violent injury. (see people v. rodriguez (1999) 20 cal.4th 1, 11, fn. 3.) however, the firearm pointed at adams by brown was loaded, as demonstrated by the discharge of two rounds from it. 9 cause[s] something (damaging or painful) to be endured. (ibid.; warwick, at p. 794; people v. slough (2017) 11 cal.app.5th 419, 423.) only indirectly responsible for s the firearm caused the bullet to discharge from the firearm. the same bullet struck adams in the leg, causing the injury. there is no distinction in the injury caused by the ricochet of the bullet fired by brown and an injury caused by a bullet directly striking adams without the ricochet. both would directly cause the injury. these circumstances sufficiently support the enhancement that brown directly and personally inflicted the injury. 2. sentencing on the firearm enhancement brown alternatively seeks remand for resentencing on the firearm enhancement in light of senate bill no. 620. effective january 1, 2018, the legislature amended section 12022.5, subdivision (c) to allow a court to exercise its discretion under section 1385 to strike or dismiss the personal use of a firearm enhancement at the time of sentencing. (sen. bill no. 620 (20172018 reg. sess.), stats. 2017, ch. 682,  1.) prior to senate bill 620, trial courts had no discretion to strike firearm enhancements under sections 12022.5. pursuant to section 1385 is reviewed for abuse of discretion. (people v. carmony (2004) 33 cal.4th 367, 375.) the defendant must affirmatively demonstrate that the trial court misunderstood its sentencing discretion. (people v. lee (2017) 16 cal.app.5th 861, 866 (lee); people v. davis (1996) 50 cal.app.4th 10 168, 172 (davis).) unless the defendant clearly shows that a sentencing decision was irrational or arbitrary, the trial court is presumed to have acted to achieve legitimate sentencing objectives, and its discretionary determination to impose a particular sentence will not be set aside on review. (people v. superior court (alvarez) (1997) 14 cal.4th 968, 977978; lee, at p. 866.) when the record shows that the trial court proceeded with sentencing on the incorrect assumption it lacked discretion, remand is required so that the trial court may have the opportunity to exercise its discretion at a new sentencing hearing. (people v. mcdaniels (2018) 22 cal.app.5th 420, 425; people v. brown (2007) 147 cal.app.4th 1213, 1228; lee, supra, 16 cal.app.5th at pp. 866867.) however, if the record is silent, we presume that the trial court was aware of the applicable law, including statutory discretion at sentencing. (lee, at p. 867; people v. gutierrez (2009) 174 cal.app.4th 515, 527; people v. mosley (1997) 53 cal.app.4th 489, 499 (mosley); davis, supra, 50 cal.app.4th at p. 172.) we cannot presume error where the record does not establish on its face that the trial court misunderstood the scope of that discretion. (mosley, at p. 496; davis, at p.172; people v. white eagle (1996) 48 cal.app.4th 1511, 1523; brown, at p. 1229.) the trial court sentenced brown on june 14, 2018. thus, by that date, senate bill no. 620 had been part of the legal landscape for over five months. we presume the parties, including the trial court, were aware of senate bill no. 620 and its newly granted discretion to strike firearm enhancements when brown was sentenced. (see mosley, supra, 53 cal.app.4th at p. 499 (sentencing court authority to strike 11 prior strike convictions presumed where romero4 decision was filed 53 days earlier).) this is not a case where a law that ameliorates punishment was passed after the defendant was sentenced. o not affirmatively show that it misunderstood, or otherwise failed to exercise, its discretion in striking the firearm enhancement. the enhancement was not a comment of the extent of its possible dioptions. accordingly, because the statements do not indicate that it was unaware of its authority to strike the enhancement, brown has failed to meet her burden of proving error. 4 people v. superior court (romero) (1996) 13 cal.4th 497. 12 disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports hanasono, j.* we concur: edmon, p. j. lavin, j. * judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
