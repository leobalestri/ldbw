(a), count 1), willfully eluding a pursuing peace officer causing death (veh. code,  2800.3, subd. (b), count 2), possession of a firearm by a felon (pen. code,  29800, subd. (a)(1), count 3), and failing to stop a vehicle involved in an accident resulting in death (veh. code,  20001, subd.

(b)-(j); 1170.12) and penal code section 667, subdivision (a)(1), and had previously served a prior prison term for a felony (pen. code,  667.5, subd.

(a)(1), immediately before arrellano pleaded no contest to the charge. 2 the parties agreed that the court would not double the sentence for possession of a firearm by a felon under the three strikes law. 3 the court awarded arrellano presentence custody credits in another case in which the court was sentencing arrellano on the same day. 4 discussion we appointed counsel to represent arrellano on appeal. after examining the record, counsel filed an opening brief raising no issues. on july 8, 2016 we advised arrellano he had 30 days to submit any arguments or issues he wanted us to consider. we have not received a response. we have examined the entire record and are satisfied that appellate counsel for arrellano has fully complied with his responsibilities and that there are no arguable issues.
