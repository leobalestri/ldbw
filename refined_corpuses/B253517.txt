it looks like you have something we want. what you got over there? alejandro then displayed a silver gun. oswaldo turned to his companions and alejandro and oswaldo started to walk crossed with them directly towards woodfin and paster. as the men approached, they spread out so that there were two to three feet between each man. the men continued to approach until they were two feet or less front of woodfin, approximately two feet away. alejandro stood very close to the car, rete stood next to alejandro. alejandro displayed his gun again and charged a round, making sure woodfin saw his actions.3 3 according to woodfin, alejandro put the loaded gun back in his pocket. according to paster, alejandro kept the gun out. 4 paster began to cry. she approached and hugged one of the men.4 the man she hugged said, to you. . paster believed they we woodfin decided he needed to take action to defend himself and paster. woodfin had a legally registered, sig sauer .40-caliber semiautomatic firearm on t. the gun contained a magazine, but did not have a round in the chamber. woodfin reached for the gun. oswaldo asked if woodfin had a weapon. woodfin put up woodfin determined that his only escape route was to exit the car, pass oswaldo, and get to the sidewalk where he could chamber a round in the gun. he grabbed his sig sauer a step to the left, chambered a round, and moved onto the sidewalk. woodfin pointed his gun at oswaldo. oswaldo stopped, put his hands up, and backed up. according to paster, alejandro then shot at woodfin. woodfin returned fire two to three seconds later, shooting three or four times as he ran from the assailants. according to woodfin, he fired first at alejandro, and alejandro returned fire. paster ducked and hid. woodfin felt a burning sensation and realized he had been shot in the hip. he headed southbound on watson avenue towards a gas station. paster caught up with him and called 911. immediately after the shooting stopped, paster saw navarrete and the two ballesteros brothers whispering together in the middle of the street. then navarrete, oswaldo, and alejandro headed northbound on watson avenue. woodfin was transported to a hospital. he had been shot once in the lower back. the wound caused nerve damage. a bullet remained lodged in his hip at the time of trial. 4 paster testified that she hugged alejandro, and may have hugged both men, whereas woodfin testified that she hugged oswaldo. 5 (ii) the investigation police recovered four spent casings of the same caliber and make as gun on the sidewalk on watson avenue. a spent .380-caliber casing, that was not fired from his gun, was found in the street in front of the hotel. a bullet fragment was found in a first floor storage room in the hotel. a trail of blood began on the west sidewalk approximately 100 feet north of the hotel. surveillance cameras interior and exterior. the surveillance footage showed navarrete and the ballesteros brothers inside the hotel, then exiting through the ce just prior to the shooting. woodfin and paster identified oswaldo as the person who asked woodfin where he was from, alejandro as the shooter, and navarrete as the third man. (iii) los angeles police department officer mark maldonado testified as a gang expert, as follows.5 navarrete was a member of the east side wilmas gang. he sported gang tattoos and used the moniker bones. alejandro and oswaldo were also east side wilmas gang members who used the respectively. the gang was predominantly hispanic. it had approximately 450 members and claimed territory in long beach. and attempted homicide, robbery, grand theft auto, weapons possession, and narcotics sales. when given a hypothetical based on the evidence in the case, maldonado opined that the assailants acted for the benefit of, and in association with, the east side wilmas where [are] you from is bgang members can more easily intimidate victims and neighborhood. the east side wilmas gang committed robberies to obtain money for the ect is of the utmost importance. a gang member who 5 the people presented additional evidence relevant to prove the penal code section 186.22, subdivision (b) gang enhancement. because navarrete does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence to prove the enhancement, we do not further detail it here. 6 failed to support fellow gang members in a confrontation or attempted robbery would be perceived as weak and disrespectful, and would be punished, including possibly being rete showed support and intimidation by standing with his fellow gang members. the statement, showed that the speaker was about to rob the victim. b. defense evidence. statements to an officer who interviewed him at the hospital shortly after the shooting.6 saw a woman, presumably paster, standing next to an african-american man, [s] near woodfin. two hispanic men were standing on the other side of the cadillac. woodfin then pulled out a gun and began shooting at navarrete, who ran toward the gas station.7 6 the defense elicited that in the hospital interview, woodfin stated that he had been seated in the back of the cadillac for approximately 20 minutes prior to the shooting; as you look like you got something i wantand woodfin did not state that he had shot from the sidewalk or that he had been looking for his insulin. 7 during cross-examination and in rebuttal evidence, the people sought to show avila had not provided some of this information to police when initially interviewed, and had become an uncooperative witness. 7 2. procedure. trial was by jury.8 navarrete was convicted of assault with a semiautomatic firearm (pen. code,  245, subd. (b)).9 the jury found the offense was committed for the benefit of, at the direction of, and/or in association with a criminal street gang within the meaning of section 186.22, subdivision (b)(1)(c). the trial court sentenced navarrete to a term of 14 years in prison. it ordered navarrete to pay victim restitution and imposed a restitution fine, a suspended parole restitution fine, a court operations assessment, and a criminal conviction assessment. navarrete appeals. discussion 1. the trial court did not have a sua sponte duty to instruct the jury on the the trial court gave caljic nos. 9.02.110 and 9.0011 on the elements of assault with a firearm. the standard version of caljic no. 9.02.1 8 to this appeal. 9 all further undesignated statutory references are to the penal code. 10 caljic no. 9.02.1, as given to the jury, provided: having violated section 245, subdivision (b) of the penal code, a crime. [] every person who commits an assault upon the person of another with a semiautomatic firearm 11 order to prove an assault, each of the following elements must be proved: [] 1. a person willfully and unlawfully committed an act which by its nature would probably and directly result in the application of physical force on another person; [] 2. the person committing the act was aware of facts that would lead a reasonable person to realize that as a direct, natural and probable result of this act that physical force would be applied to another person; and [] 3. at the time the act was committed, the person committing the 8 does not define semiautomatic firearm.12 calcrim no. 875, the successor instruction to caljic no. 9.02.1, does provide a definition of . defense counsel did not request that the trial court give calcrim no. 875 in place of caljic no. 9.02.1, nor did counsel request that caljic no. 9.02.1 be modified to further denonetheless, navarrete argues the trial court had a sua sponte duty to provide such a definition, and its failure to do so violated his federal due process rights.13 we disagree. the people urge that navarrefailure to people v. lee (2011) 51 cal.4th 620, 638.) navarrete counters that the purported instructional deficiency implicates his substantial rights ( 1259), and, if s failure to object resulted in forfeiture, counsel provided ineffective assistance. accordingly, we address the merits. (see people v. wallace (2008) 44 cal.4th 1032, 1074, fn. 7; people v. felix (2008) 160 cal.app.4th 849, 857-858.) whether a jury instruction is correct and adequate is a question of law, which we review de novo. (people v. jandres (2014) 226 cal.app.4th 340, 358.) statement of law without a request from counsel . . . (people v. lee, supra, 51 cal.4th at p. 638.) in the absence of a request for amplification, the language of a statute defining a crime is usually an appropriate and desirable basis for an instruction, as long as the jury would not have difficulty understanding the statute. (people v. santana (2013) 12 navarrete was not charged with assault with a machine gun, assault weapon, or rifle, and the trial court properly deleted these definitions from the version of the instruction given to the jury. 13 navarrete also notes in passing that caljic no. 9.02 and calcrim no. 875 navarrete to argue that the trial court erred by omittwhich is a commonplace and commonly understood term. (see generally people v. runnion (1994) 30 cal.app.4th 852, 858.) 9 56 cal.4th 999, 1007; people v. estrada (1995) 11 cal.4th 568, 574; people v. palmer (2005) 133 cal.app.4th 1141, 1156understood and is not used in a technical sense, the court need not give any sua sponte (people v. lucas (2014) 60 cal.4th 153, 296; people v. griffin (2004) 33 cal.4th 1015, 1022-1023.) on the other hand, a court does have a duty to define terms that have a technical meaning peculiar to the law. a word has a technical legal meaning requiring clarification when its definition differs from its nonlegal meaning. (people v. cross (2008) 45 cal.4th 58, 68; people v. hudson (2006) 38 cal.4th 1002, 1012.) the person of another with a semiautomatic firearm shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison fodefining machineguns, assault weapons, and bmg rifles, but does not reference or provide a definition of semiautomatic firearm. at least on the facts of this case, the trial technical definition of the term was semiautomatic firearm is not a novel concept. to the contrary, it is a commonly understood term. as we explain post, in the instant case there under these circumstances, the trial court had no sua sponte duty to provide a technical definition. the fact calcrim no. 875, the successor instruction to caljic no. 9.02.1, includes a defiinstruction was inadequate. (people v. lucas, supra, 60 cal.4th at p. 294; people v. thomas (2007) 150 cal.app.4th 461, 465-the judicial council's adoption of the calcrim instructions did not render any of the caljic instructions invalid or . . . caljic instructions that were legally correct and adequate on december 31, 2005, did not become invalid statements of the law on january 1, 2006. nor did their wording become inadequate to inform the jury of the relevant legal principles or too confusing to be understood by jurors. the judicial councils adoption of the calcrim instructions simply meant they are now endorsed and viewed as 10 superior. no statute, rule of court, or case mandates the use of calcrim instructions to the exclusion of other valid instructions.people v. thomas, supra, at pp. 465-466.) navarrete attempts to show that semiautomatic firearm does not have a commonly understood meaning. he points out that calcrim no. 875 provides the following definition: semiautomatic pistol extracts a fired cartridge and chambers a he argues that the dictionary definitions cited by the people are not precisely consistent with calcrim no. 875, or each other. (compare merriam webster online dict. <http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/semiautomatic> [as of april 29, 2015] [a semiautomatic firearm is to fire repeatedly but require[es] release and another pressure of the trigger for ] with oxford online dict. <http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/ us/definition/english/semiautomatic> [as of april 29, 2015] [a semiautomatic firearm has -argues that the definition used by the california supreme court in in re jorge m. (2000) 23 cal.4th 866, 874, fn. 4 -- fires once for each pull on the trigger and reloads automatically, but requires the shooter to release the trigger lever before another shot can was derived from a reference book that he characterizes as further, section 17140 provides, in regard to statutes not at issue here, the following definition: means a pistol with an operating mode that uses the energy of the explosive in a fixed cartridge to extract a fired cartridge and chamber a fresh cartridge with each single pull of the trigger. despite the foregoing, we are not convinced that the term has a technical legal meaning that differs from its commonplace, nonlegal meaning. nor do we think that jurors in the instant matter would have been puzzled about the definition. but even assuming arguendo that the trial court erred by failing to sua sponte provide a technical definition, the omission was manifestly harmless under any standard. (chapman v. california (1967) 386 u.s. 18; people v. watson (1956) 46 cal.2d 818, 836.) woodfin 11 united states marine corps and army, and had been trained in the use of firearms. he owned a semiautomatic handgun and knew the difference between a semiautomatic and a revolver. he explained that the loading mechanism he observed alejandro use was the same as that in his own semiautomatic. this testimony was uncontroverted. further, the defense never contended that alejanchallenged this statement, nor did she argue that alejanda semiautomatic. indeed, when the prosecutor attempted to provide additional evidence regarding the defining characteristics of semiautomatic firearms, defense counsel objected. ecutor asked tiffin to describe the difference between a semiautomatic handgun versus a revolver. defense counsel objected that the question had been asked and answered, although only woodfin, not tiffin, had previously been asked the question. the trial navarrete contends woodfinnot controlling, because woodfin identified the gun as semiautomatic on the basis that it had a slide, which is not part of any of the definitions of semiautomatic quotee complains that when the trial court asked woodfin a series of questions regarding the gun, it too focused on the existence of the slide mechanism. but the fact woodfin recognized the gun as a semiautomatic because its loading mechanism was consistent with the typical loading mechanism of a semiautomatic gun did not make his testimony less persuasive. nor are we convinced by navarreteargument that that the shooter was able to chamber a fresh cartridge with each pull of the trigger. if the jury had been properly instructed in that regard, at least one of the jurors might well have witnesses commonly identify objects without reference to their technical definitions. for example, a witness can identify a computer or a telephone without describing its inner workings. and witnesses typically testify to their observation of a firearm without 12 referencing the technical definition in calcrim no. 875 (any device designed to be used as a weapon, from which a projectile is discharged or expelled through a barrel by the force of an explosion or other form of combustion). where uncontroverted evidence supported an uncontested element, we cannot conceive how the omission of a technical definition of was prejudicial. in sum, because the instruction was adequate, the trial court had no sua sponte duty to provide a further definition. its omission rights ( 1259), and his contention has therefore been forfeited. (people v. castaneda (2011) 51 cal.4th 1292, 1347-1348.) because there was no dispute that the gun was a semiautomatic, counsel did not provide ineffective assistance by failing to request its modification. (see in re ernesto r. (2014) 230 cal.app.4th 219, 225.) finally, even assuming arguendo omission of the instruction was error, it was manifestly harmless. (see generally people v. miranda (2011) 199 cal.app.4th 1403, 1422 [any error in legal consentto give legal consent was undisputed].) 2. the evidence was sufficient to support the verdict. navarrete next contends the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction for assault with a firearm as an aider and abettor. we disagree. a. applicable legal principles when determining whether the evidence was sufficient to sustain a criminal whole record in the light most favorable to the judgment below to determine whether it discloses substantial evidencethat is, evidence that is reasonable, credible and of solid valuefrom which a reasonable trier of fact could find the defendant guilty people v. snow (2003) 30 cal.4th 43, 66; people v. houston (2012) 54 cal.4th 1186, 1215.) we presume in support of the judgment the existence of every fact the trier of fact could reasonably deduce from the evidence. (people v. medina (2009) 46 cal.4th 913, 919.) reversal is people v. bolin (1998) 13 18 cal.4th 297, 331.) the same standard of review applies to cases in which the prosecution relies primarily on circumstantial evidence. (people v. brown (2014) 59 cal.4th 86, 106.) section 245, subdivision (b)an assault upon the persoassault is defined an unlawful attempt, coupled with a present ability, to commit a violent injury on the person of ( 240.) thus, the elements of a violation of section 245, subdivision (b), are: (1) the defendant willfully committed an act with a semiautomatic firearm that by its nature would directly and probably result in the application of force to a person; (2) he was aware of facts that would lead a reasonable person to realize that his act would directly and probably result in the application of force to someone; and (3) he had the present ability to apply force with a firearm. (people v. aznavoleh (2012) 210 cal.app.4th 1181, 1183, 1186-1187; people v. golde (2008) 163 cal.app.4th 101, 108-109; calcrim no. 875.) assault is a general intent crime, and does not require a specific intent to injure the victim. (people v. wyatt (2012) 55 cal.4th 694, 702; people v. leonard (2014) 228 cal.app.4th 465, 486.) navarrete, who was not the actual shooter, was tried as an aider and abettor. a person who aids and abets the commission of a crime is a principal in the crime. ( 31; people v. smith (2014) 60 cal.4th 603, 611; people v. mccoy (2001) 25 cal.4th 1111, 1116-1117.) liability for criminal conduct is of two kinds. first, an aider and abettor with the necessary mental state is guilty of the intended crime. second, under the natural and probable consequences doctrine, an aider and abettor is guilty not only of the intended crime, but also for any other offense that was a natural and probable consequence of the crime aided and abetted. people v. mccoy, supra, at p. 1117; people v. white (2014) 230 cal.app.4th 305, 317.) here, the people advanced both theories, and the jury was instructed on both. (caljic no. 3.00 [principals defined]; caljic no. 3.01 [aiding and abetting defined]; caljic no. 3.02 [liability for natural and probable consequences].) 14 b. the evidence was sufficient to prove navarrete was liable as a direct aider and abettor. a person aids and abets the commission of a crime when he or she, (i) with knowledge of the unlawful purpose of the perpetrator, (ii) and with the intent or purpose of committing, facilitating or encouraging commission of the crime, (iii) by act or advice, aids, promotes, encourages or instigates the commission of the crime. (people v. smith, supra, 60 cal.4th at p. 611; people v. delgado (2013) 56 cal.4th 480, 486; people v. prettyman (1996) 14 cal.4th 248, 259.) among the factors that may be taken into account when determining whether a defendant was an aider and abettor are presence at the crime scene, companionship, and conduct before and after the offense. (in re juan g. (2003) 112 cal.app.4th 1, 5; people v. medina, supra, 46 cal.4th at p. 924; people v. battle (2011) 198 cal.app.4th 50, 84-criminal purpose, or the failure to prevent the crime do not amount to aiding and abetting, although these factors may be taken into account in determining criminal responsibility. (people v. garcia (2008) 168 cal.app.4th 261, 272-273; people v. nguyen (1993) 21 cal.app.4th 518, 529- question of fact, and on appeal all conflicts in the evidence and reasonable inferences people v. campbell (1994) 25 cal.app.4th 402, 409; in re juan g., at p. 5.) navarrete contends the evidence was insufficient because it showed nothing more than his presence at the crime scene. he urges that he did not say or do anything to aid and abet the assault, or to indicate his intent to do so; there was no showing he knew his fellow gang members had a gun or had planned a confrontation; and he did nothing more move from the curb we disagree with this characterization of the evidence. navarrete was not merely present at the scene; instead, he acted to facilitate the assault. navarrete and the ballesteros brothers were members of the same gang. the ballesteros brothers passed 15 gang, and woodfin was not a gang member. it was near 4:00 a.m. a few minutes later, the ballesteros brothers emerged from the hotel together with navarrete. almost immediately oswaldo issued a gang challeare cursor to violence. navarrete and stated that woodfin had something they wanted. the gang expert testified these statements indicated an impending robbery. alejandro bolstered his threat by brandishing his firearm. according to paster, alejandro held the gun aloft for at least 30 seconds. approached woodfin, who was still seated in the car. woodfin and paster immediately understood what was transpiring: paster began to cry and pleaded with the men not to , oswaldo replied, well, we do. the three assailants then stood in a row within one to three feet of where woodfin was seated. alejandro, who was next to navarrete, again displayed the gun, this time charging it. according to paster, the assailants, including navarrete, were [p]oint blank range. they were right up nexmr. [t]hey were trying to . . . stop him from getting out of the car . . . . woodfin testified: i was sitting in my vehicle, i had three individuals come up to my vehicle. t me. my only way out was my rear passenger door, to get out of the vehicle, to defend ballesteros brothers whispered together in the middle of the street. hotel, the jury could reasonably infer that the ballesteros brothers observed woodfin prior to entering the hotel; decided he was an easy target to rob, carjack, or attack, as a non-gang member in their territory; and went inside and recruited navarrete to assist in the assault. from this, the jury could have concluded navarrete knew of, and shared, their intent to commit the assault. the evidence was likewise sufficient to establish 16 navarrete acted to facilitate the crime: he approached the car and stood with his fellow presence served an important purpose, to intimidate and outnumber the victims, and encourage their compliance with whatever demands the group intended to make. the facts he did not say anything or physically accost the victim are not significant: required for aiding and abetting liability need not be a substantial factor in the offense. however slight such concern may be, for the law establishes no degree of the concern required to fix liability as a [ci(people v. swanson-birabent (2003) 114 cal.app.4th 733, 743; people v. garcia, supra, 168 cal.app.4th at p. 272.) even assuming the men did not plan the assault before exiting the hotel, the evidence was nonetheless sufficient. edge is not a prerequisite for [citationpeople v. swanson-birabent, supra, 114 cal.app.4th at p. 742.) there can be no doubt that navarrete fully understood what was transpiring early in the confrontation. as a gang member, he would have understood the significance of the gang challenge and the ents. the jury could reasonably infer , especially in light of tearful pleas not to hurt woodfin. thus, by the time navarrete engaged in his coordinated actions with his fellow gang members, he had to have known both that they intended an assault and that alejandro was armed with a gun. yet navarrete did not appear surprised himself from their conduct. instead he approached the car with them, stood with them while alejandro loaded his gun, and conferred with them after the shooting. this amounted to sufficient circumstantial evidence from which the jury reasonably could have found navarrete knew of and shared the intent to assault woodfin. (see people v. thomas (2011) 52 cal.4th 336, 355 [mental state and intent are rarely susceptible of direct proof and must be proven circumstantially]; people v. white, supra, 17 230 cal.app.4th at p. 319.) indeed, it is difficult to conceive of any other possible intent behind navarrete, despite his silence. the gang maldonado testified that gang members maintain their hold on a neighborhood by intimidating victims, and make money for the gang by committing robberies. a gang member is expected to back up his fellow gang members. maldonado explained: the life he toward the car and he walked away, they would see him as weak. that would be a sign of disrespect. . . . he shows support when standing there with [them]. he shows intimidation by standing with them. and he can later on validate, yeah, home boys, they facilitate the assault, because it benefitted him and the gang. in re juan g., supra, 112 cal.app.4th 1, is instructive. there, juan g. and quincy d. approached the victim, estevez. quincy spoke to the victim, pointed a knife at him, and demanded money. juan stood close enough to touch the victim, and the victim felt threatened by him. when the victim complied, quincy and juan fled. they were subsequently found by police walking through an empty lot. (id. at pp. 3-4.) in his defense, juan claimed he had not known quincy had a knife or was planning to rob the victim. (id. at p. 4.) the court sustained a juvenile petition against juan alleging that he aided and abetted the robbery. (ibid.he was nothing more than an unwitting and passive bystander. (id. at p. 5.) the minors approached the victim together; when quincy demanded money at knifepoint, juan was beside him; the victim felt intimidated by juan; and after the robbery the minors fled together. (ibid.; see also people v. hoang (2006) 145 cal.app.4th 264, 275-276; in re lynette g. (1976) 54 cal.app.3d 1087, 1094-1095.) case was similar. navarrete makes a variety of arguments in support of his insufficiency claim. among other things, he contends: (1) ated 18 in the assault, because paster and woodfin could have identified him; (2) because he was not armed, he could not have provided effective backup for his fellow gang members; (3) the fact he hesitated at the curb before approaching the car, and acted only in response (4) the confrontation was not preplanned, because no evidence showed the ballesteros brothers saw the victim in the cadillac before entering the hotel, and it was too dark for them to have done so; (5) ersonally navarrete to attempt to stop the assault; (6) the evidence was contradictory regarding wanted, and the use of the and (7) there was no evidence he knew alejandro had a gun before alejandro displayed it. apart from the question of whether these arguments are persuasive, they amount to a request that we reweigh the evidence on appeal. this is not the function of an appellate court. merely presented the jury with a credibility determination that is (people v. mejia (2007) 155 cal.app.4th 86, 99.) resolution of conflicts and inconsistencies in the testimony is the exclusive province of (people v. young (2005) 34 cal.4th 1149, 1181.) citation to juan h. v. allen (9th cir. 2005) 408 f.3d 1262, assist him. there juan h., a juvenile, and his brother merendon were sureno gang associates. they lived in the same trailer park as ramirez and magdelano, who were norteno associates. in the months prior to the shooting juan had made gang gestures and (id. less that two hours later, magdelano and ramirez were walking through the trailer park when they saw juan and merendon run out of sight. merendon reappeared shortly thereafter and approached the men. juan followed and stood behind merendon. when ramirez denied that he and magdelano were the shooters, merendon pulled out a shotgun and killed him. juan did not say anything, make any gestures, or otherwise encourage merendon. merendon fled and juan returned to his trailer. (id. at pp. 1266-1267.) the 19 n committed first degree murder and attempted murder, and the california supreme court affirmed without opinion. (id. at p. 1269.) the ninth circuit, however, reversed. it rejected the appellate lusion that there was evidence of flight, motive, and false alibi. (id. at pp. 1269, 1277-1278juan h. had any idea that merendon planned to assault or murder magdelano and ramirez. . . . [t]he circumstantial evidence presented does no more than establish that a rational trier of fact could conclude that juan h. knew his brother was armed and ready to confront magdelano and ramirez if the family and home of juan h. were again threatened. that juan h. stood behind his older brother after the family home had been attacked, even if he knew his brother was armed, does not permit the rational inference that he knew his brother would, without provocation, assault or murder the victims. [] . . . even if we were to assume the element of knowledge, the record does not reflect any evidence that juan h. intended, through his actions, to assist merendon in committing first-degree murder. juan h. did not do or say anything before, during or after the shootings from which a reasonable factfinder could infer an intent or purpose to aid and abet in the murder of ramirez and the attempted murder of magdelano. nor could any factfinder reasonably conclude that, by standing, unarmed, behind his brother, ding deadly force or protecting his brother id. at pp. 1278-1279.) juan h. e from nefarious plans. navarrete did not simply stand behind a relative; he coordinated his actions with the ballesteros brothers in a fashion that intimidated and cornered the victim. moreover, as our supreme court has observed, while lower federal court decisions on points of state law may be persuasive, they are not controlling. (people v. gonzales and soliz (2011) 52 cal.4th 254, 296.) 20 c. the evidence was sufficient to prove liability under the natural and probable consequences doctrine. alternatively, the evidence was sufficient to prove that navarrete was guilty on a natural and probable consequences theory. under that doctrine, an aider and abettor is guilty not only of the offense he or she intended to facilitate or encourage, but also of any reasonably foreseeable offense committed by the person he or she aids and abets. (people v. gonzales and soliz, supra, 52 cal.4th at p. 296.) an aider and abettor under the natural and probable consequences doctrine . . . must know of and is target crime (or must commit the target crime himself), and the nontarget crime must be a reasonably foreseeable consequence of that target crime. (people v. lisea (2013) 213 cal.app.4th 408, 415; people v. prettyman, supra, 14 cal.4th at p. 260 the latter question is not whether the aider and abettor actually foresaw the additional crime, but whether, judged objectively, it was reasonably foreseeable. (people v. medina, supra, 46 cal.4th at p. 920.) here the jury was instructed on the target offense of displaying a firearm or deadly weapon in violation of section 417. brandishing a weapon may be committed by drawing or exhibiting a weapon in a rude, angry, or threatening manner. ( 417, subd. (a)(1); e.g., people v. sanders (1995) 11 cal.4th 475, 542; see also people v. booker (2011) 51 cal.4th 141, 189.) as we have discussed ante, there was sufficient evidence to establish navarrete knew alejandro was armed and intended to aid and abet his confederates in confronting woodfin because he was in their gang territory, to rob or carjack him, or both. for the same reasons, the evidence was sufficient to prove navarrete was guilty as an aider and abettor of brandishing the firearm in violation of section 417. foreseeable consequence of the crime of brandishing the gun. the three gang members aggressively approached the victims at 4:00 a.m., cornering woodfin in his car, after oswaldo issued a gang challenge and alejandro made statements indicating the men intended to rob woodfin and made a 21 show of displaying and loading a weapon. it was entirely foreseeable that, in response to this clear threat, the victims would resist, and an armed victim would use a weapon in self-defense. it was not only foreseeable but almost a foregone conclusion that alejandro would fire his gun in response. (see people v. lucas (1997) 55 cal.app.4th 721, 732-733; see generally people v. medina, supra, 46 cal.4th at p. 922.) the evidence was sufficient. 3. sentencing issues after considering the probation report and the arguments of counsel, the trial court sentenced navarrete to the upper term of nine years for assault with a semiautomatic firearm, it imposed an additional five years for the section 186.22, subdivision (b) gang enhancement. a. the trial court did not abuse its discretion by sentencing navarrete to the upper term. navarrete contends the trial court abused its discretion by selecting the upper term. we disagree. imprisonment is to be imposed and the statute specifies three possible terms, the choice of the appropriate term shall rest within the sound discretion of the court. . . . the court shall seles discretion, best serves the interests of justice. thus, under current law, the middle term is no longer the presumptive term. (people v. weber (2013) 217 cal.app.4th 1041, 1063.) weighing aggravating and mitigating factors. [citation.] indeed, a trial court may people v. lai (2006) 138 cal.app.4th 1227, 1258; see cal. rules of court, rule 4.420(b).) [a] trial court is free to base an upper term sentence upon any aggravating circumstance that the court deems significant, subject to specific prohibitions. [citations.] discretion to identify aggravating circumstances is otherwise limited only breasonably related to the decision 22 (weber, at pp. 1063-1064.) a single aggravating factor will support an upper term sentence. (people v. osband (1996) 13 cal.4th 622, 728; weber, at p. 1064.) we review a trial abuse of discretion and reverse only when there is a clear showing it is arbitrary or irrational. (people v. sandoval (2007) 41 cal.4th 825, 847; people v. ogg (2013) 219 cal.app.4th 173, 185.) a trial court abuses its discretion if it relies upon circumstances that are not relevant to the decision or that otherwise constitute an improper basis for decision. (people v. sandoval, supra, at p. 847; people v. weber, supra, 217 cal.app.4th at pp. 1063-1064.) the burden is on the n was an abuse of discretion. (people v. superior court (alvarez) (1997) 14 cal.4th 968, 977-978; people v. lai, supra, 138 cal.app.4th at p. 1258.) was a factor in aggravation. (see cal. rules o probation report showed a 2008 conviction for being a gang member in possession of a firearm,report is not entirely clear, it appears this offense was a felony. (see former  12031, subd. (a)(2)(c).) on the same date, navarrete suffered a misdemeanor conviction for entering a non-commercial dwelling. navarrete suffered subsequent misdemeanor convictions in november 2008, february 2009, january 2010, and april 2010 for disobeying a court order. in each instance, navarrete was placed on probation and, except for the november 2008 conviction, also ordered to serve brief periods in jail. the trial court could praggravating factor. (see cal. rules of court, rule 4.421(b)(2); people v. stuart (2008) 159 cal.app.4th 312, 314 [six prior misdemeanor convictions wenumerous qualified as an aggravating circumstance]; people v. searle (1989) 213 cal.app.3d 1091, 1098 [three convictions for driving while intoxicated supported imposition of an aggravated term].) the record showed navarrete was a recidivist who had suffered five misdemeanor convictions and one felony conviction in the brief period 23 of two years, and failed to successfully complete probation. this factor alone was sufficient to support imposition of the upper term. nor did the trial court abuse its discretion by weighing navarreteactivity as a factor in aggravation. navarrete contends his gang membership was not an aggravating factor because mere gang membership is not criminal. (see people v. rodriguez (2012) 55 cal.4th 1125, 1130 [[m]ere active and knowing participation in a testimony that, during their numerous contacts over the years, navarrete was cordial and respectful. he also avers that he has already been sufficiently punished for his gang involvement by virtue of the five-year section 186.22 gang enhancement. 14 we discern no abuse of discretion. the record demonstrated more than mere gang membership. ober in possession of a firearm. at trial the gang expert testified regarding nine or 10 field identification cards documenting police contacts with navarrete. defense counsel successfully objected to admission of the cards, arguing, inter alia, that some included information on showcrimes being committed by mr. navarrete. in light of the foregoing, we cannot say the cal. rules of court, rule 4.420(b) [sentencing judge may consider any factor reasonably related to the sentencing decision].) victions. next, navarrete argues that the trial court abused its discretion by failing to consider mitigating circumstances. the people aver that his contentions have been forfeited because they were not raised below. (see people v. brown (2000) 14 navarrete also points to the probation report, which reiterated his statement to the probation officer that he had not been an active gang member for nine years. the trial court was entitled to disregard this self-serving statement, which was in any event belied 24 83 cal.app.4th 1037, 1041ineffective assistance by failing to raise this contention below, we consider the merits. according to navarrete, the probation report and the trial court ignored the following purportedly mitigating circumstances: (1) hcoercion or duress because, as a gang member, he could not without placing himself , as evidenced by suffers from epilepsy; (6) he has two young children, for whom he was providing; and (7) he had obtained a certification from culinary school and was employed as a forklift operator at the time of the shooting.15 none of these arguments establishes an abuse of discretion by the trial court. the fact navarrete was employed, has a culinary school certification, and has young children are not mitigating circumstances. to the contrary, they make his participation in the crime more troubling, in that he apparently had the opportunity to make an honest living and provide for his family but instead chose to participate in a serious, gang-related crime. as discussed ante, primarily comprised of misdemeanors, is not insignificant. navarrete cites no authority for the novel proposition that his choice to become a gang member, with the attendant dangers and violence, is a mitigating factor, and we do not view it as such. the record is devoid of evidence that he 15 navarrete also argues that at sentencing, the prosecutor erroneously stated the -victim was particularly vulnerable, a characterization he finds unpersuasive given that woodfin, a former u.s. marine, was armed. in his view, the probation report incorrectly stated as circumstances in aggravation that the crime was carried out with planning, sophistication, or professionalism, and that his violent conduct indicated he was a danger to society. but the trial court did not base its selection of the upper term on the juncture. 25 acted under duress, was coerced, or was induced by others to aid and abet the crime, and his contrary contentions are speculative. that he may have hesitated on the curb for a few seconds before walking towards woodfin with the ballesteros brothers does not meaningfully demonstrate coercion. while it is unfortunate he suffers from epilepsy, this circumstance was unrelated to his crimes, and the trial court was not obliged to consider it as a mitigating factor. (see people v. kelley (1997) 52 cal.app.4th 568, 582.) finally, navarrete, along with two other gang members, accosted woodfin at 4:00 a.m. without provocation and provoked an armed confrontation. while navarrete did not personally issue gang challenges or display a weapon, based on the evidence, the trial court was not obliged to characterize his conduct as passive. b. punishment. navarrete next complains his sentence of 14 years amounts to cruel and unusual punishment under the state and federal cohe the people correctly point out that because navarrete failed to raise this claim below, he has forfeited it on appeal. (people v. russell (2010) 187 cal.app.4th 981, 993; people v. norman (2003) 109 cal.app.4th 221, 229-230; people v. em (2009) 171 cal.app.4th 964, 971, fn. 5.) even if not waived, the claim lacks merit.16 whether a punishment is cruel or unusual is a question of law, but we review the underlying facts in the light most favorable to the judgment. (people v. mantanez (2002) 98 cal.app.4th 354, 358; people v. em, supra, 171 cal.app.4th at p. 971.) a punishment for a term of years violates the federal constitution only if it is grossly disproportionate to the severity of 16 because raise this contention below, fails. 26 the crime. (u.s. const., 8th amend.; graham v. florida (2010) 560 u.s. 48, 59-60; people v. carmony (2005) 127 cal.app.4th 1066, 1076.) the eighth amendment does not require strict proportionality between crime and sentence. (ewing v. california (2003) 538 u.s. 11, 23; people v. johnson (2010) 183 cal.app.4th 253, 296; people v. carmony, supra, at p. 1076.) a punishment violates the california constitution if, although not cruel or unusual in its method, it is so disproportionate to the crime for which it is inflicted that it shocks the conscience and offends fundamental notions of human dignity. (in re lynch (1972) 8 cal.3d 410, 424, fn. omitted; people v. dillon (1983) 34 cal.3d 441, 478; people v. haller (2009) 174 cal.app.4th 1080, 1092.) in making this determination, we (1) examine the nature of the offense and the offender; (2) compare the punishment with that prescribed for more serious crimes in california; and (3) compare the punishment with that given for the same offense in other jurisdictions.17 (in re lynch, at pp. 425-427; people v. em, supra, 171 cal.app.4th at p. 972; people v. martinez (1999) 71 cal.app.4th 1502, 1510.) we consider the seriousness of the crime in the abstract and the totality of the circumstances surrounding its commission, including motive, manner of commission, the extent of the defendants involvement, the consequences of his acts, and factors such as age, prior criminality, personal characteristics, and state of mind. (em, at p. 972; dillon, at p. 479; people v. felix (2003) 108 cal.app.4th 994, 1000.) a defendant must overcome a considerable burden to show a sentence is disproportionate to his or her level of culpability, and findings of disproportionality have occurred with exquisite rarity in the case law. (em, at p. 972.) navarrete has not met that burden here. the crux of his argument is that his at best, and really nonexistent; he did not have a gun or shoot the victim; he waticipant in 17 because navarrete does not address the third prong of the lynch analysis, we do not address it here. (see people v. murray (2012) 203 cal.app.4th 277, 285, disapproved on another ground in people v. gutierrez (2014) 58 cal.4th 1354, 1387.) 27 he failed to join the ballesteros brothers, he would have risked injury or death; him; and in essence, he is being punished for being a gang member. he suggests he is the real victim: eing punished for having been shot at by the victim . . . a six-foot three-inch former marine and army paratrooper with a particularly lethal handgun, while app -serving characterization of the record is unavailing. we review the underlying facts in the light most favorable to the judgment. (people v. mantanez, supra, 98 cal.app.4th at p. 358; people v. em, supra, 171 cal.app.4th at p. 971.) nothing about the circumstances of the crime suggests the sentence was unconstitutional. assault with a semiautomatic firearm is, indisputably, a serious crime. as we have discussed ante, there was ample evidence navarrete was more than a mere passive bystander. the incident resulted in the shooting of one victim, who still suffered nerve motive for the crime was either mindless gang intimidation, or attempted robbery or carjacking, neither of which suggest the sentence is disproportionate. that navarrete would have t with his fellow gang members does nothing to show his punishment is disproportionate. a defendant who chooses to join a criminal street gang, thereby intentionally placing himself in a situation where criminal activity is expected and violence is commonplace, cannot justify or mitigate his participation in a gang-related crime by complaining he had to do it or he navarrete also fails to demonstrate the punishment is disproportionate in light of his personal characteristics. he was 28 years old at the time of the offense, not an immature youth. a gang member, he had a criminal history and had failed to benefit from prior periods of probation. these facts do not lessen his individual culpability. in sum, the sentence is not disproportionate under either the state or federal constitutions. navarrete also contends the penalty is grossly disproportionate when compared with punishment in california for other, more serious offenses. in support, he urges that 28 an assailant w with a knife, inflicting great bodily injury, would receive a sentence of no more than eight years: the upper term of four years for the assault, plus one year for the use of a knife, and three years for the infliction of great bodily injury. (see  245, subd. (a)(1), 12022, subd. (b)(1), 12022.7, subd. (a).) navarrete fails to demonstrate the sentences are disproportionate. first, under california law, he was a principal in the crime; thus the fact he was not the actual shooter does little to assist him. second, the posited knife attack would not constitute a more serious crime than the instant offense. the inherent danger to human life when a gun is the weapon of choice justifies harsher penalties. (people v. gonzales (2001) 87 cal.app.4th 1, 18.) other, more serious crimes, such as murder, are punished more severely. (see  190.) third, navarrete was sentenced to nine years for the assault. a one-year difference does not demonstrate disproportionality. the additional five-year term imposed on navarrete was due to the section 186.22 gang enhancement. in sum, navarrete has forfeited his claim, and has in any event failed to demonstrate his sentence is cruel or unusual under either the state or federal constitutions. 29 disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports aldrich, j. we concur: kitching, acting p. j. lavin , j.* * judge of the superior court of los angeles county, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
