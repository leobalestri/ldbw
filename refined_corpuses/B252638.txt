(people v. ramirez (nov. 14, 2005) b176687.) the court found true allegations that he had suffered two prior serious felony convictions within the meaning of the three strikes law (pen. code,  667, subds. (b)-(i), 1170.12)1 and, on the robbery count, sentenced him to a third-strike prison term of 25 years to life, enhanced by 10 years for personal firearm use ( 12022.53, subd. (b)) and 10 years for two prior serious felonies ( 667, subd. (a)(1)).2 (people v. ramirez, supra, b176687.) in 2005, we affirmed the judgment in the case. (ibid.) on october 22, 2013, appellant filed a petition for resentencing under section 1170.126, citing his robbery conviction as the relevant third-strike offense. under section 1170.126, an inmate serving an indeterminate term as a third-strike offender may be eligible for resentencing if the current felony that resulted in the third-strike sentence was not a serious or violent felony. ( 667.5, subd. (c), 1170.126, subds. (a), (b), 1192.7, subd. (c).) the inmate will be ineligible for resentencing if, among other things, 1 further undesignated statutory references are to the penal code. 2 on the firearm possession counts, the court vacated one prior conviction finding and agreed to consider two prior convictions as one, then sentenced appellant to second-strike terms of six years on each count. one term was to run concurrently to the robbery term, and the other was stayed under section 654. the court imposed a consecutive six-month term for the first child endangerment count and a concurrent six-month term for the second child endangerment count. (people v. ramirez, supra, b176687.) 3 the inmate used a firearm in the commission of the current felony. ( 1170.126, subd. (e)(2).) the trial court denied petition for resentencing on the ground that he was ineligible for resentencing. his conviction for second degree robbery was a violent felony under section 667.5, subdivision (c)(9). further, the jury found he had used a firearm during the commission of the robbery. appellant timely appealed from the denial order.3 discussion we appointed counsel to represent appellant in this appeal. after review of the s court-appointed counsel filed an opening brief asking this court to review the record independently pursuant to wende, supra, 25 cal.3d at page 441. on march 24, 2014, we advised appellant he had 30 days within which to submit any contentions or issues that he wished us to consider. appellant filed a supplemental letter brief. he argues we should conduct a whether the evidence was sufficient to establish the alleged priors. he also asserts his current counsel is ineffective on appeal because she has not argued the evidence of his priors was insufficient. . the time for reviewing the evidence of his priors or other purported errors made at the sentencing hearing is long past. constituted the final judgment of conviction from which an appeal should have been and was taken. ( 1237, subd.
