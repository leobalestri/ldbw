(c)(1))one count for groping d. 1), one count for the incident in which defendant had vaginal and anal sex (count 2), and one count for the three subsequent incidents of vaginal sex (count 3). with respect to k., the people charged defendant with (1) one count of continuous sexual abuse for committing three or more lewd acts against a child 14 years old or younger who (pen. code,  288.5, subd. (a)) for placing his finger inside her vagina at least 10 times when she was 12 or 13 years old (count 6); (2) three counts of committing a lewd act upon a child who is 14 or 15 years old by a person who is at least 10 years older (id.,  288, subd. (c)(1)) for (a) having vaginal sex with her in the garage (count 7), (b) forcing k. to place his penis in her mouth (count 8), and (c) for placing his mouth on her vagina (count 9); (3) one count of unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor by someone at least three years older (id.,  261.5, subd. (c)) for having vaginal sex with her when she was 16 (count 10); and (4) one count of sexual penetration by a foreign object on a minor (id.,  289, subd. (h)) for placing his finger inside her vagina near her 17th birthday (count 11). 2 this information charged a 14th crime as well (count 4), but the trial court dismissed it as beyond the statute of limitations. 5 with respect to amina, the people charged defendant with committing a lewd act upon a child under the age of 14 (pen. code,  288, subd. (a)) (count 5). with respect to monique, the people charged defendant with (1) one count of continuous sexual abuse (pen. code,  288.5, subd. (a)) for groping her breasts and buttocks at least 10 times when she was 12 and 13 years old (count 12); (2) one count of committing a lewd act upon a child who is 14 or 15 years old by a person who is at least 10 years older (id.,  288, subd. (c)(1)) for inserting his fingers and tongue in her vagina on numerous occasions (count 13); and (3) one count of forcible rape (id.,  261, subd. (a)(2)) for having vaginal sex with monique when she was 15 years old (count 14). the people further alleged that defendant had committed these crimes against multiple victims within the meaning of our one strikeaw. (pen. code,  667.61, subds. (b) & (e).) convictions in 1981, 1985, law (id.,  667, subds. (b)-(j) & 1170.12, subds. (a)-felonies (id.,  667, subd. (a)(1)), and constituted prior prison terms (id.,  667.5, subd. (b)(1)). defendant moved to sever the counts involving d. from the case involving the crimes against d. might spill over to the weaker cases involving the other girls. the trial court denied the motion, finding joinder appropriate because the evidence involving each victim was admissible against the others and noting the hardship upon d. if she had to testify in multiple trials. the matter proceeded to a jury trial. defendant took the stand, admitted that he had sex with d. twice and that he was the father of her child. he denied all of the other allegations. 6 the jury found defendant guilty of all charged crimes and found true the multiple victim allegation. the trial court sentenced defendant to prison for 447 years and 4 months. more specifically, the court imposed a sentence of 25 years to life on counts 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, 11, and 13; a sentence of 60 years to life on counts 5 and 14 (calculated as a base sentence of 15 years to life tripled under penal code section 667.61, plus three five-year sentences for the three prior serious felonies); a sentence of 63 years to life on counts 6 and 12 (calculated as a base sentence of 16 years to life tripled under penal code section 667.61, plus three five-year sentences for the three prior serious felonies); and a sentence of 16 months on count 10 (calculated as one-third the midterm sentence of 24 months, doubled as a second strike). defendant filed this timely appeal. discussion defendant argues that his convictions must be reversed because the trial court erred (1) in denying his motion to sever for trial the counts involving d. from the remaining counts, and (2) in instructing the jury that it could consider each of the counts as evidence of his propensity to commit the other counts. because our resolution of the second issue impacts the first, we will begin with the second issue. also, the people argue that the trial court erred in failing to impose two mandatory statutory fees. i. charged counts as propensity evidence although evidence that a criminal defendant has the propensity or disposition to engage in certain conduct is ed people v. villatoro (2012) 54 cal.4th 1152, 1159 (villatoro);  1101, subd. (a)), section 1108 is an exception to this [a] disposition to 7 reasonare substantial corrobors this evidentiary gap. (people v. falsetta (1999) 21 cal.4th 903, 915 (falsettaanother ose offense(s) are charged. (see people v. reliford (2003) 29 cal.4th 1007, 1012-1013 [uncharged]; villatoro, at pp. 1160-1169 [charged].) in all cases, however, the trial court must decide under section 352 whether the probative value of the other sexual offense(s) is 352 & 1108, subd. (a).) although we review jury instructions de novo (people v. manriquez (2005) 37 cal.4th 547, 581), the propriety of the instructions ruling, which we review for an abuse of discretion (people v. clark (2016) 63 cal.4th 522, 597). in this case, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that each of the charged sex crimes was admissible under scommit the other charged sex crimes. each of the charged sex aning of section 1108. ( 1108, subd. (d)(1)(a) [covered offenses include violations of pen. code,  261, 261.5, 288, 288.5 & 289].) moreover, the trial court, in deciding whether to instruct the jury that it could consider the charged offenses as evidence of section 352 and found that the [e] . . . and would not result in the further, the court was careful to instruct the jury that it could, 8 to commit sex acts from his commission of a charged offense; that it could only do so if it first found beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant committed that offense; one was to t separately.3 under our supreme villatoroevidentiary ruling and jury instructions were proper. defendant levels four arguments at this conclusion. first, he argues that villatoro was wrongly decided because a viable section 352 analysis is critical to the constitutionality of section 1108 (falsetta, supra, 21 cal.4th at pp. 917-918), and because the three concurring and dissenting justices in villatoro expressed their view that it is impossible to conduct a viable section 352 analysis with respect to a charged offense. (villatoro, supra, 54 cal.4th at pp. 1176-1178 (conc. & dis. opn. of corrigan, j.); id. 3 in full, the court instructed the jury using calcrim nos. 1191 and 35committed one of these charged offenses, you may, but are not required to, conclude from that evidence that the defendant was disposed or inclined to commit the other charged crimes, and based on that decision also conclude that the defendant was likely to and did commit the other offenses charged. [] if you conclude that the defendant committed a charged offense, that conclusion is only one factor to consider along with all the other evidence. [] it is not sufficient by itself to prove the defendant is guilty of another charged offense. [] the people must still prove each element of every charge beyond a reasonable doubt and prove it beyond a reasonable doubt before you may consider one charge as peach of the counts charged in this case is a separate crime. you must consider each count separately and return a separate (calcrim no. 3515.) 9 at pp. 1183-1185 (conc. & dis. opn. of liu, j.).) the majority opinion disagreed, reasoning that a trial court may consider ection 352 factors when deciding whether to permit the jury to id. at p. 1163.) we are bound to auto equity sales, inc. v. superior court (1962) 57 cal.2d 450, 456.) defendant relatedly asserts that villatoro contradicts federal law interpreting the federal analogue to section 1108 (see u.s. v. castillo (10th cir. 1998) 140 f.3d 874, 884), but we are, again, required to follow the law set down by our supreme court. second, defendant contends that villatoro has been displaced by people v. cottone (2013) 57 cal.4th 269, and that villatoro does not apply when all of the victims know each other. he is wrong on both counts. cottone held that a trial court may admit, under section 1108, an uncharged sexual offense committed by the defendant when he was a minor only if the court first determines, by clear and convincing evidence, that the defendant had the capacity at the time of the prior offense to understand that his conduct was wrongful. (cottone, at pp. 286-287.) nothing in cottone casts any doubt upon villatoros continued vitality. in a similar vein, dargument that villatoro is unconstitutional whenever the victims know each other and thus could engage in a global conspiracy to lie finds no support in villatoro. defendant cites people v. harris (1998) 60 cal.app.4th 727, 738-740, but that case simply held it was error to admit evidence of an uncharged, 23-year-old violent to commit emotionally and physically vulnerable who were not strangers to the defendant. what is more, nspiracy to implicate him in sex crimes he did not commit is substantially undermined by his own admission that he committed sex crimes against one of the victims (namely, d.). 10 third, defendant asserts it is improper to prove propensity with a charged offense because the people only need probable cause to charge an offensenot proof beyond a reasonable doubt. this argument overlooks that the trial court here specifically instructed the jury that it could only infer propensity from a charged offense if it first found beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant committed that offense. lastly, defendant contends that section 1108 should be valid only if the trial court expressly places its section 352 analysis on the record. this contention is not only inconsistent with binding law directly on point (villatoro, supra, 54 cal.4th at p. 1168 [upholding use of charged offenses to prove propensity even though trial court did not expressly weigh  352 factors]; people v. taylor need not expressly weigh prejudice against probative value or even expressly state that it has done sobut also ignores that the court in this case did engage in a section 352 analysis on the record. in sum, the trial court properly instructed the jury that it propensity to commit the other charged sex offenses. ii. severance offenses coffenses is nevertheless intereare common element of substantial importance. [citations.](people v. landry (2016) 2 cal.5th 52, 76 (landry).) two offenses [citations.]ibid.) if crimes are eligible to be joined 11 for trial, the good cause requirement obligates a defendant to arising from the joinder. (people v. armstrong (2016) 1 cal.5th 432, 456 (armstrong), quoting alcala v. superior court (2008) 43 cal.4th 1205, 1220 (alcala)landry, at p. 75.) we engage in a two-t of the information available at the time [of the decision], the trial court abused its discretion in after t joinder actually resulted gross unfair amounting to a denial of defendaconstitutional right to people v. simon (2016) 1 cal.5th 98, 122, 129 (simon), quoting people v. merriman (2014) 60 cal.4th 1, 46 (merriman).) the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying otion to sever the charges involving d. from the charges involving his three other victims based on the information the court had at the time of the denial. all of the charged crimes were eligible for joinder: not only were they of merriman, supra, 60 cal.4th at pp. 36-37 [sex crimes are of the same class]; people v. ochoa (1998) 19 cal.4th 353, 409 [same]common element[s] of substantial importance (landry, supra, 2 cal.5th at p. 76). namely, the offenses were all committed against young, smaller girls to whom defendant had access when those girls were alone and over their repeated objections, and defendant used threats to keep all but one of his victims quiet. that would have rebutted the statutory presumption that the eligible offenses should be joined. (armstrong, supra, 1 cal.5th at p. 456.) the threshold consideration is whether the evidence used to prove one offense is admissible to prove the others, and 12 vice versa. (ibid.; people v. soper (2009) 45 cal.4th 759, 774-775 (soper)-admissibility (people v. ochoa (2001) 26 cal.4th 398, 423; cf. pen. code,  954.1 [absence of cross-admissibility does not preclude joinder]; frank v. superior court -admissibility is not the sine -admissibilisufficient, standiand hence no prejudicearising from evidence to be heard by the jury is inadmissible as to at least one of the alcala, supra, 43 cal.4th at p. 1221; people v. earle (2009) 172 cal.app.4th 372, 387-388 (earle).) for the reasons described above, the evidence regarding the offenses involving k., monique, and amina was cross-admissible as propensity evidence under section 1108 to prove the offenses involving d., and vice -admissibility of the evidence were not enough, the other factors counseling against joinder are not present. when evidence is not cross-admissible, courts also to inflame the jury against the defendant; (2) whether a weak case has been joined with a strong case or another weak case so that the totality of the evidence may alter the outcome as to some or all of the charges; or (3) whether one of the charges (but not soper, supra, 45 cal.4th at p. 775.) simon, supra, 1 cal.5th at p. 124; williams v. superior court (1984) 36 cal.3d 441, 452 [terming them on other grounds by pen. code,  954.1), the danger that the jury will transfer its outrage arising from a highly inflammatory charge to a less inflammatory 13 one is not present when all charges are equally inflammatory (people v. marshall (1997) 15 cal.4th 1, 28). all of the charges here are sex crimes against children; none is demonstrably more inflammatory than the others. this is also not a case where strong evidence of a lesser but inflammatory crime might be used to bolster a weak [citation.]people v. capistrano (2014) 59 cal.4th 830, 850.) the evidence of e of the victim identifying defendant as the perpetrator after knowing him for years and, except for amina, after he sexually assaulted (earle, supra, 172 cal.app.4th at p. 401 [a case based on a i[evidence that defendant committed crimes against d. was even stronger in light of the dna evidence identifying defendant as the father of d.defendant to admit that the child was his. but this is an instance of a strong case against defendant involving k., monique, and amina paired with an even stronger case involving d.; it is not an instance of a strong case being paired wialways is possible to point to individual aspects of one case and argue that one is stronger than the (soper, supra, 45 cal.4th at p. 781.) the final factor is irrelevant because none of the charged crimes is a capital offense. defendant has also not demonstrated that the trial that rising to the level of a denial of due process. (simon, supra, 1 cal.5th at p. 129.) as noted above, the evidence of the sex crimes against each victim was cross-admissible; the trial court carefully circumscribed the conditions under which the 14 jury could infer propensity from the commission of each offense; e was overwhelming. there was no denial of due process. defendant raises three further arguments in response. first, he likens his case to earle, supra, 172 cal.app.4th 372. in earle, the court held it was error not to sever an indecent exposure count from an assault count where the evidence as to one count was not cross-admissible to the other, where the into believing the defendant here the evidence of the the indecent exposure count was strong but the evidence of his guilt as to the assault was weak. (id. at pp. 400-407.) for the reasons described above, none of these rationales is present in this case, let alone all three. second, defendant asserts that the trial court was wrong, when denying the motion to sever, in placing any weight on the hardship to d. in having to testifying in multiple trials; according to defendant, the only hardship that matters is the hardship to him. we disagree. the hardship on d. is an aspect of the judicial economy arising from joinder, which is to be weighed against the prejudice to defendant; the hardship on d. is not irrelevant. more to the point, we are reviereasoning (e.g., cruz v. sun world internat., llc (2015) 243 cal.app.4th 367, 373); its result is correct for the reasons we set forth above. lastly, defendant notes that the charged crimes took place over a large span of years. this is true, but does not affect any of the analysis set forth above. iii. fees the people argue the trial court orally imposed a $30 criminal conviction assessment (gov. code,  70373) and a $40 15 court security fee (pen. code,  1465.8) for each of the 13 counts, but that the abstracts of judgment reflect the imposition of those fees for three counts. the people are correct, and we may correct (people v. castellanos (2009) 175 cal.app.4th 1524, 1530.) because the assessment and fee were due on each count of conviction, we order the clerk of the superior court to prepare amended abstracts of judgment that reflect a total of $390 in criminal conviction assessments and $520 in court security fees. (people v. chan (2005) 128 cal.app.4th 408, 425-426.) disposition the abstracts of judgment are modified as follows: a $30 criminal conviction assessment pursuant to government code section 70373, subdivision (a) should be imposed for each count, for a total of $390; and a $40 court security fee pursuant to penal code section 1465.8 should be imposed for each count, for a total of $520. as modified, the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. ______________________, j. hoffstadt we concur: _________________________, acting p. j. chavez _________________________, j.* goodman * retired judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
