[] 3. where she is prevented from resisting by threats of great and immediate bodily harm, accompanied by apparent power of execution, or by any intoxicating narcotic, or anesthetic, substance, administered by or with the privity of the accusedwill refer to the correct designation, i.e., former penal code section 261, subdivision 3, petition is based on the statutory language of former penal code section 261, subdivision 3. finally, we note the threats required by former penal code section 261, subdivision 3 could be proved by conduct. (people v. hunt (1977) 72 cal.app.3d 190, 194.) 4 violation of former penal code section 261, subdivision 3. the prior conviction was alleged as a strike along with other alleged strikes. the petition also contains copies of court documents reflecting the following occurred on february 7, 1997. a jury convicted appellant of committing, in 1995, the present offense, i.e., a violation of penal code section 666. the trial court in the present case found true four strike allegations, including the one based on the rape conviction in case no. a554778. the trial court, pursuant to the three strikes law, sentenced appellant to prison for 25 years to life for the present offense. 3. as mentioned, on october 14, 2014, appellant filed his petition. in the petition, appellant argued, inter alia, his 1976 rape conviction in case no. a554778 did not render him ineligible for proposition 36 relief. appellant acknowledged a conviction for aiding and abetting committed by force, violence, duress, menace, [or] fear of immediate within the meaning of welfare and institutions code section 6600, subdivision (b), was a conviction for a within the meaning of that subdivision with the result such a conviction would render a defendant ineligible for proposition 36 relief. (pen. code,  1170.126, subds. (e)(3) & (f), 667, subd. (e)(2)(c)(iv)(i), 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(c)(iv)(i); welf. & inst. code,  6600, subd. (b).) however, appellant argued, inter alia, that given the statutory language of former penal code section 261, subdivision 3, viewed in the abstract, the rape at issue could have been an act of sexual intercourse where michelle s. prevented from resisting . . . by any intoxicating narcotic, or anesthetic, substance, administered by or with the privity of the accusedsubdivision 3. if so, appellant further argued, the resulting rape was not necessarily a rape bodily injury on the within the meaning of welfare and institutions code section 6600, subdivision (b); therefore, appellant was not, within the meaning of that 5 subdivision, convicted of proposition 36 relief. however, the trial court in the present case, in a written memorandum of decision filed on december 8, 2014, concluded it was not governed merely by the statutory language of former penal code section 261, subdivision 3, in the abstract. instead, the trial court, relying on, inter alia, people v. manning (2014) 226 cal.app.4th 1133, concluded it could look to the record of conviction in case no. a554778, and, in particular, to the transcript of the guilty plea in that case, to determine the substance and circumstances of the conduct underlying the rape conviction when evaluating whether it rendered appellant ineligible for proposition 36 relief. the trial court in the present case ruled the guilty plea transcript in case no. a55477clearly establishethe court relied on the following colloquy that occurred during the taking of the guilty plea: . . . [count viii of the consolidated information alleged] . . . you did aid and abet daryl clisby to accomplish an act of sexual intercourse . . . and that you did so and prevented you aided mr. clisby in having this act of sexual intercourse by threats against michelle [s.]. [] to that charge of forcible rape on the theory of aiding and abetting, how do you now plead? . . . [] (second, third, and fourth italics added.) the trial court in the present case demonstrates defendant was convicted of aiding and abetting a rape by threatening the victim, which necessarily constitutes force or duress based on the definition of a sexually violent offense pursuant to welfare and institutions code section 6600, subdivision (b). indeed, rape by duress includes an act that is accomplished by a direct or implied threat. ([pen. code,]  accordingly, the trial court denied the petition with prejudice ed him ineligible for relief under proposition 36. on december 22, 2014, appellant filed a notice of appeal. 6 contentions after examination of the record, appointed appellate counsel filed an opening brief which raised no issues and requested this court to conduct an independent review of the record. by notice filed march 20, 2015, the clerk of this court advised appellant to submit within 30 days any contentions, grounds of appeal, or arguments he wished this court to consider. no response has been received to date. review on appeal we have examined the entire record and are satisfied counsel has complied fully smith v. robbins (2000) 528 u.s. 259, 278-284; people v. wende (1979) 25 cal.3d 436, 443.) 7 disposition the order denying with prejudice l of sentence is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports kitching, acting p. j. we concur: aldrich, j. egerton, j. * judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
