(a)). t described the circumstances of the crimes: after law enforcement officers received information stanton had recently cashed several fraudulent checks at a bank, they arrested him at the bank while he was attempting to cash another fraudulent check.2 the amount of the individual checks reportedly ranged from $180 to $540. pursuant to a plea agreement, stanton pleaded no contest to the burglary count, and the trial court dismissed the forgery count. the court sentenced stanton to 16 months in prison. in november 2014 california voters approved proposition reduced certain drug-related and theft-related offenses 1 statutory references are to the penal code. 2 the report does not specify in what sense the checks were ed [stanton] 3 that previously [i.e., crimes chargeable or punishable as either a felony or a misdemeanor] to misdemeanors. [citation.] it also enacted a procedure permitting inmates who are serving felony sentences for offenses that proposition 47 reduced to misdemeanors to petition to have their felony convictions reclassified as misdemeanors and to be resentenced based on the reclassification.people v. valencia (2017) 3 cal.5th 347, 351; accord, people v. morales (2016) 63 cal.4th 399, 404.) in september 2015 stanton petitioned for recall of his sentence and for resentencing under proposition 47 ( 1170.18, subd. (a)), contending proposition 47 reduced his felony second degree burglary offense to a misdemeanor. in particular, proposition 47 added section 459.5, which provides: defined as entering a commercial establishment with intent to commit larceny while that establishment is open during regular business hours, where the value of the property that is taken or intended to be taken does not exceed nine hundred fifty dollars s that, with ibid.) at the parties agreed and the trial court found with the intent to cash a forged check in an amount less than $950. the trial court concluded, however, to cash the forged check was not an intent to commit larceny, as required by the in section 459.5, but an intent to commit a fraud. the court therefore ruled proposition 4 47 did not reduce sta, determined he was not eligible for relief under proposition 47 for that reason, and denied his petition. stanton timely appealed. discussion stanton argues the trial court erred in denying his petition because the requirement of ain the in section 459.5 includes an intent to commit theft by, as stanton did here, entering a bank to cash a forged check. review is de novo. (see people v. salmorin (2016) 1 cal.app.5th 738, 743 e review the trial courts construction of proposition 47 de novo while this appeal was pending, the supreme court decided gonzales, supra, 2 cal.5th 858. at our request, the parties submitted supplemental briefing to address the effect of gonzales on this appeal. we agree with the parties that gonzales controls. in gonzales, the supreme court held that, because electorate . . . intended that the shoplifting statute apply to an entry to commit a nonlarcenous theft,the s act of entering a bank to cash a stolen check for less than $950, traditionally regarded as a theft by false pretenses rather than larceny, now (gonzales, supra, 2 cal.5th at p. 862.) among other considerations, the supreme court reasoned that section 459.5 must be construed in light of section 490a, which provides that, [w]herever any law or statute of this state refers to or mentions larceny, embezzlement, or stealing, said law or statute shall hereafter be read were substituted therefor.gonzales, supra, 2 cal.5th at pp. 868-5 870.) the supreme court concluded the electorate intended which included the a stolen check he made out to himself for $125 and signed without authorization. (gonzales, at pp. 862, 869; see  484 [defining theft].) the supreme court also stated, a defendant must be charged only with shoplifting when [section 459charging and ensures only misdemeanor treatment for the gonzales, at p. 876; see  459.5, subd. (b).) gonzales s was identical in all material respects gonzales: he entered a bank with the intent to cash a forged check in an amount of $950 or less. proposition 47, as interpreted by the supreme court in gonzales, reduced that offense to the misdemeanor offense of shoplifting. (gonzales, supra, 2 cal.5th at pp. 876-877.) therefore, the trial -gonzales ruling to the contrary and denial of . it is not clear from the record, however, whether stanton is entitled to relief under proposition 47 and, if so, what kind of relief. under section 1170.18, subdivision (a), [a] person currently serving a sentence for a conviction, whether by trial or plea, of a felony or felonies who would have been guilty of a misdemeanor under the act that added this section () had this act been in effect at the time of the offense may petition for a recall of sentence before the trial court that entered the judgment of conviction in his or her case to request resentencing the statutes amended or added by proposition 6 47. if the petitioner meets the criteria in subdivision (a) of section shall be recalled and the petitioner resentenced to a misdemeanor . . . unless the court, in its discretion, determines that resentencing the petitioner would pose an unreasonable r(people v. bastidas (2017) 7 cal.app.5th 591, 595-596 (bastidas) quoting  1170.18, subds.

(f), (g)].) 7 stanton petitioned for recall and resentencing under section 1170.18, subdivision (a). as discussed, the trial court erred in denying that petition on the ground proposition 47 did not reduce his offense to a misdemeanor. but the record does not demonstrate stanton was necessarily entitled to resentencing. for one thing, it is unclear whether r the underlying offense. ( 1170.18, subd. (a).) the trial court sentenced him in december 2009 to 16 months, and stanton filed his petition in september 2015. in addition, even if stanton were eligible for resentencing under subdivision (a), the trial court did not reach the question whether it should nevertheless deny his petition under subdivision (b) on the ground resentencing him would pose an unreasonable risk of 1170.18, subd. (b).) finally, it may be that stanton has already completed his felony sentence and is entitled to have his felony conviction designated as a misdemeanor under section 1170.18, subdivisions (f) and (g). the people appear to suggest this is the case when they state therefore, we remand for a determination whether stanton is entitled to any relief under section 1170.18. 8 disposition the order is reversed, and the matter is remanded for a determination whether, in light of our holding proposition 47 he is entitled to any relief under section 1170.18. segal, j. we concur: perluss, p. j. menetrez, j.* *judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
