(pen. code,  470, subd. (d).)1 at the time, defendant was also on probation on another matter, los angeles superior court, case no. la070094, and therefore her plea resulted in a probation violation in that case. the trial court sentenced defendant to a total term of two years eight months in county jail, comprised of the midterm of two years for her current case, plus an additional and consecutive eight months for the probation violation in case no. la070094. execution of that sentence was suspended and defendant was placed on three years of probation subject to various terms and conditions. condition which required her department all electronic mail accounts and internet accounts for access, all passwords and access codes to financial institutions (electronic search probation condition).2 defendant did not object 1 all further statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise indicated. 2 condition was limited to defendant only providing her internet 3 to this probation condition when it was imposed and did not appeal her sentence. in january 2017, the probation department indicated defendant was in violation of her probation for failing to complete 90 days of probation adult alternative work services (p.a.a.w.s.). tion and issued a warrant for her arrest. defendant was picked up on the bench warrant, and a probation violation hearing was scheduled for january 31, 2018. following a contested hearing, the trial court concluded defendant was in violation of her probation for failing to complete p.a.a.w.s. a two-year sentence.3 that same date, defendant filed a notice of appeal. defendant passwords to the probation officer. given our ruling, we need not resolve this issue. 3 defendant already had custody credits for the eight-month sentence imposed in case no. la070094 (probation violation). thus, at the january 31, 2018 hearing, the trial court reinstated and terminated case no. la070094. 4 discussion defendante electronic search probation condition violated her right to privacy under the fourth amendment and was unconstitutionally overbroad. we need not appeal is untimely. . . . must be filed within 60 days after the rendition of the judgment or the making of the order being (cal. rules of court, rule 8.308(a).) [citation.] it largely divests the superior court of jurisdiction and vests it in the court of appeal. [citation.] an the delay cannot be waived, it cannot be cured by nunc pro tunc order, and the appellate court has no power to give relief, but must dismiss the [citation.] the purpose of the requirement of a timely notice of appeal is, self-evidently, to further the finality of judgments by causing the defendant to take an appeal expe (people v. mendez (1999) 19 cal.4th 1084, 1094 (mendez).) an order granting probation is an appealable order. ( 1237, subd. (a); people v. ramirez (2008) 159 cal.app.4th 1412, 1421 (ramirez).) ot to appeal an order granting or modifying probation cannot raise claims of error with respect to the grant or modification of probation in a later appeal from a judgment following revocation of probation. (ramirez, supra, at p. 1421.) here, the trial court imposed the electronic search probation condition on may 14, 2014. although defendant could have appealed and challenged 5 the condition within 60 days after it was imposed, she did not do so. (cal. rules of court, rule 8.308(a).) thuschallenge to the electronic search probation condition is untimely. recognizing this problem, defendant contends her appeal must still be heard because an exception to the rule applies when an appeal is based on a constitutional issue. on people v. munoz (1975) 51 cal.app.3d 559, 563 and people v. silva (1966) 241 cal.app.2d 80, 8283 for this proposition is without merit. neither of these cases hold that the 60-day time limit to appeal is excused for constitutional arguments. and both cain mendez, which made clear that a timely notice of appeal is essential to appellate jurisdiction cannot be waived, it cannot be cured by nunc pro tunc order, and the appellate court has no power to give relief.mendez, supra, 19 cal.4th at p. 1094.) accordingly, the appropriate disposition in this case is dismissal. disposition the appeal is dismissed. _______________________, ashmann-gerst, j. we concur: ________________________, p. j. lui ________________________, j. hoffstadt
