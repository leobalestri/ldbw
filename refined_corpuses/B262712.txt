filed 5/25/16 p. v. zazueta ca2/4 not to be published in the official reports california rules of court, rule 8.1115(a), prohibits courts and parties from citing or relying on opinions not certified for publication or ordered published, except as specified by rule 8.1115(b). this opinion has not been certified for publication or ordered published for purposes of rule 8.1115. in the court of appeal of the state of california second appellate district division four the people, plaintiff and respondent, v. sebastian zazueta, defendant and appellant. b262712 (los angeles county super. ct. no. va131976) appeal from a judgment of the superior court of los angeles county, robert j. higa, judge. affirmed. laura s. kelly, under appointment by the court of appeal, for defendant and appellant. kamala d. harris, attorney general, gerald a. engler, chief assistant attorney general, lance e. winters, senior assistant attorney general, shawn mcgahey webb and nathan guttman, deputy attorneys general, for plaintiff and respondent. 2 a jury convicted appellant sebastian zazueta of one count of murder (pen. code,1  187, subd. (a)), and four counts of attempted murder ( 664/187, subd. (a)), with firearm allegations found true as to each count ( 12022.53, subds. (b)(d).) the trial court sentenced him to state prison for 50 years to life, 25 years to life for count 1, plus an additional 25 years to life for the firearm allegation; consecutive terms for counts 2 and 3, and concurrent terms of life plus 25 years to life for counts 4 and 5. on appeal, he contends that the trial court erred in using caljic no for attempted murder. he also contends that the prosecutor committed misconduct, or in the alternative that he received ineffective assistance of counsel based on and affirm. factual background on september 21, 2013, appellant attended a concert at the el rodeo hinojosa, who was celebrating his birthday. the group rode to the concert in was left with one of the four valets2 working the club that 1 undesignated statutory references are to the penal code. 2 the four valets working at the el rodeo nightclub that evening were: ramiro barajas, juan ruiz, oscar cortez because two valets share a surname, we refer to them by their first names, not out of disrespect but for the sake of clarity and convenience. (see cruz v. superior court (2004) 120 cal.app.4th 175, 188, fn. 13.) none of the valets was armed. 3 night. they separated after paying their entrance fees. appellant was not drinking before the group got to the club. zaldivar testified that, except for stopping by their table for an occasional drink, appellant spent no time inside the club with her and hinojosa; when she did see appellant, his behavior was not unusual in any way. after an argument at about 11:30 p.m., andres and casarez left the club, and appellant went out to look for them. all three returned about five minutes later. security guards let casarez back inside but told andres and appellant they had to pay again in order to re-enter. appellant and andres argued with the guards. ng required to pay twice. the brothers tried to force their way back in, but were physically removed by security. eventually, andres and appellant re-paid the entrance fee and returned to the club to watch the rest of the concert. casarez saw appellant drink during this period, but did not know how much he had to drink. zaldivar and hinojosa left at about 1:50 a.m., when the concert ended. they retrieved the suv, which hinojosa drove toward the club entrance to wait for the rest of the group. while they were waiting, hinojosa and zaldivar were told twice parking lot, to leave. casarez and andres emerged from the club and got to the suv at about 2:20 a.m. appellant came out about 10 minutes later; he was upset, angry and extremely drunk. guillen saw appellant, who seemed drunk, after he left the club. guillen had not seen appellant before. at about 2:35 a.m., guillen saw appellant urinating guard shined a flashlight on appellant and told him it 4 just then, appellant grabbed something from inside the rear door of the suv. oscar heard that appellant had a gun in his hand, which he was aiming and firing at guillen and the valets, less than 35 feet away. appellant emptied the clip. unable to escape, guillen threw himself toward melvin, who was on the ground. guillen heard about nine shots. melvin later died from a single gunshot wound to the chest. the other three valets were unhurt; guillen survived after being shot in the arm, stomach and knee. zaldivar, who earlier had switched places with hinojosa and was now in the seat, tried to open the door and get out because he was afraid his brother had been hurt. appellant climbed into the back seat of the suv and told zaldivar to drive. she refused. afraid that appellant might shoot her, zaldivar threw the keys to her husband and they, cazares and andres ran back into the club. before going back into the building to wait for the police, zaldivar looked back and saw appellant in the suv. deputy responding to the call about the shooting at the nightclub saw appellant running in the parking lot by the building and yelled for him to stop. appellant kept running. the deputy chased after and detained appellant, who stopped running on a nearby street. another deputy responding to the shooting call pulled into the lot behind ieved the semiautomatic handgun appellant used from the and placed it in her patrol car. the 5 magazine was later recovered from a search of the inside of the suv, on the front a sergeant found nine shell casings, three bullets and a jacket from a fourth bullet in the parking lot where the shooting occurred. he found three bullet strike fourth strike mark 15-to-20 feet up on the same wall. one bullet was later bullets and bullet jacket recovered from the shooting scene, and the bullet from from the parking lot -caliber semiautomatic pistol. the criminalist explained that each shot required a separate pull of the sensitive trigger and, because of the force of recoil, a shooter would have to re-aim before each shot. appellant did not present any evidence. discussion 1. no. 8.66.1 a. forfeiture appellant argues the court erred when it instructed the jury using caljic no. 8.66.1, because it misstates murder. we disagree. 8.66.1, should not be given because it was inapplicable to the facts of this case. but he did not object to any specific language in the instruction, nor did he ask that it be modified or clarified in any respect. the attorney general contends that, by failing to challenge caljic no. 8.66.1 on these bases at trial, appellant forfeited 6 his challon appeal that an instruction correct in law and responsive to the evidence was too general or incomplete unless the party has requested appropriate clarifying or amplifying language . . . the trial people v. hudson (2006) 38 cal.4th 1002, 10111012.) because appellant contends not just that caljic no. 8.66.1 is misleading with regard to the kill zone theory of attempted murder, but that it misstates the law, his failure to object does not constitute forfeiture of the issue on appeal. (ibid.) we turn to the merits of his contention. b. standard of review we review a claim of instructional error de novo. (people v. posey (2004) 32 cal.4th 193, 218.) the challenged instruction is reviewed in the context of the instructions as a whole and in light of the entire record. (people v. lucas (2014) 60 cal.4th 153, 282, disapproved on another ground in people v. romero and self (2015) 62 cal.4th 1, 53, fn. 19.) to the extent appellant asserts the jury was confused or mislead by the kill zone instruction it is up to him to demonstrate that jurors understood the instruction in the way he claims. (see people v. cross (2008) 45 cal.4th 58, 6768 [defendant who challenges instruction as being likelihood that jury understood the instruction in the wjurors with intelligence and common sense [citation] and do not assume that these people v. coddington (2000) 23 cal.4th 529, 594, overruled on another ground in price v. superior court (2001) 25 cal.4th 1046, 1069, fn. 13.) 7 c. attempted murder law people v. stone (2009) 46 cal.4th 131, 136 (stone).) in people v. bland (2002) 28 cal.4th 313 (bland), the court concluded that the doctrine of transferred intent does not apply to attempted murder.

[] whether a perpetrator actually intended to kill the victim, either as a primary target or as someone within a the jury also was . . . individual point or a whole and each (1) it was 3 caljic no. 8.66.1, revised in fall 2015, now states: primary target[s], may at the same time attempt to kill [all] [people] [persons] in the zone is created when a perpetrator specifically intending to kill the primary target by lethal means also attempts to kill [anyone] [everyone] in the immediate vicinity of the primary target[s]. if the perpetrator has this specific intent, and employs the means sufficient to kill the primary target[s] and all others in the kill zone, the perpetrator is guilty of the crime[s] of attempted murder of the [other person[s]] [anyone] in the kill zone. the comment following the instructito more accurately track the holding in . . . bland 9 reasonable doubt; (2) each of the five counts chargedincluding attempted murderrequired proof of a specific intent; (3) murder requires implied or express malice; (4) express malice means an intent to kill; (5) attempted murder requires express malice; and (6) willful, deliberate and premeditated murder (whether attempted or completed) requires an intent to kill. e. analysis appellant argues that the version caljic no. 8.66.1 used at trial is erroneous specific intent, and misleadingly mandates a finding of concurrent intent if a juror could reasonably infer that the defendant intended to kill everyone in the area, irrespective of whether a juror actually draws that reasonable inference. 8.66.1 rest primarily on criticisms raised in dicta in mccloud, supra, 211 cal.app.4th 788, a decision by division one of this district.4 in mccloud, two defendants fired 10 shots from a semiautomatic handgun into a packed party inside a building containing over 400 people. three bullets hit three victims; two were killed and one was injured. seven bullets hit no one. (id. at pp. 791, 793794.) the jury was instructed with caljic no. 8.66.1, and the prosecution argued in its closing ]he kill zone says that anyone who is in the line of fire, anyone 4 although the supreme court denied review in mccloud, the scope of the kill zone theory as interpreted by the appellate courts is currently under review. in july 2015, the supreme court granted review in people v. sek, s226721, an opinion by division one on a related issue. the court deferred further action on sek pending its disposition of people v. canizales, review granted november 19, 2014, s221958, a case that criticized mccloud. 10 who could have potentially been hit is a victim of that attempted murder. . . . you take a gun, you sho[o]t at a party, you are not sure who at that party is going to get hit, you can still get the kill zone. you are still endangering every single person in . . . id. at p. 801.) both defendants were convicted of two counts of second degree murder. one defendant, stringer, was also convicted of 46 counts of attempted murder. (id. at p. 791.) the court concluded erroneous conception of the kill zone theory, because the prosecutor had not attempted murder victims on the kill zone theory. that is incorrect as a matter of law. the prosecutor never attempted to argue that stringer . . . specifically intended to kill every single person in each of the putative kill zones, as the kill mccloud, supra, 211 cal.app.4th at p. 802.) thus, the court found the record lacked sufficient evidence to support application of the kill zone theory, and reversed the attempted murder counts. (id. at pp. 802, 804.) having stated its holding, the court noted in dicta of caljic no. 8.66.1 . . . misleading and have no basis in the lawbland. . . . merely by subjecting individuals other than the primary target to a risk of fatal 11 mccloud, supra, 211 cal.app.4th at p. 802, fn. 7.) in our view, mccloud misunderstands the kill zone theory and instruction. bland held that intent to kill a person may be inferred either from the nature and scope of an attack or the method employed. (bland, supra, 28 cal.4th at pp. 330, 331, fn. 6.) but, under mccloud, such an inference would appear to be impermissible. the view that mccloud goes too far finds support in stone, supra, 46 cal.4th 131. in stone, referring to kill zone theory, the court found driver [of the car into which he shot] but did not specifically target the two who survived. [citation.] . . . . we summarized the rule that applies when an intended target is killed and unintended targets are injured but not killed. . . . [] . . . . [i]f a person targets one particular person, . . . a jury could find the person also, concurrently, intended to killand thus was guilty of the attempted murder ofother, nontargeted (id. at p. 136 (some italics added); see also people v. smith (2005) 37 cal.4th 733, 755756 (dis. opn. of werdegar, j.) . . analysis . . . focuses on (1) whether [jury] can rationally infer from the type and extent of force employed that the defendant intentionally created a zone of fatal harm, and (2) whether the nontargeted . . . added)].) viewed in isolation. it must be construed in light of the entire instruction of which it is a part. (people v. ledesma (2006) 39 cal.4th 641, 718.) viewed as a whole, the instruction adequately imparted the requirement that the jury find that appellant harbored a specific intent to kill. a reasonable jury would not have construed 12 caljic no. 8.66.1 to mean that it could find he committed attempted murder merely because he placed guillen and the valets at risk of harm. in addition, the court properly instructed on the elements of attempted murder with caljic no. 8.66, with which appellant does not take issue and which includes the specific intent requirement, and directed the jury to consider the instructions as a whole and in light of the others. we presume that jurors instructions. (people v. hovarter (2008) 44 cal.4th 983, 1005.) a reasonable jury, considering the instructions as a whole and in conjunction with caljic no. 8.66.1, would not conclude it could find appellant guilty of attempted murder based solely on the conclusion that he exposed the members of the group to a risk of harm. (cf. people v. bragg (2008) 161 cal.app.4th 1385, 1395people v. campos (2007) 156 cal.app.4th 1228, 1243 [finding no possibility that jury misapplied calcrim no. 600 and failed to find defendant had specific intent to kill victim, partly due to fact that jury was instructed on elements of attempted murder, including requirement of specific intent].) .1 misstates the law as to the kill zone theory or misled the jury and permitted it to find him guilty of attempted murder without finding that he had the specific intent to murder the victims who survived the shooting. 13 f. harmless error even if we assume the instruction was erroneous, any error would be harmless because it was not reasonably probable that, had a correct instruction been given, a more favorable verdict would have resulted.5 by finding appellant committed five willful, deliberate and premeditated (attempted and completed) murders, the jury necessarily found that each crime was committed by appellant (he is not) that the prior version of caljic no. 8.66.1 used at trial here misstated the law by failing to mention the requirement for specific intent, any error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because the jury independently found specific intent as to each count. (see chapman, supra, 386 u.s. at p. 24; watson, supra, 46 cal.2d at p. 836.) 2. the claim of prosecutorial misconduct was forfeited a. relevant proceedings in closing, the prosecutor argued: and willful, deliberate, premeditated means that you thought about the process. intent to kill comepremeditated means you thought about killing, and then you kill. 5 the parties agree the federal constitutional standard governs the harmless error analysis. (see chapman v. california (1967) 386 u.s. 18, 24 (chapman).) we find the purported instructional error harmless under any standard. (see, e.g., neder v. united states (1999) 527 u.s. 1, 1516 [use of an instruction that omits element of an offense does not require reversal if error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt under chapman, supra, 386 u.s. at p. 24; people v. flood (1998) 18 cal.4th 470, 487, 490 [misdirection of the jury, including the giving of an incorrect or ambiguous instruction that does not amount to federal constitutional error, is reviewed under the harmless error standard articulated in people v. watson (1956) 46 cal.2d 818, 836 (watson)].) 14 -degree murder is when you lie and wait for . . . somebody. you kill them. a lot of time goes by, you have time to prepare; right? however killing, coldhearted, coldblooded killing instant [sic] can also be willful, deliberate, premeditated. the law does not say he first-degree murder. no. that matters, not the duration of time. the distance between the pitcher mound and home plate is 60 feet, 6 inches. coming 100 miles per hour. that decision he has to make, split decision coming hundred miles per hour, that decision he makes to swing involves willful, deliberate, premeditation. riving a car, you come to an from your left, cars coming from your right. you got to decide. i see that truck coming about 50 feet. am i gonna make it? that decision, you deciding to move, you went through the intersection. that involves willful, (italics added.) appellant asserts that, by using flawed, misleading analogies, the law regarding and improperly equated premeditation and deliberation with malice aforethought. b. forfeiture ction to, nor sought any judicial admonition regarding, 15 argument. on appeal, appellant does not argue that such an objection would have been futile. preserved for review. (people v. benson (1990) 52 cal.3d 754, 794; people v. clair (1992) 2 cal.4th 629, 662 (clair).) 3. no demonstration that trial counsel was ineffective appellant attempts to avoid forfeiture by arguing that his trial counsel was ineffective in decision to raise or forgo an objection at trial is typically a tactical decision and we -people v. frierson (1979) 25 cal.3d 142, 158.) prior to closing arguments, the jury was told to base its decisions solely on the evidence and the jury instructions. the court specifically informed the jury ents or at no. 1.00.) the jury is people v. hovarter, supra, 44 cal.4th at p. 1005.) in addition, before he began his argument, con . . . during summation, a prosecutor may refer to matters which, while not in evidence, are common knowledge or illustrations drawn from common experience, history, or literature to help illustrate legal principles. (people v. friend (2009) 47 prosecutor before the jury, the question is whether there is a reasonable likelihood 16 that the jury construed or applied any of the complained-of remarks in an people v. samayoa (1997) 15 cal.4th 795, 841.) we evaluate those comments in the context of the entire argument and the jury instructions. (people v. stitely (2005) 35 cal.4th 514, 558-559 (stitely).) in doing so, we presume jurors followed the clair, supra, 2 cal.4th at p. 663, fn. 8.) appellant points to nothing in the record that overcomes the presumption direction and based its decisions on the evidence, and understoinstructions prevailed over any conflicting statement of law made by counsel. (clair, supra, 2 cal.4th at p. 663, fn. 8.) appellant has made no showing that the jury was or may have been misled in the manner he suggests, because there is no stitely, supra, 35 cal.4th at p. 559.) lure to object: an objection would have been unnecessary, instructions as to the law, and its additional instructions that only its legal determined that an objection would be unwise . . . because an objection (and possibly an admonition as well) likely would have served to highlight matter that (people v. stewart (2004) 33 cal.4th 425, 509.) finally, as discussed above, any failure to object was not prejudicial given 17 reasonable doubt, that appellant committed willful, deliberate and premeditated acts of murder and attempted murder. in sum, we are confident that any reasonable jury would have reached the same result even in the absence of the disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports willhite, j. we concur: epstein, p. j. collins, j.
