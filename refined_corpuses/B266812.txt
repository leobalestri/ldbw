(people v. hobley (july 1, 2003, b160419).) in august 2015, defendant filed proposition 36 petitions to recall his third-strike sentences pursuant to section 1170.126.2 defendant alleged that the convictions for which he was serving the sentences, assault with a deadly weapon and criminal threats, 1 all further statutory references are to the penal code, unless otherwise indicated. 2 t filed within two years of the effective date of proposition 36, and made no showing of good cause for the delay, as required by section 1170.126, subdivision (b). the trial court did not base its ruling on that provision. 3 were not serious or violent felonies listed in section 1192.7, subdivision (c). the trial court denied the petition on the ground that defendant was serving a life sentence imposed due to the commission of a serious or violent felony, and defendant filed a timely notice of appeal from the order. : [] . . . [t]he inmate is serving an indeterminate term of life imprisonment imposed pursuant to [the three strikes law] for a conviction of a felony or felonies that are not defined as serious and/or violen under section 667.5, subdivision (c), or section 1192.7, subdivision (c). ( 1170.126, subd. (e)(1); people v. johnson (2015) 61 cal.4th 674, 682.) contrary to the allegation in , third-strike sentences were imposed for offenses that were serious felonies: assault with a deadly weapon, and felony criminal threat with the finding that defendant personally used a knife. (see  1192.7 subd. (c)(31) & (23).) thus ineligible for resentencing. in his supplemental brief filed in support of this appeal, defendant contends that his sentence amounted to double jeopardy and violated the constitutional prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment, and that the evidence adduced at trial was insufficient to prove that he was armed with a knife. a trial court may not go beyond the record of conviction in determining qualifies for resentencing. (people v. bradford (2014) 227 cal.app.4th 1322, 1337-1341.) thus, as the disqualifying factors were pled and found true by a jury, the court was not permitted to consider evidence rejected by the jury. further, nothing in proposition 36 provides for a new trial the rule remains that defendant is not entitled to challenge his criminal conviction in a second appeal after limited resentencing proceedings or other posttrial procedures. (people v. senior (1995) 33 cal.app.4th 531, 535-537.) counsel has fully complied with her responsibilities and that no arguable issue exists. we conclude that defendant has, by virtue of counsewende procedure 4 and our review of the record, received adequate and effective appellate review of the judgment entered against him in this case. (smith v. robbins (2000) 528 u.s. 259, 278; people v. kelly (2006) 40 cal.4th 106, 123-124.) the order is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports.
