(f)([1])), assault by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury ( 245, subd. (a)(4)), 1 statutory references are to the penal code. 3 false imprisonment by violence ( 236, 237), and making a criminal threat ( 422, subd. (a)). b. the june 1, 2016 incident while the charges arising out of the october 15, 2015 incident were pending, mitchell went to on june 1, 2016 and asked her to drive him to a probation hearing. penn refused. mitchell became upset, slapped penn in the face, e car. mitchell pulled the car out of the driveway and drove ding and running stop signs. me. mitchell raced down a small residential street and drove into several parked cars, including a recreational vehicle (rv) owned by arturo cortez and a car owned by another individual. penn heard a loud boom and felt her car come to a stop. penn could not move and lost consciousness. s neighbor, who was inside his house at outside, and saw several cars in his front yard. the neighbor saw mitchell take penn out of the car and put her down in the middle of the street. the people charged mitchell with kidnapping ( 207, subd. (a)), inflicting corporal injury on someone with whom he had a dating relationship within seven years of a conviction for domestic violence ( 273.5, subd. (f)(1)), assault with a deadly weapon ( 245, subd. (a)(1)), contempt ( 166, subd. (c)(1)), and attempted murder ( 187, subd. (a)(1), 664). the people also alleged that mitchell committed these offenses while released from custody on bail in a pending case (arising out of the october 15, 2015 incident) within the meaning of section 12022.2 4 and that mitchell attempted to kill penn willfully, deliberately, and with premeditation. the trial court consolidated the two pending cases against mitchell. c. the plea agreement the parties negotiated an agreement to resolve the two cases: mitchell pleaded no contest to attempted murder, inflicting corporal injury on someone with whom he had a dating relationship within seven years of a conviction for domestic violence, and making a criminal threat, admitted the on-bail allegation, and received a total prison sentence of 13 years. the people dismissed the remaining six counts and struck the allegation that the attempted murder was willful, deliberate, and premeditated. at the april the following exchange occurred: this case, there will be actual restitution. the people will be dismissing several charges against you with the understanding that you will be financially responsible for all the losses incurred in this case, not just the charges to which you have pled. do you understand that? harvey waiver? 2 2 people v. harvey (1979) 25 cal.3d 754. harvey waiver is (people v. brooks (2017) 15 cal.app.5th 331, 334, fn. 3.) 5 d. the restitution hearing the people sought restitution for the damage to rv. mitchell argued he did not have to pay restitution to anyone were not the direct objects of his criminal acts as defined in the charged the people argued the trial court could order mitchell to pay the information named the victim seeking restitution. at the hearing, cortez testified he did not see mitchell drive into the parked cars, but he rushed home when his wife called him about the collision. when he arrived, he saw a car, , which had been into the , which was very cortez testified he received $17,598 from his insurance company for the damage to the rv.3 the trial court ruled cortez was a victim and entitled to conduct in trying to kill penn by crashing her car . the trial court stated the evidence (including statements to witnesses) erratic drivingrunning of the stop were the victim. these were not unintentional acts, and they are the sum and substance of the basis for [the attempted murder charge,] amongst other things, so i do find restitution is 3 the court must order full restitution regardless of the insurance coverage. (see people v. birkett (1999) 21 cal.4th 226, 246; people v. garcia (2010) 185 cal.app.4th 1203, 1216.) 6 the court ordered mitchell to pay cortez $17,598.10 in restitution. mitchell timely appealed. discussion mitchell argues the trial court erred in ordering him to pay restitution to cortez because the amended information did not name cortez as a victim, cortez ed, and cortez does listed in section 1202.4, subdivision (k). the people argue that he did not obtain a certificate of probable cause and that, on the merits, the trial a. mitchell did not need a certificate of probable cause to appeal the restitution order section 1237.5 provides, in pertinent part: be taken by the defendant from a judgment of conviction upon a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, . . . except where both of the following are met: [] (a) the defendant has filed with the trial court a written statement, executed under oath or penalty of perjury showing reasonable constitutional, jurisdictional, or other grounds going to the legality of the proceedings. [] (b) the trial court has executed and filed a certificate of probable cause for such appeal with the clerk nevertheless, of issues may be raised in a guilty or nolo contendere plea appeal without issuance of a certificate: (1) search and seizure issues for which an appeal is provided under section 1538.5, subdivision (m); and (2) issues regarding proceedings held subsequent to the plea for the purpose of determining the degree of the crime and 7 (people v. panizzon (1996) 13 cal.4th 68, 74; accord, people v. hurlic (2018) 25 cal.app.5th 50, 55; see cal. rules of court, rule 8.304(b)(4).) the second exception. the trial court ordered restitution after accepting and convicting mitchell on his plea, the validity of which mitchell does not challenge. mitchell argues stitution ordered to be paid to . . . and d at the change-of-plea hearing . . . that [he] would also be responsible for losses incurred by third parties . . . . rather than seeking to invalidate a term of his plea, mitchell seeks to enforce a term of his plea, namely, restitution for , as he understood that phrase. occurred at the hearing may be incorrect, but he is not challenging the validity of his plea. (see people v. brown (2007) 147 cal.app.4th 1213, 1220 [defendant did not need a certificate of probable cause to appeal an order requiring restitution to the victim compensation board because the appeal challenged the -of-pocket expenses].) mitchell did not need a certificate of probable cause to appeal the order requiring him to pay restitution to cortez.4 4 although not raised by the people, mitchell arguably failed to comply with california rules of court, rule 8.304(b)(4)(b), by not stating on his notice of appeal that he was invoking an exception to the certificate requirement (which mitchell could have done by checking the box on the form notice of appeal that occurring after the plea that do not affect the validity of the 8 moreover, mitchell does not challenge the requirement in his plea that he must pay restitution, only discretion in calculating whether that phrase includes da (see people v. holmberg (2011) 195 cal.app.4th 1310, 1320 hen the claim on appeal is merely that the trial court abused the discretion the parties intended it to exercise, there is, in substance, no people v. buttram (2003) 30 cal.4th 773, 786; see id. appeal of his sentence to the agreed-upon maximum term did not attack the validity of the plea because the negotiated maximum ; people v. hurlic, supra, 25 cal.app.5th at p. 56 [same].) ion order made on 06/0 we liberally construe the notice of appeal, however, in favor of its sufficiency.

(id. at p. 1273.) the charging document named only four of the nine people the defendant hit, but the trial court ordered the defendant to pay restitution to individuals not named in the charging document. the court in walker affirmed the awardpersons in the vehicles involved in that instance [of driving under the influence] are losses arising out of which the defen [citation.] whether these potential victims were specifically named in the charging document is irrelevant. section 1202.4 imposes no such duty to entitlement to restitution turn on the happenstance of whether 12 the prosecutor located or named that victim before the defendant (id. at pp. 1275-1276.) similarly, did not depend owhich victims to name in the information or the decision whether to bring additional on which the attempted murder charge was based. second, to evaluate cortez was not a direct criminal conduct of the attempted murder offense, not whether cortez was an intended victim. (see walker, supra, 231 cal.app.4th at pp. 1274-1275 [arising out of the criminal conduct for which the defendant has been convicted, which turns on what conduct is encompassed .) mitchell pleaded guilty to attempted murder, one element of which is a direct but ineffectual act toward people v. snchez (2016) 63 cal.4th 411, 457; see  187, subd. (a), 664.) but ineffectual act toward killing penn was intentionally crashing into other cars with penn as his passenger. this conduct directly caused economic loss to several victims, including cortez. both parties cite the caopinion in people v. martinez, supra, 2 cal.5th 1093. martinez supports the people, not mitchell. the supreme court in martinez held that id. at p. 1105) the supreme steals a car and a third party reckless driver damages it, we do not doubt that the owner would be entitled to reimbursement from the thief under section 1202.4, subdivision (f). but that is 13 criminal conduct (namely the unlawful deprivation of his or her property) . . . .ibid.) just like the owner of the stolen car in the supreme , of driving into parked cars in a direct but ineffectual effort to kill penn. the supreme court also stated in martinez that a court means (martinez, supra, 2 cal.5th at pp. 1105-1106.) the supreme court again explained by illustrationburglar breaks a window to enter a home, he or she may be ordered to pay for the broken window in victim restitution, even though the burglary statute requires the prosecution to prove only that the defendant entered the house with the intent to commit a felony. [citation.] if the burglar happens to have committed the prohibited entry by some means that causes damage to the home, a trial court certainly canand musttake id. at p. 1106.) because mitchell attempted to murder penn by means of driving car the trial court properly ordered restitution for all the damage mitchell caused in trying to kill penn. (see people v. pierce (2015) 234 cal.app.4th 1334, 1336-1337 [owner of a stolen car, two utility companies, and a property owner defendant pleaded no contest to robbery after his accomplice drove a stolen car into a telephone pole while attempting to evade the police, causing damage to the pole and a nearby house]; see also people v. foalima (2015) 239 cal.app.4th 1376, 1396-1397 14 clothes and household items destroyed by a fire set to destroy evidence of the the damages].) third, section 1202.4, subdivision (k), does not preclude an section 1202.4, subdivision (k), lists five categories of persons or entities , victima familial relationship with the actual victim and corporate or government entities that were direct victims of a crime. (see  1202.4, subd. (k)(1)-(5).) mitchell argues that, because there was no evidence of any familial relationship between cortez and penn, and cortez was not a corporation or government agency, cortez is not 2.4. mitchell misses the point of subdivision (k). section 1202.4, subdivision (k), describes ,it does not exclude an actual victim, which, as discussed, cortez was. (see people v. lewis interpretation [of a statute] that would lead to absurd results ) because cortez was an actual victim, he is entitled to restitution. (see section 1202.4, subd. people v. ortiz (1997) 53 cal.app.4th 791, 796-concern for persons who have suffered loss as the result of criminal conduct, our supreme court has given .) mitchell argues for the first time in his reply brief that he did not plead no contest to attempted murder arising out of the june 1, 2016 incident2015 that co 15 mitchell points out that, when he pleaded no contest to attempted murder, the court made a reference to the october 15, 2015 date and that the information and abstract of judgment stated the attempted murder occurred on october 15, 2015. mitchell argues the events on october 15, 2015 had nothing to do with [car] later, on june 1, 2016. we do not consider such arguments raised for the first time on reply. (see people v. zamudio (2008) 43 cal.4th 327, 353; people v. jacobs (2013) 220 cal.app.4th 67, 83.) in any event, the people did not charge mitchell with attempted murder in connection with the october 15, 2015 incident. and mitchell admitted that he was out on bail when he attempted to kill penn, which the people could only have alleged in connection with the june 1, 2016 incident, and that, at the time he attempted to kill penn, he had been released from custody in case number ma067286, which was the 2015 case. c. the abstract of judgment must be corrected the people point out that the abstract of judgment should be corrected to reflect that mitchell pleaded no contest to violating section 273.5, subdivision (f)(1), not section 273.5, subdivision (f)(2). we agree and direct the trial court to make that correction. (see people v. mitchell (2001) 26 cal.4th 181, 185 any time, and appellate courts . . . that have properly assumed jurisdiction of cases have ordered correction of abstracts of judgment that did not people v. amaya (2015) 238 cal.app.4th 379, 385 [same].) the abstract of judgment must also be corrected to reflect that the attempted murder to which mitchell pleaded no contest occurred in 2016, not 2015. 16 disposition the judgment is affirmed. the matter is remanded with directions for the trial court to correct the abstract of judgment to state that mitchell pleaded no contest to violating section 273.5, subdivision (f)(1), not section 273.5, subdivision (f)(2), and to state mitchell committed attempted murder in 2016, not 2015. the trial court is also directed to send a corrected abstract of judgment to the department of corrections and rehabilitation. segal, j. we concur: perluss, p. j. zelon, j.
