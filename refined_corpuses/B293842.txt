(a)). 3 the trial court held a hearing petition in may 2018 and took the matter under submission. it later denied the petition, finding prior conviction for assault with intent to commit murder (former section 217) is a disqualifying conviction that renders him ineligible for relief. though former section 217 was not specifically enumerated in proposition 36, the court found the crime was effectively attempted murder, a disqualifying offense. defendant appealed the denial of his proposition 36 petition, and this court appointed counsel to represent him. after attorney filed an opening brief that raised no issues but stated she remained available to provide additional briefing if invited by this court. on april 25, 2019, we sent defendant a letter advising he could personally submit a supplemental brief within 30 days. we received no response. then, taking her up on her invitation to provide briefing if ult with intent to commit murder qualifies as [a]ny homicide offense, including pertinent statutory provisions. and having examined the record ourselves, we are satisfied responsibilities of counsel and no arguable issue exists.
