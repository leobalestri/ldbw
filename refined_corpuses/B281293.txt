(a)); (4) a 1991 conviction for robbery ( 211); (5) a 1991 conviction for attempted robbery ( 211 & 664); (6) a 1994 conviction for being a felon with a firearm (former  12021, subd.

[s]form of state supervision. as an adult, [he] has never successfully completed probation or parole, and he was on parole when he committed the current o record while in prison for the 1997 conviction. this history included (1) five incidents of mutual combat (one in 2000, two in 2004, one in 2006, and one in 2007), one of which (in 2004) necessitated the use of force; (2) two instances of battery on an inmate (one in july 1998, and another in september 2012), one of which (in 2012) resulted in serious bodily injury to the inmate; (3) one incident of attempted battery on a peace officer (in june 2001); (4) two instances of threatening a staff member (one in 5 march 2001, and another that was downgraded to use of obscene language in 2015), both of which involved profanity; (5) three instances of attempting to introduce or possession of contraband (in july 2001, february 2008, and february 2009); and (6) five instances of disobeying orders or disrespecting prison staff (in may 1999, september 1999, april 2003, february 2004, and september 2005). security classification (with a higher number corresponding to a greater risk of violence) had gone from 66 in 1994, to a high of 124 in 2012, and remained at 100 in 2015. bserved that defendant to commit violent acts while incarcerated in state prisincluding, most recently, battery on an inmate causing serious bodily injury in 2012, and use of vulgar or obscene language in 2015. inal history is viewed alongside currently poses an unreasonable ris the court then turned to the factors cutting in favor of resentencingnamely, the programs defendant had completed, his age, and his post-release plans. the court stated that [ed] after th motivation to address the issues that led to his criminal behavior is the opportunity for releourt has little confidence [defendant] would voluntarily or successfully complete his re-entry programs once he is released into the 6 47at this suggestion was while in prison. -y family support[] [that] can be critical to a successful transitiondisciplinary record, and m iv. appeal defendant filed this timely appeal. discussion until court to impose a minimum sentence of 25 years to life in prison for a defendant convicted of a felonyno matter what the felonyso- 667, subd. (e)(2)(a) & 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(a).) the reform act changed this law. as pertinent here, the reform act entitled defendants previously sentenced on a nonserious and nonviolent felony to a 25-years-to-life sentence under the three strikes law to petition for resentencing for that offense. ( 1170.126, subd. (b).) whether a defendant is entitled to that resentencing (and thus to an earlier release) turns on (1) whether he is eligible for relief and, if so, (2) whether he is suitable for reliefthat is, whether would pose an unreasonable risk of the reform act explicitly sets forth the factors a trial court whether resentencing the [defendant] would pose an unreasonable risk of 7 history, including the type of crimes committed, the extent of injury to victims, the length of prior prison commitments, and the other evidence the court, within its discretion, determines to be relevant in deciding whether a new sentence would result in an unreasonable risk of d(f) & (g).) the people bear the burden of establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the defendant poses such a risk. (people v. superior court (kaulick) (2013) 215 cal.app.4th 1279, 1305 (kaulick); people v. buford (2016) 4 cal.app.5th 886, 895-898, review granted jan. 11, 2017, s238790 (buford).)3 we factual findings) or for an abuse of discretion (because it entails subd.

(people v. macabeo (2016) 1 cal.5th 1206, 1212 [factual findings reviewed for substantial evidence]; john b. 3 because defendant does not challenge the weight of the people v. arevalo (2016) 244 cal.app.4th 836, 842, which holds that the people must establish a lack of suitability beyond a reasonable doubt. every subsequent decision has disagreed with arevalo. (people v. frierson (2016) 1 cal.app.5th 788, 793-794, review granted oct. 19, 2016, s236728; people v. newman (2016) 2 cal.app.5th 718, 730-732, review granted nov. 22, 2016, s237491; buford, supra, 4 cal.app.5th at pp. 895-898, review granted.) this issue is now before our supreme court in frierson and newman. 8 v. superior court (2006) 38 cal.4th 1177, 1186 [exercises of discretion reviewed for an abuse of discretion].) the trial court did not err in denying defendant relief under the reform act. because the parties conceded that defendant was eligible for relief, the sole question was whether he would. to begin, the court painstakingly examined the categories of evidence specified by the reform act, reviewing criminal history, his disciplinary record while incarcerated, his efforts at rehabilitation, his post-release efforts at rehabilitation, his age, and his post-release plans counseled slightly in favor of release, but concluded that these factors were outweighed by the evidence indicating that defendant still posed a risk to public safetynamely, his predilection for criminal activity, as demonstrated by his pre-incarceration criminal history and his continuation of that pattern of behavior while incarcerated, up to and including the years immediately before and while his petition for relief under the reform act was pending. defendant raises two categories of objections to the trial first, he takes issue with the standard the court used as a yardstick for measuring whether defendant would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. to begin, he asserts that public safety is solely concerned with whether a defendant is likely to commit violent crimes. however, the law is to the contrary. (see, e.g., people v. nasalga (1996) 12 cal.4th 784, 790 it is in the best interest for public safety to 9 enhance the penalties for the crimes of vehicle theft and receiving stolen vehicles].) further, defendant contends that the trial court erred in citing kaulick, which analogized the suitability inquiry under the reform act to the suitability inquiry undertaking for parole hearings. but kaulick drew the analogy in the context of deciding which standard of review to apply on appeal. (kaulick, supra, 215 cal.app.4th at p. 1306, fn. 29.) we are not applying kaulick, so kaulick itself is irrelevant on this point. what is more, the trial court in this case ability under the reform act. but the court looked to parole law only three timesas authority for the propositions that (1) and danger to public ; (2) advancing age decreases ; and (3) the existence of post-release plans tends to show suitability for parole. given that the last two factors cut in relies on common sense alone, the trial courtin this case, even if we assumed for the sake of argument that it was error to draw those analogies. second, defendant argues that the trial court did not properly apply the standard for suitability to the evidence defendant presented. specifically, he argues that the trial court (1) gave too much weight to his criminal history, which did not involve his personal use of a gun or injury to any of his victims and which was, in any event, old because he committed his last crime in 1995; (2) gave insufficient weight to the fact that he 10 committed the 2012 battery causing serious bodily injury on his cellmate because the cellmate was a sexual predator; (3) gave insufficient weight to his acceptance into the transitional living facility; (4) gave insufficient weight to the letters from prison officials; (5) gave too much weight to the timing of his rehabilitative efforts; and (6) wrongly found that defendant had no family support. ents concede that the trial court considered the evidence at issue; defendant simply asks us to reweigh it and reach a different conclusion. this is something we are not allowed to do. (people v. covarrubias (2016) 1 cal.5th 838, 890.) we would not be inclined to do so, even if we could. that his criminal history did not involve his personal use of a gun or injury to any of his victimsis technically accurate, but ignores that his 1991 robbery conviction rested on defendant pushing the robbery victim to the floor and handcuffing him while one of his compatriots wielded a gun and another repeatedly shouted, that his 1991 attempted robbery conviction involved defendant telling a woman to hand over money or else he would shoot her son; and ignores that his 1994 felon-in-possession conviction rested on defendant having cond assertionthat he savagely assaulted his cellmate because his cellmate was a sexual predator about to attack himi got off the bunk and saw him with his dick in his hand jerking of fifth assertionthat his post-reform act rehabilitative efforts should not have been discountedasks us to discredit logic that 11 re-entry efforts once back in the community is a relevant consideration, and a defendant whose sole motivation for rehabilitation is to obtain release may lack that motivation once the release occurs. the record. defendant submitted letters from his stepfather, his uncle, release. defense counsel also commented during the evidentiary hearing that membs family were in the audience, but this is not evidence. (see people v. garcia (1984) 160 cal.app.3d 82, 88-89 [what courtroom audience does is not evidence].) but the trial court made clear that the negative recordwould eclipse the marginal post-release plans defendant had made. we have no doubt that that court would have reached the same result, even if it had acknowledged the letters from three of accordingly harmless and people v. johnson (2016) 1 cal.app.5th 953, 968 [applying harmless error review under people v. watson (1956) 46 cal.2d 818 to errors under the reform act].) 12 disposition the order is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. ______________________, j. hoffstadt we concur: _________________________, acting p. j. ashmann-gerst _________________________, j.* goodman * retired judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
