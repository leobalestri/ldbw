interviewed mr. funchess in march 2005. as noted, mr. bingley was granted leniency because he testified for the prosecution. mr. funchess told the detectives about a meeting with mr. bingley. mr. bingley said he had robbed the video game store. according to mr. funchess, mr. bingley committed the video store robbery with two accomplices. mr. bingley also referred to a robbery in which mr. frazier was a co-perpetrator. detective lait said it was unclear from mr. bingley had identified mr. frazier as a participant in the video game store robbery. mr. funchess testified that on the day following the video game store robbery, mr. bingley bragged about committing the robbery homicide. mr. bingley said he had two accomplices, fellow gang members. mr. funchess did not know one of the gang funchess had never heard anyone call mr. frazier by one of the aliases referred to by mr. bingley. one of the persons named by mr. bingley was eric alexander. mr. alexander was a tall, kind of

game for mr. video game became so scratched it could not be played anymore. iii. discussion2 a. pretrial motions 1. count 5 dismissal motion defendants argue it was error to deny their motion to dismiss count 5, grand theft person, on grounds a gas station surveillance tape of the incident involving ms. caldwell had been destroyed while in police custody. in august 2004, officer tanya eppenger investigated the grand theft from ms. caldwell at the arco gas station. officer eppenger testified she viewed a surveillance tape. it contained only squares and lines. she was unable to make out any people or vehicles. officer eppenger testified she could not: even tell whether there were any people on the videotape; make out whether any vehicles were present; or see any date or time. if there had been anything at all worth noting, she would have done so. detective eppenger testified it was just a bad tape. the tape was enough to identiinaba made an offer of proof that: the surveillance tape was booked into evidence; but 2 each defendant joins in arguments raised by the other. 8 the case was not filed; and the evidence was destroyed in the normal course of business. the tr law enforcement agencies have a duty, under the due process clause of the fourteenth expected to play a significant role in the california v. trombetta (1984) 467 u.s. 479, 488; accord, people v. beeler (1995) 9 cal.4th 953, 976.) to fall within the scope of this duty, the evidence alue that was apparent before the evidence was destroyed, and be of such a nature that the defendant would be unable to obtain california v. trombetta, supra, 467 u.s. at p. 489; people v. beeler, supra, state to preserve evidentiary material of which no more can be said than that it could have been subjected to tests, the r(arizona v. youngblood defendant can show bad faith on the part of the police, failure to preserve potentially useful evidence does not constiid. at p. 58; accord, people v. beeler, supra, 9 cal.4th at p. 976.) [] on review, we must determine whether, substantial evidence to support its ruling. (people v. griffin (1988) 46 cal.3d 1011, people v. roybal (1998) 19 cal.4th 481, 509-510; accord, people v. depriest (2007) 42 cal.4th 1, 41-42.) the defendant has the burden of establishing the threshold requirement that the evidence had exculpatory value. (people v. alexander (2010) 49 cal.4th 846, 878; people v. depriest, supra, 42 cal.4th at pp. 41-42.) was that the surveillance tape had no exculpatory value whatsoever. the trial court found tape had any exculpatory value that was apparent before it was destroyed. neither defendant has shown the surveillance tape could have played a significant role in his 9 defense. (see people v. hines (1997) 15 cal.4th 997, 1042 [erased portion of videotape].) even if defendants could show the surveillance tape was potentially useful evidence that could have been subjected to testing that might have helped the defense, there was no evidence of bad faith by the police. (arizona v. youngblood, supra, 488 u.s. at p. 57; people v. depriest, supra, 42 cal.4th at p. 42; people v. farnam (2002) 28 cal.4th 107, 166-167.) defendants have not shown any detective believed the surveillance tape had exculpatory value or it was destroyed to deny them an opportunity to defend against the charges. we need not separately discuss the federal constitutional gloss defendants assert discussion is required, or provided, when rejection of a claim on the merits necessarily he first time [on people v. loker people v. lynch (2010) 50 cal.4th 693, 735, fn. 14, disapproved on a different point in people v. mckinnon (2011) 52 cal.4th 610, 636-643.) further, ms. caldwell, the victim, gave an eyewitness account of the crime, positively identified defendants and recorded mr. plate number. 2. severance and consolidation: counts 1 through 5 mr. frazier unsuccessfully moved pretrial to sever counts 1 and 2, the video game store robbery and murder, from counts 3 and 4, the robberies of mr. coleman and mr. severe. mr. frazier also opposed consolidation of count 5, the grand theft of ms. caldwell. he argues the trial court erred in so ruling. mr. alvarez did not join in mr. alvarez forfeited any argument he was prejudiced by the denial of mr. people v. wilson (2008) 44 cal.4th 758, 793; people v. sanders (1995) 11 cal.4th 475, 507; see people v. lewis (2008) 43 cal.4th 415, 481.) 10 joinder or consolidation of charges is preferred because it promotes efficiency. (people v. hartsch (2010) 49 cal.4th 472, 493; alcala v. superior court (2008) 43 ruling under section 954 for an abuse of discretion. (people v. gonzales and soliz (2011) 52 cal.4th 254, 281; people v. lynch, supra, ] correct at the time it was made, a reviewing court must still determine whether, in the end, the joinder of counts resulted in gross unfairness depriving the defendant of due process of law. (people v. rogers (2006) 39 people v. gonzales and soliz, supra, 52 cal.4th at p. 281.) the party seeking severance has the burden to clearly establish a substantial danger of prejudice requiring the charges to be separately tried. (people v. gonzales and soliz, supra, 52 cal.4th at pp. 281-282; people v. catlin (2001) 26 cal.4th 81, 110.) in gonzales, where[:] (1) evidence of the crimes to be jointly tried would not be cross-admissible in separate trials; (2) certain of the charges are unusually likely to inflame the jury against well alter the outcome of some or all of the charges; and (4) any one of the charges carries the death penalty or joinder of them turns the matter into a capital case. [(people v. catlin, supra, 26 cal.4th at p. 110.)] if evidence on each of the joined crimes would have been admissible in a separate trial of the other crimes, then such cross-admissibility ordinarily dispels any inference of prejudice. (ibid.people v. gonzales and soliz, supra, 52 cal.4th at p. 282; accord, people v. gutierrez (2002) 28 cal.4th 1083, 1120.) no abuse of discretion occurred. the offenses were of the same classwrongful with one resulting in murder; therefore joinder was permissible. (people v. gonzales and soliz, supra,52 cal.4th at p. 281; people v. koontz (2002) 27 cal.4th 1041, 1074-1075; see people v. grant (2003) 113 cal.app.4th 579, 586.) the crimes all occurred in gang territory. they were committed close in time, in the fall of 2004. (see people v. lynch, supra, 50 cal.4th at pp. 735-736; people v. 11 zambrano (2007) 41 cal.4th 1082, 1128-1129, disapproved on another point in people v. doolin (2009) 45 cal.4th 390, 421, fn. 22; people v. gray (2005) 37 cal.4th 168, 221.) evidence of the several crimes was arguably cross-admissible in that they occurred in the same neighborhood, close in time, and the perpetrators took cash and cellular telephones. (see people v. perez (1967) 65 cal.2d 615, 618-619; people v. renchie (1963) 217 cal.app.2d 560, 562-563.) there were no charges that were unusually likely to inflame the jury. weak and strong cases were not joined. the evidence against mr. frazier was strong as to each count. the victims all repeatedly and positively identified him as the perpetrator. none of the charges was a capital offense and joinder did not convert the matter into a capital case. (people v. mckinnon, supra, 52 cal.4th at p. 630; people v. hartsch, supra, 49 cal.4th at p. 493.) here too, we need not separately discuss the federal constitutional gloss defendant asserts for the first time on appeal. (people v. lynch, supra, 50 cal.4th at p. 735, fn. 14; people v. loker, supra, 44 cal.4th at p. 704, fn. 7.) b. sufficiency of the evidence 1. committed for the benefit of a criminal street gang defendants argue there was no substantial evidence the offenses, particularly the robbery homicide and grand theft person incidents were committed for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with a street gang. they further contend it was error to allow detective john flores to testify in response to hypothetical questions that mirrored the evidence at trial. here, as in people v. jones (2009) 47 cal.4th 566, 571, footnote 2, at the direction of, or in association with any criminal street gang, with the specific intent 186.22, subd. people v. sok (2010) 181 cal.app.4th 88, 92, fn. 3.) 12 evidence to support an enhancement, we review the entire record in the light most favorable to the judgment to determine whether it contains substantial evidencethat is, evidence that is reasonable, credible, and of solid valuefrom which a reasonable trier of fact could find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. (people v. wilson (2008) 44 cal.4th 758, 806.) we presume every fact in support of the judgment the trial of fact could have reasonably deduced from the evidence. (ibid.) if the circumstances warranted simply because the circumstances might also reasonably be reconciled with a contrary finding. (people v. lindberg ibid.people v. albillar (2010) 51 cal.4th 47, 59-60; accord, people v. powell (2011) 194 cal.app.4th 1268, the requirement that the crime to be enhanced be committed for the benefit of, at the offense is subject to increased punishment under the [street terrorism enforcement and people v. gardeley (1996) (people v. albillar, supra, 51 cal.4th at pp. 59-60; accord, people v. galvez (2011) 195 cal.app.4th 1253, 1260.) there was substantial evidence defendants were active, documented gang members. further the crimes were committed in gang territory. defendants do not dispute that evidence. and the parties stipulated that street gang as defined in section 186.22, subdivision (f). there also was substantial evidence defendants perpetrated the offenses with fellow gang members. further, the prosecution could properly present opinion testimony to the effect that the crimes were committed to benefit the gang. (people v. gutierrez (2009) 45 cal.4th 789, 820; people v. hernandez (2004) 33 cal.4th 1040, 1047-1048; people v. gardeley, supra, 14 cal.4th 13 at pp. 617-620.) detective flores testified: gang members commit violent acts to gain respect for themselves; the acts are also committed to benefit the gang; the crimes elevate their individual status in the gang and raise the level of fear in the community; and this in turn makes it easier for gang members to commit crimes. detective flores was presented with hypothetical questions closely tracking the facts of the present offenses. the gang-related. detective flores testified the grand theft person offense was committed for the benefit of the gang. detective flores reasoned: it was committed in broad daylight in territory claimed by an allied gang; it served to generate fear in the community to both crimes for their gang and for the alliance; any profits would benefit both the individuals and the gang community; gang members commonly loiter in locations potential victims may frequent, such as the arco gas station; the crime was preplanned; one perpetrator good friends who commit a lot of crimes together; and the perpetrators demonstrated they had the ability to commit violent crime. also in response to hypothetical questions, detective flores testified that the video game store robbery and murder were committed to benefit the gang because: the offense occurred in an area that was a gang stronghold; gang members were teaching other members to commit crime; two of the gang members had committed crimes together in the past; they solicited the help of a third gang membersomeone they could trust; the crime was preplanned; the crime helped to maintaicreating intimidation and making it easier to commit other offenses; it provided monetary benefit to the gang; gangs need money to, in particular, procure weapons; and the crime nd created respect for the gang and the individuals, making rival members fearful. this testimony in response to hypothetical inquiries provided a proper basis from which the jury could reasonably conclude the crimes people v. vang (2011) 52 cal.4th 1038, 1044-1052; people v. 14 gardeley, supra, 14 cal.4th at p. 619.) the foregoing was substantial evidence the crimes charged were committed to benefit people v. albillar, supra, 51 cal.4th at p. 63; people v. gardeley, supra, 14 cal.4th at p. 619; people v. mendez (2010) 188 cal.app.4th 47, 56-58.) 2. accomplice testimony corroboration mr. alvarez contends mr. bingley was an accomplice whose testimony required corroboration. it is well settled that accomplice testimony must be corroborated. ( 1111; people v. gonzales and soliz, supra, 52 cal.4th at pp. 303-304; people v. guiuan (1998) 18 cal.4th 558, 570.) however, as our supreme court explained in gonzales: people v. hayes (1999) 21 ient if it tends to connect the defendant with (people v. fauber people v. gonzales and soliz, supra, 52 cal.4th at p. 303.) similarly, in people v. nelson (2011) 51 cal.4th 198, 218, our consideration when standing alone. however, it must tend to implicate the defendant by relating to an act that is an element of the crime. it need not by itself establish every is binding on review unless the corroborating evidence should not have been admitted or does not reasonably tend to connect the defendant with the commission of the crime. (people v. abilez (2007) 41 cal.4th 472, 505; [people v.] mcdermott [(2002)] 28 cal.4th [946,] there was sufficient evidence in the present case connecting mr. alvarez with the robbery and murder at the video game store. mr. alvarez and mr. frazier were members of the same gang. mr. m, 15 evidence the two were closely allied. mr. alvarez and mr. frazier, who was clearly identified as a perpetrator of the video game store crimes, had recently jointly committed grand theft against ms. caldwell. during the commission of that grand theft, mr. alvarez drove a black dodge intrepid. mr. bingley testified mr. alvarez drove a black dodge intrepid to the video game store. mr. frazier was later detained from a black dodge intrepid driven by mr. alvarez. and police later recovered a black dodge intrepid at mr. one of the three perpetrators of the robbery and murder walked with a pronounced limp. mr. alvarez had a pronounced limp. the trial court observed that the video-taped image of the person with a pronounced limp matched mr. video games that could have been stolen in the robbery were found in mr. residence. that a copy of one game was also found tended to suggest duplication for purposes of sale. the foregoing evidence reasonably tended to connect mr. alvarez with the crimes committed at the video game store such that the jury could conclude mr. bingley told the truth. 3. the robbery-murder special circumstance finding mr. alvarez challenges the felony-murder special circumstance finding on grounds there was no substantial evidence he aided and abetted the robbery as a major participant with reckless indifference for human life. ( 190.2, subd. (d); see people v. thompson (2010) 49 cal.4th 79, 125-126; people v. estrada (1995) 11 cal.4th 568, 571-572, 575.) mr. alvarez reasons he had left the store during the robbery. only then did mr. bishara walk in. further, mr. alvarez asserts there was no reason to believe mr. frazier intended to use the handgun other than to restrain the employees and rob the store. activititison v. arizona (1987)] 481 u.s. [137,] 16 157) . . . people v. estrada, supra, 11 cal.4th at p. 577; accord, people v. mil (2012) be subjectively aware that his or her participation in the felony involved a grave risk of people v. estrada, supra, people v mil, supra, 53 cal.4th at p. 417.) here, mr. alvarez participated in the robbery with knowledge mr. frazier was armed and actively employing the firearm to subdue and restrain the employees. mr. alvarez was in the store when mr. frazier wielded the gun. mr. alvarez and mr. bingley duct-taped the two employees while mr. frazier pointed the gun at them. the use of a weapon to effect the robbery presented a grave risk of death. this was substantial evidence mr. alvarez knowingly engaged in criminal activity involving a grave risk of death. (people v. mil, supra, 53 cal.4th at p. 417; people v. lopez (2011) 198 cal.app.4th 1106, 1115-1116; people v. bustos (1994) 23 cal.app.4th 1747, 1751, 1754-1755.) c. evidence admitted or excluded 1. third party culpability evidence defendants assert it was prejudicial error to exclude evidence from which the jury could have found a third party, kenneth chatman, was one of the video game store robbers. we disagree. the trial court did not abuse its discretion in ruling the proffered evidence did not either directly or circumstantially connect mr. chatman to the actual perpetration of the robbery homicide. (see people v. mcwhorter (2009) 47 cal.4th 318, 372-people v. avila in people v. hall admissible, . . . third-oof of 17 le culpability. . . . [e]vidence of mere motive or opportunity to commit the crime in another guilt: there must be direct or circumstantial evidence linking the third person to the people v. vines (2011) 51 cal.4th 830, 860; people v. mcwhorter, supra, 47 cal.4th at pp. 367-368.) further, third party culpability evidence is treated like any other evidence; it is admissible if relevant (evid. code,  350) unless it is excludable pursuant to evidence code section 352. (people v. mcwhorter, supra, 47 cal.4th at pp. 367-368, 372-373; people v. hall, supra, 41 cal.3d at p. 834.) in mcwhorter, o be admissible, evidence of the culpability of a third party offered by a defendant to demonstrate that a reasonable doubt exists concerning his or her guilt, must link the third person either directly or circumstantially to the actual perpetration of the crime. in assessing an offer of proof related to such evidence, the court must decide whether the evidence could raise a prejudicial than probative under evidence code sepeople v. mcwhorter, supra, 47 cal.4th at pp. 367-368; see people v. lynch, supra, 50 cal.4th at p. 756.) defense counsel made an offer of proof as follows. first, boris garcia would testify that on september 3, 2004the day of the robbery homicide at the video game storemr. chatman, a gang member, walked into the tattoo parlor. the tattoo parlor was next door to the video game store. mr. chatman was carrying a paintball gun. during a conversation, mr. chatman said he could rob somebody with it. second, detective lait would testify as to a conversation with mr. chatman. according to mr. chatman, he was solicited to rob the video game store. the offer was made by mr. harris, a fellow gang member. mr. harris and mr. chatman then cased the store. but in the conversation with detective lait, mr. chatman denied participating in any robbery. third, mr. harris would testify to having asked mr. chatman to case the video 18 game store. according to mr. harris, they were going to case the video game store together. mr. harris admitted giving mr. chatman a roll of duct tape to hold while they did so. fourth, one month after the robbery, mr. secord identified mr. chatman in a photographic lineup as someone who had been around the strip mall the day of the robbery. according to mr. secord, mr. chatman was wearing a hard plastic face mask commonly used in paintball competitions. the prosecution argued there was no evidence mr. chatman was involved in the robbery homicide. according to the prosecutor: mr. secord was familiar with mr. chatman; mr. secord had seen mr. chatman wearing a mask earlier on the day of the robbery; mr. secord did not identify mr. chatman as one of the robbers; and mr. secord said the mask worn by one of the perpetrators was not the one mr. chatman had been wearing earlier. finally, the prosecutor argued mr. bingley also did not identify mr. chatman as one of the perpetrators. the trial court tentatively ruled the proffered evidence did not raise a reasonable contemplated by mr. chatman and mr. harris ever occurred; the robbery that did occur was not committed by any individual wearing a paintball mask; no perpetrator of the robbery homicide wielded a paintball gun; the accomplice, mr. bingley, never named either mr. harris or mr. chatman as a perpetrator of the robbery; and mr. secord did not identify mr. chatman as one of the robbers. prior to issuing a final ruling, the trial court allowed the defense to call mr. chatman, mr. harris and ms. harmon to testify under evidence code section 402. mr. chatman asserted his fifth amendment right and refused to testify. the trial court observed that mr. ce was covered with tattoos; moreover, the tattoos predated the robbery. mr. harris denied knowing mr. chatman or ms. harmon. mr. harris also denied having cased the video game store with mr. chatman. ms. harmon denied telling the detectives that mr. harris had come to her house saying he planned to rob the video game store. 19 with respect to mr. possibility . . . that in reality mr. chatman was involved in that robbery. i say that because he is so distinctive that there is no reasonable possibility that anybody would misidentify anybody in this case for him. [] that being the case, his alleged involvement is . . . not capable of raising a reasonable doubt . . . concluded the marginal relevance of the testimony as to mr. chatman was outweighed by reference whatever to mr. section] 352, the time consumed would include then trotting mr. chatman into the courtroom and dealing with that whole issue to disprove any allegation that, in fact, he as noted above, evidence was offered at trial that mr. harris and an unidentified accomplice (not either of defendants) had, prior to the robbery homicide, while carrying duct tape, cased the video game store. there was also evidence that prior to the robbery homicide, mr. harris had paid a visit to ms. harmon, who lived near the store. mr. harris told ms. harmon he planned to rob the store and asked her for bags, rope and gloves. mr. harris returned several days later, after the robbery and murder had occurred. when questioned by ms. harmon, mr. harris denied robbing the store. at trial, ms. harmon said she had no recollection of talking to detective lait. also at trial, mr. harris denied he had been at ms. cased the video game store. also at trial, mr. secord identified a photograph of mr. further, mr. secord testified mr. secord never identified mr. chatman as a participant in the robbery. the trial court did not err prejudicially when it excluded evidence pertaining to mr. chatman to the actual robbery homicide. there was no evidence any perpetrator wielded a paintball gun. there was no testimony a perpetrator of the robbery homicide wore a paintball mask of the type mr. chatman had been seen wearing. mr. secord was familiar with 20 mr. chatman. mr. secord did not identify mr. chatman as a participant in or possible perpetrator of the robbery homicide. the accomplice, mr. bingley, never named mr. chatman as one of the robbers. no witness described a person with tattoos covering his face as having been involved. that mr. chatman considered robbing the video game store at or about the same time the present robbery occurred was not evidence linking him to the actual perpetration of the crime. that mr. chatman and defendants were fellow gang members changes nothing in the context of abuse of discretion review on our part. there was no evidence mr. chatman and mr. harris ever robbed the video game relevance, that presenting itincluding calling mr. garcia and mr. chatman to testifywould require an undue consumption of time. 2. the note over defense objection, the trial court admitted evidence mr. bingley, while incarcerated, had been given a handwritten note. the note threatened to harm mr. bingley or his family members if he testified in the present case. there was also evidence the note might have been written by an inmate with pro. per. privileges, a status mr. frazier had enjoyed. defendants assert it was prejudicial error to allow the evidence absent testimony either defendant authorized the note. a trial court exercises broad discretion in the admission or exclusion of evidence. (people v. scott (2011) 52 cal.4th 452, 490; people v. richardson (2008) 43 cal.4th 959, 1000-1001.) here, the trial court could properly rule mr. stimony was suspect because he gave it in return for leniency. and the trial court could reasonably find evidence of the threat against mr. bingley bore on his credibility even if the threat was not linked to defendants. (people v. mendoza (2011) 52 cal.4th 1056, 1084; people v. green (1980) 27 cal.3d 1, 20, disapproved on other points in people v. martinez (1999) 20 cal.4th 225, 233-237, and people v. hall (1986) 41 cal.3d 826, 834, fn. 3; see people v. guerra (2006) 37 cal.4th 1067, 1142.) there was no abuse of discretion. 21 3. the in-person lineup identification the video game store robbery occurred on september 3, 2004. on october 1, 2004, mr. secord, the store employee, identified mr. frazier in a photographic lineup. mr. frazier was arrested on december 7, 2004, in connection with the robberies of mr. coleman and mr. severe. the trial court subsequently ordered mr. frazier, who was in custody, to participate in an in-person lineup. at the april 21, 2005 in-person lineup, mr. secord positively identified mr. frazier as a perpetrator of the robbery homicide at the video game store. mr. secord was 100 percent certain of his identifications. mr. secord hesitated only because mr. fraz secord did not see the apparent birthmark at the time of the robbery. evidence was subsequently introduced that the mark was the result of an abrasion mr. frazier suffered at the time of his arrest. mr. frazier moved to suppress mr. -person lineup identification. mr. frazier argued the trial court lacked authority to order him to participate in the lineup. on appeal, mr. frazier argues it was error to deny the motion to suppress the in-person lineup identification. mr. frazier relies on goodwin v. superior court (2001) 90 cal.app.4th 215, 221-226. in goodwin, we held the respondent court had no jurisdiction to ex parte order a suspect who was out of custody and charged with no crimes to appear at a lineup. (id. at pp. 221-226.) goodwin is inapposite. mr. frazier was in custody and charged with crimes when the in-person lineup occurred. and there was reasonable cause to believe mr. frazier had participated in the video game store robbery homicide. mr. secord had made a photographic lineup identification of mr. frazier. (people v. sequeira (1981) 126 cal.app.3d 1, 13.) further, mr. frazier had no constitutional due process or self-incrimination right to refrain from participating in the lineup. (united states v. wade (1967) 388 u.s. 218, 222-223; people v. johnson (1992) 3 cal.4th 1183, 1220-1222; goodwin v. superior court, supra, 90 cal.app.4th at p. 220.) the trial court did not err in denying mr. identification at the live lineup. 22 d. prosecutorial misconduct defendants argue the prosecutor made comments in closing argument about dr. that character . . . dr. shomer who got on the stand? we paid him over a million dollars overwell, $800,000 over the past ten years to get on the stand and say some of the stuff icipate they are going to talk a little bit about their star witness that we paid way too much money for, mr. shomer defendants forfeited this contention by failing to object on any ground. any tatements could have been cured by an admonition.

(strickland v. washington (1984) 466 u.s. 668, 697; people v. lawley (2002) 27 cal.4th 102, 136; people v. fairbank (1997) 16 cal.4th 1223, 1241.) the case against mr. frazier was compelling. mr. identified him. mr. bingley, whose testimony as an accomplice was adequately corroborated, placed mr. frazier at the scene of the video game store robbery. and mr. bingley identified mr. frazier as the person who fired the fatal shot. the brief nonspecific references to mr. 24 front of the jury. it is not reasonably probable the outcome would have been more favorable to mr. frazier had mr. murphy moved to redact the remarks or requested an admonition. f. jury instruction 1. robbery-murder special circumstance: caljic no. 8.81.17 instructions as murder in the commission of robbery is true, it must be proved: [] 1a. the murder was committed while a defendant was engaged in or was an accomplice in the commission or attempted commission of a robbery; or [] 1b. the murder was committed during the immediate flight after the commission or attempted commission of sic.] (caljic was committed in order to carry out or advance the commission of the crime of [robbery] or to facilitate the escape therefrom or to avoid detection. in other words, the special circumstance referred to in these instructions is not established if the [robbery] was merely in defendants assert it was prejudicial error to omit the language in paragraph 2. they reason there was a factual issue whether the robbery was incidental to the murder. they contend the omitted language concerned a necessary element of the special circumstance allegation and the failure to include it violated their constitutional rights. having failed to request that the omitted language be included, defendants have forfeited this argument.

(people v. bonnetta (2009) 46 cal.4th 143, 156; auto equity sales, inc. v. superior court (1962) 57 cal.2d 450, 455.) further, here as in riel, people v. riel, supra, 22 cal.4th at p. 1200, citing people v. brown (1996) 42 cal.app.4th 1493, 1502-1503.) defendants argue the trial court had a sua sponte duty to give an additional on . . . charged crimes. without this additional instruction concerning common membership and the use of a gang apparatus, they argue the special allegation cannot be sustained. 26 defendants rely on people v. albillar, supra, 51 cal.4th at page 60. this argument misconstrues albillar. our supreme court was not there giving a technical, legal meaning to the statutory language. nor have defendants shown that the statutory 186.22, subd.
