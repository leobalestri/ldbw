(pen. code,  2112.) the district attorney also charged carranza with short barreled shotgun or rifle activity (former  12020, subd. (a)(1), now  33215) and assault with a firearm ( 245, subd. (a)(2)). as to the robberies, the district attorney alleged that a principal was armed with a firearm ( 12022, subd. (a)(1)); that a principal personally used a firearm ( 12022.53, subds. (b) & (e)(1)); and that the robberies were committed for the benefit of, at the direction of, and in association with a criminal street gang with the specific intent to promote, further, and assist in criminal conduct by gang members ( 186.22, subd. (b)(1)(c).) the district attorney further alleged that carranza personally used a firearm in the commission of all of the offenses ( 12022.5, subd. (a)) and that he committed the short barreled shotgun or rifle activity and assault with a firearm offenses for the benefit of, at the direction of, and in association with a criminal street gang with the specific intent to promote, further, and assist in criminal conduct by gang members ( 186.22, subd.

(a)(2)). the jury found true the allegation as to aguirre that a principal was armed with a firearm in the commission of the robberies. ( 12022, subd. (a)(1).) as to carranza, the jury found true the allegations that carranza personally used a firearm in the commission of the robberies ( 12022.53, subd. (b)) and in the commission of the assault with a firearm ( 12022.5). the jury was unable to reach findings on the gang sentence enhancement allegations as to all offenses ( 186.22, subd. (b)(1)(c)) or on the personal use of firearm allegations ( 12022.53, subds. (b)(1)(b) & (e)(1)) as to the robberies, and the trial court declared a mistrial as to those allegations. the trial court sentenced aguirre to five years and carranza to 15 years in state prison. on appeal, aguirre contends that the trial court erred in denying his request to instruct the jury with calcrim no. 1750 on receiving stolen property as a lesser related offense to robbery; the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury, sua sponte, with calcrim no. 1603 on aider and abettor intent for robbery; and there is insufficient evidence to support his convictions for robbery. carranza contends that the trial court erred in denying his wheeler/batson3 motion, and there is insufficient evidence to support his convictions and the personal use of a firearm findings. carranza joins in 3 people v. wheeler (1978) 22 cal.3d 258 (wheeler); batson v. kentucky (1986) 476 u.s. 79 (batson). 4 factual background4 about 5:45 p.m. on november 18, 2010, luis solis, jorge c., and israel r. were 5 stopped abruptly in front of companions. the men were carrying guns in their hands and lifted their shirts to partially and removed his iphone and earphones. carranza also pointed hicarranza and his companion ran back to the suv and got in the back. jorge and israel and called the police who arrived in about 10 or 15 minutes. los angeles county deputy sheriff alejandro lomeli spoke with solis, jorge, and israel for about 15 to 20 minutes. according to deputy lomeli, all three boys were iption of stop sign.6 deputy lomeli and other officers executed a traffic stop of the suv. aguirre, anthony ibarra, and carranza were inside the vehicle. aguirre was in the passenger seat. 4 we omit a recitation of the gang evidence because the jury did not return findings on the gang allegations and defendants have not raised on appeal any issues with respect to those allegations. 5 6 5 aguirre was ordered out of the suv. deputy lomeli searched aguirre and found an iphone in his right front pants pocket. aguirre was placed in a patrol car. ibarra and carranza also were ordered out of the suv and placed in patrol cars. during the traffic stop, deputy lomeli found a sprint samsung cell phone near the vehicle, about two feet from the rear passenger door. solis, jorge, and israel were brought to the location to view the suspects. all three of their identifications. none of the boys could identify aguirre. all three boys identified the suv as the vehicle that had been used in the robberies. deputy lomeli showed the iphone to solis. solis recognized the iphone as his and identified telephone numbers in the iphone. deputy lomeli showed the samsung cell phone to israel. israel discussion i. sufficiency of the evidence aguirre and carranza contend that their convictions and the firearm sentence enhancements are not supported by sufficient evidence. sufficient evidence supports the convictions and firearm enhancements. sufficiency of the evidence to support a conviction, we review the entire record in the light most favorable to the judgment to determine whether it contains substantial evidencethat is, evidence that is reasonable, credible, and of solid valuefrom which a reasonable trier of fact could find the people v. avila (2009) 46 cal.4th 680, 701.) (people v. medina unwarranted people v. zamudio sufficiency of the evidence, a reviewing 6 court resolves neither credibility issues nor evidentiary conflicts. [citation.] resolution of conflicts and inconsistencies in the testimony is the exclusive province of the trier of people v. young (2005) 34 cal.4th 1149, 1181.) ce includes circumstantial evidence and the reasonable people v. ugalino (2009) 174 cal.app.4th 1060, 1064.) circumstantial evidence.

(people v. avila, supra, 46 cal.4th at p. 701; people v. medina, supra, 46 cal.4th at p. 919; people v. zamudio, supra, 43 cal.4th at pp. 357-358; people v. valdez, supra, 32 cal.4th at p. 104; people v. ugalino, supra, 174 cal.app.4th at p. 1064.) ion of the robberies did not depend on evidence that aguirre was personally armed. section person who is armed with a firearm in the commission of a felony or attempted felony shall be punished by an additional and consecutive term of imprisonment pursuant to subdivision (h) of section 1170 for one year, unless the arming is an element of that offense. this additional term shall apply to any person who is a principal in the commission of a felony or attempted felony if one or more of the principals is armed with a firearm, whether or not the person is personally armed with a firearm.accordingly, because ibarra and carranza were armed with firearms (see below did not need to be personally armed for section 12022, subdivision (a)(1) to apply. b. carranza carranza contends that there is insufficient evidence to support his second degree robbery and assault with a firearm convictions because the identification evidence is weak.7 the evidence is weak, carranza contends, because the two men who were carrying guns partially concealed their faces, the victims viewed the suspects briefly as the robbery lasted only five minutes. jorge identified carranza at the preliminary hearing 7 it appears that carranza does not contend that insufficient evidence supports his short barreled shotgun activity conviction. if his convictions are not reversed, carranza requests that they be reduced to receiving stolen property. because we find substantial evidence that carranza was guilty of second degree robbery, there is no basis for reducing his offenses to receiving stolen property. 8 as the person who robbed him, but identified aguirre at trial as the robber. with respect carranza notes, jorge testified that the the trial. as to the firearm enhancements, carranza argues that the evidence is insufficient because no guns were found. that the evidence is weak is shown, carranza contends, by the fact that the first jury was unable to reach verdicts on the robbery charges and firearm enhancements. substantial evidence was presented that carranza was one of the perpetrators. carranza was stopped in the suv that was used in the robberies. property taken during deputy lomeli testified that at the field show up solis, jorge, and israel identified carranza as one of the two gunmen. according to lomeli, the boys did not hesitate in identified carranza as one of the gunmen. israel testified at trial that carranza pointed a gun at jorge. such evidence is sufficient for a reasonable juror to conclude that carranza was one of the assailants and that he personally used a firearm in the robberies and in sufficient time (people v. young, supra, 34 cal.4th at p. 1181.) carranza cites no case that holds that there is insufficient evidence to support a firearm enhancement if law enforcement was unable to recover the firearm. instead, weapon.

(auto equity sales, inc. v. superior court (1962) 57 cal.2d 450, 455.) accordingly, the trial court did not err in denying defense even if the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury with calcrim no. 1750, any error was harmless. from the evidence recited above, it is not reasonably probable that aguirre would have received a more favorable outcome if the jury had been instructed with calcrim no. 1750.
