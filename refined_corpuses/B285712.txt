(a)(1)) law ( 667, subds. (b)-(j), 1170.12, subds. (a)-(d)) as well as a 3 2 all further statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise indicated. 3 the people also charged defendant with assault with a deadly weapon for an incident involving a different victim a few trial court dismissed the other charge after the people announced they were unable to proceed, and the people did not re-allege the 1998 assault in the operative information. 4 the matter proceeded to a jury trial. the trial court instructed the jury on first degree murder, the lesser included offense of voluntary manslaughter (based on imperfect self-defense), and the defense of self-defense. the jury convicted defendant of voluntary manslaughter and found the personal use allegation true. the trial court subsequently found the prior conviction allegation to be true. the trial court sentenced defendant to 27 years in state prison. in calculating this sentence, the court imposed 22 years for the voluntary manslaughter count (comprised of a high-end sentence of 11 years, doubled due to the prior strike) plus five years for the prior serious felony. the court stayed the dangerous weapon enhancement. defendant filed this timely appeal. discussion direct appeal i. batson/wheeler challenge defendant argues that the trial court erred in overruling against juror no. 23 violated batson v. kentucky (1986) 476 u.s. 79 (batson) and people v. wheeler (1978) 22 cal.3d 258 (wheeler). people v. harris (2013) 57 cal.4th 804, 834.) a. pertinent facts defendant is hispanic. the prospective pool of jurors was after 60 prospective jurors were questioned by the trial three jurors for cause and the parties stipulated to excuse a fourth juror. the parties then began to exercise their peremptory 5 challenges. the prosecutor exercised eight challenges before accepting the panel. when the court was forced to excuse two jurors from the accepted (but not yet sworn) panel, jury selection resumed, and the prosecutor struck a ninth juror. defendant at that point made a batson/wheeler objection. the peremptory challenges had been exercised against prospective of discrimi the court then asked the prosecutor to offer his reasons for excusing the six hispanic jurorsjuror nos. 2, 10, 19, 23, 28, and 37. the prosecutor explained that he excused the first three jurors (juror nos. 2, 10 and 19) due to their the prosecutor explained that he excused juror no. 28 because he had expressed a negative view of law enforcement, as shown t he excused he would vote not guilty based on how calm he perceived the prosecutors explained that they excused juror no. 23 because that - gang while -in-chiefcould still come into the trial court asked the prospective jurors a general question 6 - and overruled the batson/wheeler objection. as a general stated reasons. and specifically as to juror no. 23, the record indicated that (1) juror no. 23 did not speak up when the court had asked the pool of prospective jurors whether very close to you [had] . . . ever been the victim of a crime of ed that he a soccer game . . . against . . . a couple of gang members, and . . . we ended up getting in a physical fight with them, and . . . one of them ended up stabbing one of our players, and then . . . everyone analysis of whether the prosecutor had retained other non-had the same kind of or even really close to the same kind of noted that the jury had at least three jurors of hispanic ethnicity when the prosecutor had accepted the panel. b. analysis although a prosecutor may exercise a peremptory challenge people v. scott (2015) 61 cal.4th 363, 387 (scott)), he jurors on the basis of group bias 7 of an identifiable group distinguished on racial, religious, ethnic people v. bell (2007) 40 cal.4th 582, protection set forth in batson, supra, 476 u.s. 79, and his state right to a trial by a jury drawn from a representative cross-section of the community under article i, section 16 of the california constitution set forth in wheeler, supra, 22 cal.3d at p. 272. (accord, people v. gutierrez (2017) 2 cal.5th 1150, 1157 (gutierrez).) although a defendant bears the ultimate burden of showing a constitutional violation (people v. lenix (2008) 44 cal.4th 602, 612-613), trial courts employ a three-step, burden-shifting mechanism in assessing whether a batson/wheeler violation has by showing that the totality of the relevant facts gives rise to an inference of discriminatory purpose in the exercise of peremptory (scott, supra, 61 cal.4th at p. 383.) if the court finds that the defendant has established this prima facie case, excusing the juror by offering permissible, nondiscriminatory justifications. (ibid.) the court must finally reasoned effort to evaluate . . . the nondiscriminatory people v. williams (2013) 56 cal.4th 630, 650), subjectively genuine or instead a pretext for discrimination. (scott, supra, 61 cal.4th at p. 383; people v. duff (2014) 58 cal.4th 527, 548; people v. jones (2013) 57 cal.4th 899, 917.) because the trial court found that defendant had crimination and asked the prosecution its reasons for excusing the six hispanic jurors, the 8 batson/wheeler ruling turns on for excusing juror no. 23the only excusal defendant challenges on appeal we independently conclude that they were. the prosecution cited four reasons for excusing juror no. 23his involvement in a knife fight similar to the charged offense where self-defense was arguably at issue, his familiarity with gangs (as shown by his willingness to play team sports against them), his him had been a victim of a crime of violence when one of his teammates had been stabbed, and his youth, parental and marital status and profession. each of these is a legitimate, non-discriminatory basis to excuse a juror. (see people v. cox (2010) -people v. williams (1997) 16 cal.4th 153, 191 [same]; people v. adanandus people v. perez (1994) 29 - people v. barber (1988) 200 cal.app.3d 378, 394 [profession is race neutral].) defendant offers what boil down to five reasons why the trial court erred in rejecting his batson/wheeler challenge. ing juror no. 23 were not sincere because (1) the first prosecutor juror no. 23 never said he was involved in the fight at the soccer ) both members, but the court had excluded all gang evidence; and (3) 9 the prosecution gave some of its reasons (those dealing with the soccer game) initially and proffered additional reasons (those job and life experience) only after the court asked for further reasons. none of these arguments calls into question the te juror we ended up getting in a with them. the prosecutor candidly acknowledged that gang evidence would not be coming in as part of their case-in-chief, but correctly noted that the court might revisit that ruling if defendant chose to e additional legitimacy of the reasons that came before or after the request, at least where they are supported by the record and consistent with one another. second, defendant contends that comparative juror analysis shows that the prosecutor was singling out juror no. 23 due to his ethnicity. in particular, defendant notes that the prosecutor (1) did not strike juror nos. 33 and 40 even though they were involved in violence, (2) did not strike juror nos. 3, 13, and 404 even though they were young or not professionals, and (3) struck juror nos. 30, 37 and 47 even though they were strikes using consistent criteria can reveal an ulterior, race-based 4 defendant also cites juror no. 8, but the defense struck that juror. 10 gutierrez, supra, 2 cal.5th at p. 1173.) none of the jurors defendant points tojuror nos. 3, 13, 30, 33, 37, 40, or 47was involved in a fight with gang members where a knife was pulled, someone was stabbed, and the juror fled. and juror nos. 33 and 40 were not personally involved in any violence: by a drunk driver decades earlier. in sum, the differential treatment of these jurors by the prosecution accordingly reveals excusing juror no. 23 are pretextual because he did not ask juror questions can be evidence of pretext when the party excuses the juror on a basis without eliciting information from that juror to justify the excusal on that basis. (people v. chaney (1991) 234 cal.app.3d 853, 860; davidson v. harris (8th cir. 1994) 30 f.3d 963, 966; u.s. v. odeneal (6th cir. 2008) 517 f.3d 406, 420-421.) but where, as here, the information to justify the excusal is already part of the record through questioning by the court or the other party, the failure to ask additional questions is of no consequence. (people v. arellano (2016) 245 cal.app.4th 1139, 1163 (arellano).) residence as a proxy for race (e.g., people v. turner (2001) 90 cal.app.4th 413, 420; united states v. bishop (1992) 959 f.2d 11 820, 825-826), but youth, life experience and career choice have yet to be deemed impermissible proxies. to the contrary, and as noted above, they are legitimate bases for peremptory challenges. lastly, defendant asserts that arellano, supra, 245 cal.app.4th 1139 dictates a ruling in his favor. it does not. in arellanoke of an african-american juror after the prosecutor denied the juror was african-american and alternatively offered a reason for the strike that was unsupported by the record. (id. at pp. 1165-1169.) here, the prosecution acknowledged that juror no. 23 was hispanic and each of its reasons for excusing that juror were grounded in the record. ii. instructional error defendant introduced medical records documenting that, five days before the charged incident, he went to the emergency room and was treated ftreated with a suture. defendant had also told the officers he spoke to on the night of the stabbing that he had been recently stabbed, including in the arm. to the officers, however, defendant did not appear to be injured. on the basis of the medical records and his statements, defendant argues that the trial court erred in not (1) tailoring the standard calcrim 505 self-defense instruction to tell the jurors to consider what a instruction calcrim 3429 pertaining to persons with physical disabilities. we review these instructional errors de novo. (people v. posey (2004) 32 cal.4th 193, 218.) 12 a. tailoring self-defense instruction the standard self-defense instruction, which was given in this case, states that the defense is only available if, among other things, the (calcrim no. 505.) the instruction further explains that they were known to and appeared to the defendant and consider what a reasonable person in a similar situation with similar knowledge would have believedibid., italics added.) defendant asserts that the trial court should have added the italicized language to account for the evidence of his medical condition at the time of the charged crime. instruction. (people v. ward (2005) 36 cal.4th 186, 214-215.) a trial court has no duty to give a pinpoint instruction until and unless the defendant requests one. (people v. wilkins (2013) 56 cal.4th 333, 348-349.) defendant did not request one in this case, so the trial court did not err in declining to give this instruction. recognizing this deficiency, defendant argues that his trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective for not requesting the pinpoint instruction he now proposes on appeal. an attorney provides constitutionally ineffective assistance if (1) his representation is deficient, and (2) prejudice flows from that 13 deficient representation. (strickland v. washington (1984) 466 u.s. 668, 688, 692.) defendant has not satisfied either requirement necessary to a finding of ineffective assistance. his counsel was not defiphysical and mental afflictions in assessing what a reasonable person in his situation would believe (e.g., people v. smith (1907) 151 cal. 619, 627-diseaspeople v. humphrey (1996) 13 cal.4th 1073, 1088-1089 standard jury instruction in this case allowed the jurorsand, indeed, required themreasonable person in a similar situation defense counsel did not provide deficient performance by not requesting the pinpoint instruction defendant now proposes because that instruction highlights the defense evidenceand only the defense evidenceand is accordingly argumentative. (see people v. campos (2007) 156 cal.app.4th 1228, 1244 argumentative].) courts are not to give argumentative pinpoint instructions. (people v. moon (2005) 37 cal.4th 1, 30, 32.) any deficiency was also not prejudicial to defendant. based on the standard instruction, defense counsel was able to forcefully argue during closing that de b. calcrim 3429 disability is required to (know what/use the amount of care that) 14 a reasonably careful person with the same physical disability italics added.) this instruction is derived from people v. mathews (1994) 25 cal.app.4th 89, 94, 98-99, which held that a officers when the defendant was charged with exhibiting a firearm in the presence of a peace officer. the trial court did not err in not giving calcrim 3429 here because it is not relevant to this case. self-defense does not turn on what the defendant mathews language) or distinct inquiries: the former deals with what knowledge should be attributed to the defendant, while the latter deals with the iii. sentencing issue on september 30, 2018, the governor signed senate bill 1393, which amends section 1385 to eliminate the prohibition on dismissing section 667, subd. (a). ( 1385, subd. (b) (2018 ed.); sen. bill no. 1393 (2017-2018 reg. sess.)  2.) because this new law grants a trial court the discretion to mitigate or reduce a criminal sentence, it applies retroactively to all nonfinal convictions unless the legislature has expressed a contrary intent. (people v. francis (1969) 71 cal.2d 66, 75-78; in re estrada (1965) 63 cal.2d 740, 744-745.) our legislature has expressed no such intent in se 15 is entitled to have the trial court exercise its newfound discretion ted . . . that it aware of having the discretion to do so. (people v. mcdaniels (2018) 22 cal.app.5th 420, 425.) here, there is no such indication. the court made no express statements to that effect, and although the court selected a high-term base sentence, the court also stayed the personal use enhancement. on these facts, a remand is appropriate. petition for habeas corpus in his separately filed petition for a writ of habeas corpus, defendant argues that his trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective for (1) not requesting the two jury instructions discussed above, (2) not conducting further investigation that would have uncovered more detailed medical records regarding his condition after the knife fight a few days before the charged physical strength at the time of the charged crime and that the prior incident occurred in the same location as the charged crime, and (3) not introducing into evidence the additional records and testimony. the first argument lacks merit for the reasons discussed above. the remaining two arguments turn on investigate and introduce the evidence was deficient and that, absent this deficient performance, there is a reasonable probability of a different outcome at trial. (strickland, supra, 466 u.s. at 688, 692; people v. mai (2013) 57 cal.4th 986, 1009.) even if we assume fperformance was deficient, it is not reasonably probable that the 16 introduction of the additional medical records and witnesses would have led to a different outcome. the jury already had in ments that he had been recently specifics of his injuries. further, defense counsel argued to the jury that this evidence should be considered in assessing whether defendant reasonably stabbed wayne in self-defense. defendant asserts that the jury may have viewed the medical records witness explained them to the jury, but counsel explained their significance to the jury. the additional medical records and witnesses are also in many respects cumulative of the evidence already before the jury. what is more, introduction of this further evidence may well have backfired by prompting the jury tercation in the exact same strip mall just days before as proofnot of self-defensebut of his penchant for (or his provocation of) violence. 17 disposition the judgment is affirmed, but the matter is remanded to the trial court to consider whether to exercise its discretion under senate bill 1393. the petition for a writ of habeas corpus is denied. not to be published in the official reports. ________________________, j. hoffstadt we concur: ___________________________, p.j. lui ___________________________, j. ashmann-gerst
