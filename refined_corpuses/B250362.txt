(people v. kelly (2006) 40 cal.4th 106, 109110; people v. wende (1979) 25 cal.3d 436, 441.) defendants claims raised in his supplemental brief relating to his judgment of conviction were addressed in a prior appeal and are not cognizable in this appeal from the postjudgment order recalculating his sentencing credits. (in re carpenter (1995) 9 cal.4th 634, 646 [appellate jurisdiction limited to four corners of record on appeal].) any claims not addressed in his prior appeal may be cognizable through the vehicle of a habeas corpus petition where appropriate evidence may be presented.
