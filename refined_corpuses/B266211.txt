(a)(17)(l)) and burglary ( 190.2, subd. (a)(17)(g)); one count of attempted carjacking ( 664, 215, subd. (a)); and one count of first-degree residential burglary ( 459). for each count, the jury also found a variety of firearm enhancements true ( 12022.53, subds. (b) (e)(1)). (people v. reese (mar. 7, 2007, b186147) [nonpub. opn.] at p. 2.) defendant was a juvenile offender when the crimes were committed. on september 15, 2005, the trial court sentenced him to 25 years to life and imposed a $10,000 restitution fine. the judgment was affirmed on appeal. (people v. reese (mar. 7, 2007, b186147) [nonpub. opn.].) on june 25, 2015, defendant filed bill 260. the court denied the motion on july 20, 2015. defendant filed a timely notice of appeal from that order on august 10, 2015. on december 9, 2015, appointed appellate counsel filed a brief in which she raised no issues and asked us to review the record independently. (people v. wende (1979) 25 cal.3d 436 (wende).) on december 31, 2015, we notified defendant that his counsel had failed to find any arguable issues and that he had 30 days to submit by brief or letter any arguments he wished this court to consider. we have received no response. review on appeal after the sentencing in this case, the legislature passed senate bill no. 260 (20132014 reg. sess.), effective january 1, 2014, which enacted section 3051. (stats. 2013, ch. 312,  4.) section 3051 provides an opportunity for a juvenile offender 1 all undesignated statutory references are to the penal code. 3 to be released on parole irrespective of the sentence imposed by the trial court by a set schedule depending on the length of the prisoner's sentence. relevant here, youth offender parole hearings must be held no later than during the 25th year of incarceration for a prisoner serving a life term of 25 years to life. (id., subd. (b)(3).) thus, under section 3051, defendant would be entitled to a parole hearing on or before september 15, 2030. however, since defendant has not established that he was entitled to a parole hearing by july 20, 2015 when his motion was denied, or less than ten years after he was sentenced, 2 counsel has complied fully with her responsibilities. (smith v. robbins (2000) 528 u.s. 259, 278284 [120 s.ct. 746]; wende, supra, 25 cal.3d at p. 433.) 2 the question of how senate bill no. 260 affects issues of cruel and unusual punishment for youth offenders is currently before our supreme court.
