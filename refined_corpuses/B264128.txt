(f)(1)) and had disobeyed a court order ( 166, subd. (a)(4)). at his arraignment later that same day, bryant pleaded not guilty to both counts. iii. the trial [h]was a serial abuser. in addition to the 2013 and 2014 incidents involving williams, the people introduced evidence regarding a 2007 incident between bryant and his former wife, teresa lopez (lopez). lopez testified that in 2007, during an argument, bryant hit her while she was holding one of their children and then pushed her to the ground and kicked her, sending her to the hospital with scratches, bruises and a swollen bloody lip. a principal theme of the defense was relative credibilitythat is, bryant was more credible than williams. in order to establish that bryant was the more credible witness, the defense employed a two-pronged strategy. first, bryant testified on his own behalf. on the stand, he freely admitted, inter alia, to his prior acts of domestic violence against lopez in 2007 and williams in 2013, accepted and stressed that as to the 2013 incident involving williams, bryant testified that he had pleaded misconduct. the clear implication of this testimony about the prior incidents was that bryant was contesting the 2014 charges because he was not guilty, a point that his 5 counsel made express during closing argument.3 live, in-court testimony with the preliminary hearing testimony of williams, which was read to the jury. the defense utilized the preliminary hearing testimony in which williams admitted lying to the police on several relevant matters, because she elected to invoke her fifth amendment right against self-incrimination and, as a result, the court found her unavailable to testify at trial. to bolster its argument that bryant was the more credible witness, the defense before the presentation of any evidence to the jury, defense counsel announced that he intended to present s prior convictions to impeach the credibility of her statements to the 911 operator. the trial court ruled, over prior record does not after the people rested, the prosecutor submitted to the trial court s , inter alia, that she had suffered felony convictions for receiving stolen property ( 496) in 1998, grand theft ( 487) and receiving stolen property ( 496) in 1999, and receiving stolen property ( 496) in 2001. she had also suffered a misdemeanor conviction for joyriding (veh. code,  10851) in 2008 and a possible conviction in 2013 for disobeying a lawful court order. after williams invoked her fifth amendment privilege against self- 3 with regard to the 2014 incident, bryant testified as follows: williams, after she found suspicious photos on his cell phone, accused him of cheating on her and threatened to send him to jail for violating the 2013 protective order. when bryant heard through the bathroom door that williams was calling 911, he began to s shoes and shirt, in preparation for leaving the apartment, because under the terms of the protective order he was not supposed to be there. as he was preparing to leave the apartment, williams exited the bathroom, pushed him, kicked him, and then hit him in the back with her key chain, scratching his back. when williams hit bryant in the back with her keys, bryant [ed],snapping backward and hitting williams in the face with either the back of his head or his elbow. bryant also admitted that he lied to the police when he told them he had never gone protective order. 6 incrimination outside the presence of the jury, and after the defense read s preliminary hearing testimony to the juryo present evidence of wiprior convictions. once again, the court denied the request, ruling that the defense cannot introduce that the defense on march 2, 2015, the jury, after deliberating for the better part of two days, found bryant guilty on both counts. on may 12, 2015, the court, after striking one of two nine years in state prison. bryant timely appealed. discussion i. the trial court properly excused juror no. 7 on february 25, 2015, the first day that the jury heard evidence, the court received a note from juror number 7 (juror no. 7). the note stated, beliefs and morals, i would not be able to . . . pas[s] judgment[] against defendant. sorry i did not bring this to your attention y a . . . moral decision on the defendant. you are simply making a factual decision as to whether or not something happened. so if [the prosecutor] presents evidence and per ifor, know, . . . before coming into jury service, my family kind of shook me up a little bit in response, the court repeatedly probed the strength of want to make sure that we have 12 jurors who could be fair, [and] perform [their] duties. 7 [] affirmed that he did. the court asked again whether juror no. 7 could perform his duties and, again, juror no. 7 stated that he could. in a sidebar discussion with both counsel, the court stated that it was troubled by juror no. 7 on based on his moral issues, that he cannot judge people. so yesterday when i asked him initially he said he would be able to do his duties, then he writes a note that says he etty important for a juror to indicate whether or not they would be able to perform their separate stories. . . . [h]e told the court yesterday that he had no probleany of these issues, and this morning he sends a note indicating that he cannot perform his duties because he has got moral issues and that then, after lunch he changes his mind and he says that, basically, he has been pressured by the family. now he can, in fact, do it. [] . . . [h]e basically told the court three separate positions on two consecutive days, [and] two positions in one day. so, based on that, . . . be a fair [and] impartial juror because he has not told the court an ho found good i will find cause. he clearly has told the court three separate answers within two days. and we just took way too much time to make sure that we have 12 jurors and two alternates who could be fair and impartial. and based t think he on appeal, bryant argues that the dismissal of juror no. 7 was improper because as discussed below, we disagree. 8 a. standard of review [citations.] an impartial jury is one in which no member has been improperly influenced [citations] ecide the case solely on the evidence before it. (in re hamilton (1999) 20 cal.4th 273, 293294.) before or after the final submission of the case to the jury, a juror dies or becomes ill, or upon other good cause shown to the court is found to be unable to perform his or her duty, . . . the court may order the juror to be discharged . . . . ( 1089; see people v. farnam (2002) 28 cal.4th 107, 140the discretion of the triapeople v. taylor (1961) 189 cal.app.2d 490, 495; people v. manriquez (1976) 59 cal.app.3d 426, 431.) 1. typical abuse of discretion standard for reviewing a methods in determining whether to excuse a juror put on notice that good cause to discharge a juror may exist, people v. cunningham (2001) 25 cal.4th 926, 1029.) because a court confronted with possible grounds for dismissal must thread the invasivebroad discretionmanner in which [it] conduct (people v. fuiava (2012) 53 cal.4th 622, 710, 712 (fuiava); people v. clark (2011) 52 cal.4th 856, 971.) for example, the trial court need not engage in prolonged questioning of the juror who is at issue. as explained by fuiava, supra, 53 cal.4th 622we reject the notion that a trial court, having received an admission of disabling bias from a juror, is always required to attempt, in essence, to rehabilitate that juror by further exploring what the juror really meant. we have recognizedin the context of the evaluation of prospective jurors during voir direthat a trial court has the disqualification is so clear that further voir dire is pointless . . .

(id. at p. 714, italics added.4ven when there is conflicting evidence of juror bias, an appellate court must recognize that it is for the trial weigh the credibility of those testifying and draw upon its own observations of the jurors throughout the proceedings, and the reviewing court must defer to factual determinations based on these assessments (ibid., italics added.) accordingly, the assessment of equivocal or conflicting statements by a juror is usually left to the trial court. (see people v. lynch (2010) 50 cal.4th 693, 738745, abrogated on other grounds by people v. mckinnon (2011) 52 cal.4th 610, 636643 [affirming dismissal of juror due to equivocal statements and conduct].) s professed willingness to serve impartially can be overcome by behavior and demeanor noted by the trial court. (see people v. zamudio (2008) 43 cal.4th 327, 349; people v. lucas (1995) 12 cal.4th 415, 489.) such intangibles are to be accounted in favor of s decision: st position to s state of mind, . . . her demeanor, her vocal inflection and other nonverbal cues. and the answer [she] gave do not by themselves compel [exclusion] . . . , the need to defer to the trial court remains because so much may turn on . . .

(u.s. const., 6th amend.; cal. const., art. i,  15.) in y of a witness with evidence of the subdivision (f), of the california constitution, in pertinent part, provides as follows: in any criminal proceeding . . . shall subsequently be used without limitation for purposes of impeachment . . . in any criminal people v. jacobs (2000) 78 cal.app.4th 1444, 1452.) even if this right were not enshrined in the state constitution, california courts have held that when two different provisions of the evidence code (12025 & 7886) are considered together, they authorize a defendant (or any other party) to attack the 5 evidence code section 1202evidence of a statement or other conduct by a declarant that is inconsistent with a statement by such declarant received in evidence as hearsay evidence is not inadmissible for the purpose of attacking the credibility of the declarant though he is not given and has not had an opportunity to explain or to deny such inconsistent statement or other conduct. any other evidence offered to attack or support the credibility of the declarant is admissible if it would have been admissible had the declarant been a witness at the hearing. . . . 6 purpose of attacking the credibility of a witness, it may be shown by the examination of the witness or by the record of the judgment that he has been convicted of a felony . . . . 13 , provided those convictions show . (see, e.g., people v. jacobs, supra, 78 cal.app.4th at pp. 1446, 1449; people v. little (2012) 206 cal.app.4th 1364, 13751376; people v. castro (1985) 38 cal.3d 301, 313317.) operator and to one of the responding police officers. accordingly, bryant was entitled under evidence code sections 1201 and 788, and under article 1, section 28, subdivision (f), of the california constitution, to impeach her credibility with evidence of her prior felony convictions involving moral turpitude. as a result, the trial court refusal to allow bryant to do so was an error. b. the error did not violate the confrontation clause the united states supreme court has held that a criminal defendant states a violation of the confrontation clause by showing that he was prohibited from engaging in otherwise appropriate cross-examination designed to show a prototypical form of bias the jury the facts from which jurors . . . (delaware v. van arsdall (1986) 475 u.s. 673, 680.) however, as our supreme court has held that the confrontation clause is concerned solely with hearsay statements that are testimonial, in that they are out-of-court analogs, in purpose and form, of the testimony given by witnesses at trial.people v. cage (2007) 40 cal.4th 965, 984, italics added.) here, because the hearsay statements reports to the 911 operator and to the responding police officers, they were nontestimonial in naturethat made in the course of police interrogation under circumstances objectively indicating that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency.people v. cage, supra, 40 cal.4th at p. 982; see people v. brenn (2007) 152 cal.app.4th 166, 176177 [statements to 911 operator & responding police nontestimonial]; people v. banos (2009) 178 cal.app.4th 483, 492493, 499 [statements to 911 operator nontestimonial]; people v. byron (2009) 170 cal.app.4th 14 657, 661662, 675 [same]; see generally davis v. washington (2006) 547 u.s. 813, 822, 827; crawford v. washington (2004) 541 u.s. 36, 59, 68.) because the error did not implicate the confrontation clause, it is not subject to the harmless error analysis under chapman v. california (1967) 386 u.s. 18, 24that is, the har standard. instead, it is subject to analysis under people v. watson (1956) 46 cal.2d 818, 836that is, a defendant must demonstrate that is reasonably probable that a result more favorable to [the defendant] would hav (see people v. cudjo (1993) 6 cal.4th 585, 611612 [applying watson standard to erroneous exclusion of defense evidence].) reasonable probabilitydoes not mean more likely than not, but merely a reasonable chance, more than an abstract possibility. (college hospital inc. v. superior court (1994) 8 cal.4th 704, 715.) reasonable probability people v. bolin (1998) 18 cal.4th 297, 333.) c. the exclusion of williamss prior felony convictions was not harmless after considering all of the evidence, we hold that it is reasonably probable that bryant would have achieved a more favorable result if the trial court had allowed him to following factors. first, williams was not merely one of many prosecution witness; she was the owever, never got a chance to see and evaluate her credibility, never had the opportunity to assess her demeanor and the veracity of her varying descriptions of the events at issue, because williams never testified at trial. second, while there was other evidence contradicting hearsay statements on material points, namely her own testimony at the preliminary hearing, the jury could have received a significantly different impression of credibility had 15 bryant been permitted to pursue his proposed line of impeachment. as it was, the jury s in a historical vacuum. third, because williams did not testify at trial, no live, in court cross-examination was possible; as a result, the only cross-examination that could occur was through impeachment via the introduction of other evidence, such as the preliminary hearing transcript. under such constrained circumstances, it would have been appropriate to allow as much impeachment evidence as was both practical and appropriate. critically, other than its mistaken belief about the admissibility of the convictions, the trial court never stated (and the record does not suggest) rior felony convictions would have been inadmissible under evidence code section 352that is, there is no indication that prior felony convictions would have been dmission [would] (a) necessitate undue consumption of time or (b) create substantial danger of given that the issue of prior felony convictions was limited to just one witness, there was no danger of the trial degenerating into [a] nitpicking war[] (people v. wheeler (1992) 4 cal.4th 284, 296.) finally there were no third party eyewitnesses to the altercation between bryant and williams; there was only their contending (and, in the case of williams, changing) versions of events. the people attempted to make up for the lack of other eyewitnesses by introducing, inter alia, domestic violence. even though alleged conduct in a larger historical context, and bryant was not able to do the same for williams due to the exclusion of the prior felony convictions, the jury did not return an especially quick verdict. the jury began its deliberations at 10:47 a.m. on friday, february 27, 2015. the jury deliberated through the end of the day without reaching a verdict. the jury resumed its deliberations on monday, march 2. the jury did not reach its verdict until just a few minutes before noon on march 2. the fact that the jury was forced to deliberate for approximately eight hours 16 over the course of two days suggests that the verdict was anything but a foregone conclusion, making the exclusion of the prior felony convictions potentially quite significant. this case was, in large part, a he said, she said controversy, making the credibility of the accused and his accuser of central, if not critical, importance to the jury. because 911 tapeher testimony at the preliminary hearing was read to the jurorsand because the jury apparently did not consider the case to be an open and shut, slam dunk, it is reasonably probable that bryant would have achieved a more favorable result if the trial court had allowed him to introduce evidharmless. disposition the judgment is reversed. not to be published. johnson, j. we concur: rothschild, p. j. lui, j
