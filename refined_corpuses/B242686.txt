addition to the burglaries, it was alleged that maris had suffered prior convictions for which he served prison terms pursuant to section 667.5, subdivision (b), one for addiction to a narcotic or possession of a firearm in violation of former section 12021, subdivision (a)(1) and one for assault with a firearm ( 245, subd.

(a)(2)) and one for robbery ( 211). at proceedings held on october 4, 2011, counsel for maris made a motion to argued that it was not realistic to think that, immediately after committing the burglary of is quite compelling, at least for after the case alleging the two burglaries was filed, a second matter, case no. na089308, was brought against maris. this information, also filed on august 1, 2011, alleged a burglary and an assault by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury. in addition, the same additional allegations of prior convictions and prison terms 7 had been charged. on october 4, 2011, the prosecutor made a motion to have the two re is a strong preference for joint trials on similar charges. identical penal code sections are involved -the counts are triable. there is not one which i would say is so substantially stronger or january 18, 2012, an amended information was filed which charged, in addition to the two burglaries, a third first degree residential burglary with a person present ( 459) (count 3) and an assault by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury ( 245, subd. (a)(1)) (count 4). the information also alleged all of the allegations of previous convictions and prison terms which had been charged in the august 1, 2011 informations. maris had retained counsel to defend him with regard to counts 1 and 2. after the amended information was filed, the trial court appointed retained counsel to defend maris with regard to counts 3 aon your own status, whatever that was, between you and mr. maris on 1 and 2, that at proceedings held on may 5, 2012, the people offered maris a sentence of 26 years in prison if he entered pleas of guilty or no contest to count 1 (first degree residential burglary with a person present in violation of section 459) and count 4 (assault by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury in violation of section 245, subdivision (a)(1)) and admitted that he had suffered a conviction for a serious or violent felony, residential burglary, in violation of section 459, for purposes of the three strikes law ( 667, subds. (b)-(i), 1170.12, subds. (a)-(d)); that he had suffered two prior convictions for serious felonies, one for residential burglary ( 459) and one for robbery ( 211), pursuant to section 667, subdivision (a)(1); and that he had served two prison for being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of former section 12021, 8 subdivision (a)(1), pursuant to section 667.5, subdivision (b). defense counsel then inquired of the trial court if it would, on an open plea, impose 26 years although maris sentence of 75 years years in prison. maris waived his right to a jury trial, his right to confront and cross-examine the witnesses against him, his right to present a defense and to use the subpoena power of the court to bring before it evidence and witnesses and his privilege against self-incrimination. he then pled no contest to count 1, first degree burglary with a person present and count 4, assault by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury, and admitted suffering the alleged prior convictions and prison terms, including the allegation . the trial court to a jury trial, confrontation, cross-examination, his privilege against self-incrimination, his right to the free subpoena power of the court, and [that] the pleas and admissions were made knowing[] . . . the consequences[.] [accordingly,] the court accept[ed] them and and allegations in [the] case . . . pursuan sentencing proceedings were held on may 30, 2012. the trial court denied -- pursuant to the agreement, the trial court denied probation with regard to counts 1 and 4. the court then, with regard to count 1, sentenced maris to state prison for six years, doubled to 12 years pursuant to the 9 22 years. with regard to count 4, the court imposed one-third the mid-term of one year, then doubled the term for a total of two additional years. finally, for each of the two section 667.5, subdivision (b) prison terms, the trial court imposed one year. in total, maris was sentenced to 26 years in state prison. he was awarded presentence custody credits for 397 days actually served and 59 days of conduct credit, for a total of 456 days. the trial court ordered maris to pay a $30 criminal conviction assessment (gov. code,  70373), a $40 court security fee ( 1465.8, subd. (a)(1)), a $240 restitution fine ( 1202.4, subd. (b)), and a $240 suspended parole revocation restitution fine ( 1202.45). on july 17, 2012, maris filed a timely notice of appeal and request for a certificate of probable cause. in his request for a certificate of probable cause, maris indicated that he deserved a life sentence. in addition, he asserted his trial counsel was incompetent for failing to investigate his claim that two of his prior convictions were invalid; counsel failed to contact the experts who could have shown the priors were improper. finally, maris argued he was never advised that, once he entered the no contest plea, he could neither withdraw it nor attack it collaterally. the triacertificate of probable cause on july 19, 2012. contentions after examination of the record, counsel filed an opening brief which raised no issues and requested this court to conduct an independent review of the record. by notice filed october 18, 2012, the clerk of this court advised maris to submit within 30 days any contentions, grounds of appeal or arguments he wished this court to consider. in a letter filed november 8, 2012, maris indicated he believed that the in their commission, or different statements of the same offense or two or more different offenses of the same class of crimes or offenses, under separate counts, and if two or 10 more accusatory pleadings are filed in such cases in the same court, the court may order en determining whether to consolidate cases are the cross-admissibility of evidence, whether one of the ejudicial. (see belton v. superior court (1993) 19 cal.app.4th 1279, 1284.) here, maris argues the cases occurred almost a year apart and that the time factor, itself, would cause him to be prejudiced by their consolidation. the contention is without merit. although they occurred several months apart, both cases involved the burglary, with a person present, of apartments in the same area. after maris entered the apartments and confronted the occupants, he left. in addition, although he attacked the occupant of one apartment but id. potential for substantial prejudice outweighs the well-recognized benefits to the state id. at p. 1288.) the trial court properly exercised its discretion when it consolidated the two cases. (ibid.) in a second letter, filed november 9, 2012, maris claimed he should have been charged with section 460, which indicates the difference between first and second degree burglary. section 459 simply refers to burglary in general. he urged citation to one statute alone was not enough to allege an offense and thus, by pleading to only section 459, he could not be held liable for the commission of first degree residential burglary. people v. scofield (1983) 149 cal.app.3d 368, 371, the court determined that, reading sections 459, 460 and 461 togethsection 459 defines the elements of the crime, section 460 divides the crime into two levels of seriousness for the purpose of sentencing, and section 461 sets out the sentence terms. the aggravating factors used to establish the degree of an offense are not the 11 review on appeal we have examined the entire record and are satisfied counsel has complied fully smith v. robbins (2000) 528 u.s. 259, 278-284; people v. wende (1979) 25 cal.3d 436, 443.) disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports aldrich, j. we concur: klein, p. j. croskey, j.
