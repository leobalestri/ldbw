(a)).1 the jury acquitted appellant of a second count of the same offense. appellant admitted a prior conviction and the court sentenced him to two years in state prison comprised of one year (one-third of the middle term of three years) doubled to two years for the prior strike conviction. the sentence was to be served consecutively to the sentence he was already serving. * boren, p. j., doi todd, j., ashmann-gerst, j. 1 all further statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise stated. 2 background a. factual background on may 20, 2010, around 8:00 p.m. los angeles county deputy sheriffs adam nelson and ryan ortiz who were assigned to operation safe jails conducted cell searches at the twin towers correctional facility. appellant was assigned the upper bunk of cell number 4 in c pod and was on it when the deputies came to the cell. appellant and his cellmate were escorted out of the cell and taken to the recreational area. deputies nelson the top bunk over and saw a slit in the middle of the mattress. he reached inside the mattress and recovered a piece of metal approximately seven inches long with one end sharpened to a point. both deputies testified to substantial training and experience with respect to recovering weapons from inmates, and each opined that based on this training inflicting harm. on december 6, 2010, los angeles county deputy sheriff nelson tario was assigned to lockup at the criminal courts building.2 his duties included monitoring the flow of inmates in and out of the building and searching the inmates for weapons. at approximately 7:40 a.m. appellant arrived by bus at the service level of the building. he was carrying a bag and deputy tario asked him to place the bag on a chair and empty his pockets. -inch-long pencil that had been cut in half lengthwise and tied together with string was 2 there was a stipulation that on december 6, 2010, appellant was a pro. per. inmate. 3 found a razor blade inside an envelope that belonged opinion that the razor blade could be inserted in the split pencil and used as a weapon. on october 15, 2005, at around 1:00 p.m., donald nall, a correctional officer at sierra conservation center conducted a search of appellant in the medical department of pen had a screw protruding through the cap of the pen. based on his experience working at the prison officer nall opined that the pen was a stabbing weapon. appellant offered the testimony of richard lichten, a retired lieutenant with the inmate culture and police practices, and was familiar with jail-made weapons. he opined that the pencil found on appellant was altered to function as a mechanical pencil, so that the lead would advance without having to sharpen the pencil. lichten described the item opined that it was used for stabbing and slashing. b. procedural background appellant was charged with one count of possession of a weapon in a penal institution related to the may 20, 2010 incident. the court granmotion to consolidate that case with the count involving the incident on december 6, 2010. appellant filed a pitchess3 motion which was denied without prejudice. a second pitchess motion was granted. a motion to sever the previously consolidated cases was denied. after deliberation, the jury convicted appellant on count 1, and acquitted him on romero4 motion and motion for new trial. appellant admitted a prior conviction for carjacking ( 215) and was sentenced to a two-year consecutive sentence in state prison. this appeal followed. 3 pitchess v. superior court (1974) 11 cal.3d 531 (pitchess). 4 people v. superior court (romero) (1996) 13 cal.4th 497. 4 discussion we appointed counsel to represent appellant on appeal. after examining the record, counsel filed an opening brief pursuant to people v. wende (1979) 25 cal.3d 436 (wende), raising no issues, but requesting a review of the record including the in camera pitchess review. we gave notice to appellant that his appointed counsel had not found any arguable issues, and that he had 30 days within which to submit by brief or letter any grounds of appeal, contentions, or arguments he wanted this court to consider. appellant submitted an eight-page letter contending that he received ineffective assistance of counsel and the court erred in consolidating the two cases; denying his request for a continuance; denying his request to represent himself; and in imposing a consecutive sentence. i. consolidation a result of a combination of the judicially recognized manriquez 5 and that a trial court may order consolidation for trial of two or more accusatory pleadings people v. soper (2009) 45 cal.4th 759, 771.) offenses are of the same class of crimes or offenses if they have common characteristics or attributes. (people v. moore (1986) 185 cal.app.3d 1005, 1012.) offenses are connected in their commission if there is a common element of substantial importance in their commission, including the intent or motivation with which different acts are committed. (alcala v. superior court (2008) 43 cal.4th 1205, 1210, 12161217.) the law prefers consolidation of charges based on 5 people v. manriquez (2005) 37 cal.4th 547. 5 important policy considerations, including conservation of judicial resources and public funds. (people v. manriquez, supra, 37 cal.4th at p. 574.) here, the class of the two charged offenses was the same (i.e.,  4502, subd. (a), custodial possession of a weapon). the two cases were connected in that appellant was the alleged offender in both. in each, appellant allegedly concealed a weapon capable of inflicting harm on others. the two cases occurred within seven months of each other and although the alleged offenses were committed at two different custodial locations and involved diffewere satisfied. where the statutory requirements for joinder are met, the defendant must make a clear showing of prejudice to demonstrate that the trial court abused its discretion. (people v. zambrano (2007) 41 cal.4th 1082, 11281129, disapproved on other grounds in people v. doolin (2009) 45 cal.4th 390, 421, fn. 22.) improper consolidation violates due process only if it results in a trial that is fundamentally unfair. (park v. california (9th cir. 2000) 202 f.3d 1146, 1149.) error involving misjoinder affects substantial rights and requires reversal if it results in actual prejudice because it had substantial and (united states v. lane (1986) 474 u.s. 438, 449.) the burden is on the defendant to demonstrate a reasonable probability that the people v. grant (2003) 113 cal.app.4th 579, 588.) the factors to be considered include: (1) cross-admissibility of the evidence; (2) whether some charges are likely to unusually inflame the jury against the defendant; (3) whether a weak case has been joined with a strong case, or with another weak case, so that the spillover effect of aggregate evidence on several charges might well alter the outcome of some or all of the charges; and (4) whether one of the charges is a capital offense or the joinder of charges converts the matter into a capital case. (people v. carter (2005) 36 cal.4th 1114, 1154.) as the fourth factor is clearly inapplicable, we limit the discussion to the first three factors. for reasons discussed below, we conclude appellant has failed to meet his burden of showing prejudice. 6 while the bulk of the evidence at trial was not cross-admissible for both crimes charged, the court did allow evidence of a third shank case to be used in both cases (evid. code,  1101, subd. (b)). in any event, absence of cross-admissibility of evidence does not, by itself, demonstrate prejudice when consolidation of charges is ordered. (people v. soper, supra, 45 cal.4th at pp. 779780.) next, because the charges were identical in each case, neither charged offense deration of the other. nor the other. the people first presented evidence on the december 6, 2010 incident and then presented evidence on the may 20, 2010 incident. this enabled the jury to consider case to the other. (see, e.g., people v. rogers (2006) 39 cal.4th 826, 854.) hey had to convict on joinder are not outweighedand severance is not requiredmerely because properly joined charges might make it more difficult for a defendant to avoid conviction compared people v. soper, supra, joinder strong evidence of a lesser but inflammatory crime might be used to bolster a weak prosecution people v. mason (1991) 52 cal.3d 909, 934.) bjoinder of cases, we find no abuse of discretion in granting thconsolidate the cases. ii. ineffective assistance of counsel appellant contends that his counsel invited the jury to convict on count 1, and that this invitation amounted to ineffective assistance of counsel. 7 in order to establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, appellant must (strickland v. washington (1984) 466 u.s. 668, 687688, 694; people v. ledesma (1987) 43 cal.3d 171, 216218.) claim of ineffective assistance of counsel (see people v. wright (1990) 52 cal.3d 367, people v. lucas (1995) 12 cal.4th 415, 436437, quoting strickland v. washington, supra, 466 u.s. at p. 689.) people v. frye (1998) 18 cal.4th 894, -guess reasonable, if difficult, people v. scott (1997) 15 cal.4th 1188, people v. bolin (1998) 18 cal.4th 297, 333.) count 1 at least involved a both counts and particularly on count 1 where the weapon was discovered inside have hidden the weapon. the jury could have found that explanation sufficient to acquit appellant on count 1, acknowledgement that 8 reasonable to infer that the jury acquitted appellant on count 2 because they found furthermore the jury was instructed to decide the case on the evidence presented and that remarks made by the attorneys in opening statements and closing arguments were not evidence. jurors (people v. holt (1997) 15 cal.4th 619, 662.) ot identify these individuals or how they would have assisted the defense, and does not provide any argument or support for this contention. we cannot consider mere contentions of error unaccompanied by legal argument, since they have not been properly raised. (people v. williams (1997) 16 cal.4th 153, 206.) counsel secured an acquittal on count 2, and we see no reasonable probability that appellant would have received a more favorable outcome in regards to count 1, in light of the compelling evidence of guilt. (people v. ledesma, supra, 43 cal.3d at pp. 216218.) iii. denial of motion for continuance appellant contends the trial court abused its discretion by denying his request for a continuance filed on november 9, 2011. appellant is mistaken. the trial was scheduled to begin november 22, 2011. iv. pro. per. status [sic] of his faretta 6 6 faretta v. california (1975) 422 u.s. 806. 9 people v. williams, supra, 16 cal.4th at p. 206.) we need not consider on appeal mere contentions of error unaccompanied by legal argument. (people v. earp (1999) 20 cal.4th 826, 884.) in the interest of judicial economy we address the issue and find that appellant voluntarily waived his right to self representation. on may 12, 2011, at the hearing on the motion to consolidate, appellant appeared in pro. per. on case no. ba371834 (may no. ba379936 (december 6, 2010 incident). the trial court granted the motion to where he was forcnot to go pro. per. and exercise my faretta decision.desirous of that status. so, [public defender], you have both cases. all right. so the the deferential abuse of discretion standard of review applies to a claim that the trial court erred in ruling on a motion to abandon the right of self-representation. (people v. lawrence (2009) 46 cal.4th 186, 191192.) reviewing the totality of circumstances, was not coerced or involuntary. the record is clear that appellant knew and understood both his right to counsel and his right to self-representation and had long asserted his right to self-representation in the prior filings. he was knowledgeable on the law as demonstrated by the numerous discovery and continuance motions he persistently asserted. a fair reading of the colloquy between appellant and the trial court belies any 10 appointment of counsel for the consolidated case was voluntary. that determination was well within the reasonable discretion of the trial court. v. sentencing issue appellant contends that the trial court erred by sentencing him to a consecutive without merit. pursuant to section 1170.1, subdivision (a), when consecutive terms of principal term, the subordinate term, and any additional term imposed for applicable enhancements . . . consecutive offense shall consist of one-third of the middle term of imprisonment prescribed . . . (ibid.) the sentencing rules apply to consecutive sentences regardless of whether the sentences were imposed in the same proceeding or court, or in different ones. (ibid.) who, while at or confined in any penal institution, while being conveyed to or from any penal institution, or while under the custody of officials, officers, or employees of any penal institution, possesses or carries upon his or her person or has under his or her custody or control . . . any dirk or dagger or sharp instrument, . . . is guilty of a felony and shall be punished by imprisonment . . . on july 8, 2009, at approximately 8:05 p.m., appellant brandished a pair of scissors and threatened the manager of a restaurant before he fled with approximately $150. earlier in the day at a bank of america branch in los angeles he simulated possession of a handgun and threatened to shoot a bank patron if the teller did not comply with his demands. the teller placed $1,595 on the counter which appellant grabbed and left the bank. approximately one week later, app 11 while she was present. he was arrested and positively identified by the victim. appellant threatened the victim and the arresting officers.7 appellant was charged with robbery ( 211) in case no. ba359098 (robbery case). while appellant was in custody on the robbery case and prior to his plea, los angeles county deputy sheriffs adam 2010, at the twin towers correctional facility. appellant was charged with possession of a weapon in a penal institution ( 4502, subd. (a)) in case no. ba371834 (weapons case). by plea in the robbery case and he was sentenced to 19 years in state prison. on december 7, 2011, appellant was convicted in the weapons case. s with the plain meaning of section 4502 and would lead to absurd results. a defendant could avoid harsher punishment despite admitted or proven recidivist conduct by delaying the pronouncement of judgment until after he or she commits additional serious or violent felonies. (cf. people v. johnson (1989) 210 cal.app.3d 316.) pursuant to section 1170.1, subdivision (a), the principal term here is 19 years for robbery in case no. ba359098. section 4502 clearly and unequivocally requires consecutive sentencing, but does not mandate full consecutive sentences. (people v. mosley (2007) 155 cal.app.4th 313, 328.) the court correctly selected a subordinate term of one-third of the middle term of three years (doubled because of the prior strike) to 7 this information was obtained from the probation report of june 10, 2010, which is part of the record. 12 appointed counsel requested that we independently review the sealed transcript of pitchess motion, which we have done. the trial to permit appellate review of its ruling. (people v. mooc (2001) 26 cal.4th 1216, 1229, in camera hearing. the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports.
