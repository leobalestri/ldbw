(people v. akhile (2008) 167 cal.app.4th 558, 562-563.) iii. proceedings below prosecutor, at the behest of the court, warned appellant of the immigration consequences cause you to deported [sichearing on his motion to vacate his conviction, appellant argued that the court failed to advise him of all three categories of the immigration consequences of his plea. in denyis necessary under people v. gutierrez [(2003) 106 cal.app.4th 169]; and under people v. gutierrez i find substantial compliance. there is absolutely no evidence that the defendant did not receive the information he needed from his counsel or did not know it. 4 there is no declaration from the defendant. there is no statement by him under oath. denied on that certificate of probable cause. iv. abuse of discretion; prejudice finding required missed due to his failure to obtain a certificate of probable cause. respondent quotes at length from people v. placencia (2011) 194 cal.app.4th 489 (placencia), where the court held that a certificate is required in order to appeal from a denial of a section 1016.5 motion and dismissed the appeal. (placencia, at pp. 494-495.) the issue of whether a defendant must obtain a certificate of probable cause in order to appeal from a section 1016.5 motion is currently pending before the california supreme court in a case from this court, people v. arriaga (2011) 201 cal.app.4th 429 (arriaga), review granted february 22, 2012, s199339. the majority opinion in arriaga disagreed with placencia and found no probable cause certificate was required. assuming the certificate is not it is true that the exact language of the advisement is not crucial, as long as the advisement is complete; i.e., as long as it advises the defendant of all three of the possible immigration-related consequences he might suffer. (people v. superior court (zamudio) (2000) 23 cal.4th 183, 207-208 (zamudio); people v. gutierrez, supra, 106 cal.app.4th at p. 174 (gutierrezrececase is like zamudio, where the advisement was lacking only the mention of the possibility of exclusion. the zamudio court noted that this may have been the most serious consequence for the defendant, and perhaps the only one that might have weighed against entering a no-contest plea, since deportation does not necessarily preclude legal reentry. (zamudio, at pp. 206-207, 208.) we therefore conclude that the trial court gutierrez. 5 in the exact language of the statute. (gutierrez, at p. 173.) gutierrez held that such a variance from the literal language of the statute did not require the plea to be vacated. (id. at pp. 173-all of the exclusion consequence. in order to prevail on his motion, however, appellant must show more than the fact the motion, more than a remote possibility that the conviction will have one or more of people v. totari (2002) 28 cal.4th 876, 884 (totari).) with respect to show that it is reasonably probable he would not id. at p. 884.) that his legal permanent residence status will be terminated. indeed, the denial of reentry, appellant attempted to reenter this country with his permanent resident card after a recent visit abroad, he was stopped at the airport. therefore, this element has been satisfied. ents is a factual question, appropriate for decision by the trial zamudio, supra, 23 cal.4th at p. 210.) the court below needed from his counsel or did not know it. there is no declaration from the defendant. however, a sworn declaration from appellant that, had he been aware of the consequences of the plea, he would not have entered into the plea. 6 having concluded that appellant was not advised as required by section 1016.5 and that there is more than a remote possibility he will suffer adverse immigration consequences, we remand the matter to the trial court to determine whether appellant suffered prejudice; that is, if appellant has made a sufficient showing that it is totari, supra, 28 cal.4th at p. 884; see also zamudio, supra, 23 cal.4th at p. 210.) whether a defendant knew of all of the potential immigration consequences, despite inadequate advisements at the time of the plea, may be a significant factor in determining prejudice.2 (zamudio, at pp. 199, 207, 209-210.) appellant need not demonstrate the likelihood he would have obtained a more favorable result at trial. (people v. castro-vasquez (2007) 148 cal.app.4th 1240, 1245-1246.) disposition the order appealed from is reversed and the matter is remanded to the trial court with directions to determine whether appellant was prejudiced by the incomplete advisement under section 1016.5. not to be published in the official reports. boren, p.j. we concur: doi todd, j. chavez, j. 2 we note that appellant did not receive the benefit of a plea bargain and entered into an open plea to the court. his attorney in 1993, marie girolamo, refused to join in the when contacted by immigration authorities after he had served his sentence. he states , he would be given more time in prison. he then agreed to leave the country voluntarily. we also note that appellant later reentered the country without being detained or denied reentry, and he was granted permanent resident status.
