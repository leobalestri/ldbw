during the afternoon on march 29, 2013, los angeles police department detective erbie phillips monitored the activity at a single family house at 1268 east 49th street in preparation for the service of a search warrant. he was looking for pedestrian activity that would indicate narcotic activity. during a 50-minute period, the detective saw three or four people approach the residence on foot and walk down the driveway to the backyard. after a couple of minutes, those people walked out of the backyard, up the driveway, and away from the residence. detective phillips believed the people had purchased drugs. a police informant was given two $5 bills and sent to the location to attempt to an off-white solid that appeared to be cocaine base. at some point, other police officers arrived to serve the search warrant. they knocked on the back door. michael berry opened the door. no other persons were inside the house. the police searched the house. in the living room, they found two bindles of an off-white substance that appeared to be cocaine base, two baggies that contained a white substance that appeared to be cocaine, a rifle, two revolvers, and $128 consisting of one $20 bill, two $10 bills, 14 $5 bills, and 18 $1 bills. the cash included the two $5 bills the police had given the informant to purchase drugs. in one of the bedrooms, the police found a baggie of a

were possessed for sale based on the amount and packaging of the drugs and the fact that there were loaded firearms in close proximity to the drugs. he further opined that the cocaine was possessed for personal use based on the amount of cocaine. according to officer soto, most drug users purchase drugs with bills of small denominationsi.e., $1, $5, and $10. he testified if a person was arrested a home with narcotics and possessed a large number of $1 bills, the $1 bills were the revenue from narcotics sales. officer soto testified that drug dealers do which they sell drugs. drug dealers commonly are robbed, and so want to protect their merchandise by controlling those with relative would be a factor in gaining access. a los angeles police department criminalist analyzed the substances recovered in connection with the search warrant served at 1268 east 49th street. the substances tested positive for cocaine base, cocaine, methamphetamine, and phencyclidine. the parties stipulated that defendant had been convicted of a felony prior to the date of the alleged offenses in this case. 2 officer soto testified that the $75 consisted of one $20 bill, one $10, and 35 $1 bills. we note those bills total $65 and not $75. 6 discussion i. sufficiency of the evidence the jury convicted defendant of five drug possession offensespossession for sale of cocaine base, possession a controlled substance (cocaine), possession for sale of a controlled substance (methamphetamine), and two counts of possession for sale of phencyclidine. without specifying the conviction or convictions to which his argument then, defendant cites several cases in which appellate courts have held that evidence was insufficient to support a drug possession offense but does not explain how we as applying to each of his drug possession convictions and as asserting the argument that there is insufficient evidence that he possessed the drugs at issue. sufficient evidence supports the convictions. a. standard of review evidence to support a conviction, we review the entire record in the light most favorable to the judgment to determine whether it contains substantial evidencethat is, evidence that is reasonable, credible, and of solid valuefrom which a reasonable trier of fact could find the (people v. lindberg (2008) 45 cal.4th 1, 27 [82 cal.rptr.3d 323, 190 p.3d 664].) evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could (jackson v. virginia (1979) 443 u.s. 307, 319 [61 l.ed.2d 560, 99 s.ct. 2781].) in so doing, a existence of every fact the trier (people v. kraft (2000) 23 cal.4th 978, (people v. edwards (2013) 57 cal.4th 658, 715.) insufficient evidence s 7 verdict. (people v. zamudio (2008) 43 cal.4th 327, 357.) evidence includes circumstantial evidence and the reasonable inferences flowing (people v. ugalino (2009) 174 cal.app.4th 1060, 1064.) logical inferences that the jury might have drawn from the circumstantial evidence. (people v. zamudio, supra, 43 cal.4th at pp. 357-358.) in evidence, resolve conflicts in the evidence, draw inferences contrary to the verdict, or (people v. little (2004) 115 cal.app.4th 766, 771, citing people v. jones (1990) 51 cal.3d 294, 314.) b. application of relevant principles elements of possession of narcotics are physical or constructive possession thereof coupled with knowledge of the presence and narcotic character of the drug. [citations.] constructive possession occurs when the accused maintains control or a right to control the contraband; possession may be imputed when the contraband is found in a place which is immediately and exclusively accessible to the accused and subject to his dominion and control, or to the joint dominion and control of the accused and another. [citation.] the elements of unlawful possession may be established by circumstantial evidence and any reaso (people v. newman (1971) 5 cal.3d 48, 52, disapproved on another ground by people v. daniels (1975) 14 cal.3d 857, 862.)3 3 there are two kinds of possession: actual possession and constructive possession. actual possession requires that a person knowingly exercise direct physical control over a thing. constructive possession does not require actual possession but does require that a person knowingly exercise control over or the right to control a thing, either directly or through another person or persons. one person may have possession alone, or two or more persons together may share actual or constructive possession. 8 will not, without more, support a finding of unlawful possession. [citation.] but the necessary elements (that the accused exercised dominion and control over the drug with knowledge of both its presence and its narcotic character) may be established by circumstantial evidence and any reasonable inferences drawn from such evidence; and neither exclusive possession of the premises nor physical possession of the drug is required. (people v. harrington (1970) 2 cal.3d 991, 998 superseded on other grounds as stated in people v. coffman (2004) 34 cal.4th 1, 116-117.) 1. the january 12, 2013, incident (count 20) the evidence adduced in support of count 20 is finding that defendant possessed the phencyclidine found in the backyard refrigerator. defendant admitted to the police that he resided in the house at 5203 latham street. mail in his name at the 5203 latham street address was found in the residence. when they found 68 milliliters of phencyclidine, an amount officer soto testified was possessed for sale. the officers also found stacks of money in various places consisting of numerous bills in small denominations. officer ahn testified that he believed that the money was related to narcotics sales because cash in small denominations was necessary in the drug trade. defendant was found in possession of $705 in small billsi.e., the denominations used in narcotics sales. from such evidence, a juror reasonably could conclude that defendant was involved in the sale of phencyclidine, that he had dominion and control over the bottle in his backyard refrigerator that contained phencyclidine, that , that he knepossessed the phencyclidine. (people v. newman, supra, 5 cal.3d at p. 52.) 2. the march 29, 2013, incident (counts 1, 2, 3 and 5) the evidence adduced in support of counts 1, 2, 3, and 5 is sufficient to support and phencyclidine found in the house at 1268 east 49th street. the police believed that 9 drugs were being sold from the house and had the house under surveillance. a police informant purchased cocaine base from the house. the police searched the house and found indicia of drugs and drug sales. they found cocaine base, cocaine, methamphetamine, and phencyclidine. the police found a rifle and three handguns and a was the property, he was in possession of a pay-owe sheet. the police arrested defendant in the front yard after he exited the house. a search of defendant uncovered $368 in small billsdescription of the denominations used in narcotics sales. according to officer soto, if a bills, the $1 bills were the revenue from narcotics sales. he further testified that drug dealers do sell drugs because they commonly are robbed. the evidence adduced in connection with the january 12, 2013, incident established that defendant was a drug dealer. as with the january 12, 2013, incident, the home contained narcotics and small denominations of cash. from the evidence, a juror reasonably could conclude that defendant was involved with his brother and berry in the sale of cocaine base, methamphetamine, and phencyclidine from the house at 1268 east 49th street; that he had dominion and control over those drugs and the cocaine found in the house; ; that he knew of the ; and that he thus possessed the cocaine base, methamphetamine, phencyclidine, and cocaine. (people v. newman, supra, 5 cal.3d at p. 52.) ii. sentencing defendant was charged in count 2 of the amended information with possession for sale of a controlled substance (cocaine) in violation of section 11351. the amended information also alleged that in the commission of that offense, defendant was personally 10 armed with a firearm in violation of penal code section 12022, subdivision (c).4 the jury found defendant guilty on count 2 of the lesser included offense of possession of a controlled substance (cocaine) in violation of section 11350, subdivision (a). because a violation of section 11350, subdivision (a) is not an offense listed in penal code section 12022, subdivision (c), the verdict form properly did not give the jury an opportunity to make a finding under penal code section 12022, subdivision (c) with respect to the lesser included offense. at sentencing, however, the trial court imposed and stayed a four year 11350, subdivision (a) conviction. at the same time, the trial court struck the penal code section 12022, subdivision (c) allegation with respect to counts 3 and 5. we asked the parties to submit supplemental letter briefs addressing whether the trial court erred in sentencing defendant on count 2 and whether we should remand the matter for resentencing because the trial court may not have stricken the penal code section 12022, subdivision (c) allegations as to counts 3 and 5 if it knew it could not impose a penal code section 12022, subdivision (c) enhancement on count 2. defendant did not file a letter. we agree with the attorney general that the trial court erred in sentencing on count 2 and that the matter must be remanded for resentencing. accordingly, we esentencing. 4 notwithstanding the enhancement set forth in subdivision (a), a person who is personally armed with a firearm in the commission of a violation or attempted violation of section 11351, 11351.5, 11352, 11366.5, 11366.6, 11378, 11378.5, 11379, 11379.5, or 11379.6 of the health and safety code shall be punished by an additional and consecutive term of imprisonment pursuant to subdivision (h) of section 1170 for three, four, or five years. 11 disposition and the matter is remanded for resentencing. on remand, the trial court may impose a penal code section 12022, subdivision (c) enhancement on either count 3 or count 5. the judgment is otherwise affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. mosk, j. we concur: turner, p. j. kriegler, j.
