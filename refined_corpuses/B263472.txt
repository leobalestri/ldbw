(people v. homick (2012) 55 cal.4th 816, 869.) 3 the entire encounter lasted about a minute. although both the driver and passenger were wearing helmets, the helmets did not cover their eyes or noses, d robles estimated that he looked at the dri15 seconds and at the for approximately four to six seconds. he could not tell what race they were. robles said the driver was wearing a white shirt, blue jeans, and had on a black helmet. robles said the passenger was wearing a gray sweater and had on a black helmet; robles did not notice any writing on the sweater. after the motorcycle pulled away, robles continued to a and, once there, called 911. he reported the robbery and told the 911 operator that the passenger looked to be 12 or 13 years old based on his stature on the motorcycle. robles the police dispatcher broadcast a description of the motorcycle involved in the robbery, and a patrol car soon thereafter spotted a motorcycle matching that description. the officers in that car activated their lights and sirens. the driver then led them on a high-speed chase during which time the motorcycle jumped on and off various freeways, sped more than 90 miles per hour, ran red lights and signals, and crossed multiple lanes of traffic without looking. both officers were able to see that the driver was wearing a light-colored shirt, blue jeans, and unlike robles reported, a white helmet; they saw the passenger wearing a gray top and a black helmet. police helicopters assisted with the pursuit. the observer in the first helicopter saw the driver wearing a white shirt, blue pants, and like the officers but unlike robles reported, a white and a black 4 or dark-colored helmet. the observer in the second helicopter watched the motorcycle disappear under a freeway underpass and continue on with just the driver. thereafter, the observer saw the driver leave the motorcycle and disappear into a neighborhood on foot. within five to ten minutes of losing sight of the s, s iphone was pinging from a house on south concord street. the house was just 1.4 miles from the location of the robbery. on a walkway right outside the house, police discovered an abandoned motorcycle and helmet. less than 25 minutes later, several police officers entered the two-story house. the house was known to be inhabited by squatters, and police found seven menall in their late teens, 20s, and 30sinside. juarez was hiding beneath -space attic, next to a bandana filled with live .38-caliber rounds. he was wearing black shorts and a black shirt. sanchez was laying behind a couch on the first floor. he was wearing a gray sweatshirt with the on the chest. s pinging iphone in the second-floor bedroom; in the same bedroom, they recovered a pair of jeans and two shirts, one of which was a gray shirt with writing on the chest and left sleeve (in the same size as the gray sweatshi police also recovered a motorcycle helmet inside the house. the police transported robles in a police cruiser to a location two to three houses down from the house where they found his iphone. they told robles they had recovered his iphone and brought him down to look at who we caught . . . who police then marched juarez, sanchez, and at least to the street, one at a time, 5 for approximately 30 seconds. police did not ask any of those men to put on a helmet or to sit atop a motorcycle. robles identified juarez as the driver and sanchez as the passenger. robles did not identify sanchez based on his face, but rather is buil[d]gray shirt. sanchez is five feet four inches tall. after robles thank you, although robles freely admitted that he was le who had and was expecting to find the robbers, robles and he did not identify any of the other people he was shown as being involved in the robbery. ii. procedural background the people charged (1) juarez and sanchez with robbery (pen. code,  211),2 and (2) juarez with evading a police officer (veh. code,  2800.2, subd. (a)). the people further alleged that juarez personally used a firearm ( 12022.53, subd. (b)), and that a principal was armed with a firearm ( 12022, subd. (a)(1)). the assaulting a peace officer or firefighter with a deadly weapon within the meaning of our three strikes law ( 667, subds. (b)-(j) & 1170.12, subds. (a)-(d)) and subd. (a)). the people lastly alleged that this conviction as well as his 2011 conviction for resisting an executive officer ( 69) also constituted prior prison terms ( 667.5, subd. (b)). 2 all further statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise indicated. 6 robles identified juarez and sanchez as the driver and passenger, respectively, at both the preliminary hearing and at trial. the jury convicted both defendants of robbery, convicted juarez of evading a police officer, and found true both of the firearm allegations regarding the robbery. in a bifurcated bench trial, the court found true the prior conviction allegations regarding juarez. the court sentenced juarez to a 19-year prison sentence. specifically, the court imposed 19 years for the robbery count, comprised of a four-year base sentence (two years, doubled plus 10 years for use court imposed a two-year concurrent sentence on the evading police count. the court sentenced sanchez to five years of formal probation, including the time he had already served in jail. both defendants filed notices of appeal. discussion i. instructional error the parties presented evidence for four days; the jury was instructed on the law and the parties made their closing arguments on the fifth day. the jury began to deliberate at 4:01 p.m. on that fifth day and deliberated for 27 minutes before breaking for the evening. the next morning, the trial court excused one of the jurors and substituted in one of the alternate jurors. when the court did so, the court instructed the jury to to the deliberation room a the jury deliberated for 17 minutes prior to lunch and 92 minutes after lunch before reaching its verdicts. juarez and l the jury that it 7 needed to disregard its deliberations occurring prior to the substitution violated their right to a 12-member jury under the california constitution. because this claim turns on the application of law to undisputed facts, our review is de novo. (people v. christman (2014) 229 cal.app.4th 810, 815.) a trial court has the discretion under section 1089 to discharge a juror in the midst of deliberations and to alternate . . . take a place in the jury box, . . . subject to the same rules and regulations as though the alternate juror had been selected as one of thto give effect to the shall he (people v. collins (1976) 17 cal.3d 687, 694, overruled on other grounds in people v. boyette (2002) 29 cal.4th 381, 462, fn. 19; people v. renteria (2001) 93 cal.app.4th 552, 558-559 (renteria); accord, calcrim no. 3575 [so instructing].) a trial court does not satisfy this requirement resume their deliberations starting over with the new trial jurorpeople v. martinez (1984) 159 cal.app.3d 661, 665 (martinez), italics omittedfrom scratch so that [the alternate juror] has full benefit of everything that has gone on . . . up to the present timepeople v. odle (1988) 45 cal.3d 386, 405); or by implicitly treating the prior ing to the request for a readback of testimony (people v. guillen (2014) 227 cal.app.4th 934, 1030 (guillen)). 8 the jury had by that point already been in deliberations for 27 minutes. to be sure, as we discuss below, it is far from clear that the jury in that brief time did more than discharge its first duty to select a foreperson. but the jury had met to delibeto martinez, supra, 159 cal.app.3d at p. 665.) this error, however, does not always mandate reversal. (renteria, supra, 93 cal.app.4th at p. 559.) instead, reversal is verdict would have been returned had the jury been properly martinez, supra, 159 cal.app.3d at p. 665, citing people v. watson (1956) 46 cal.2d 818, 836.) in assessing whether such a reasonable probability exists close one, of] the time the jury spent deliberating before and after the substitution of the alternate juror.people v. proctor (1992) 4 cal.4th 499, 537.) the two factors interact: where a jury has convened for a sufficient period of time prior to the substitution for it to have deliberated on the merits and where it is a close case, courts have concluded that a different result is reasonably probable. (renteria, at pp. 560-casmartinez, at pp. 665-666 [jury deliberates for two and one-quarter hours prior to substitution, reversal warranted].) where the case is not close or the pre- 9 substitution deliberations are hold that a different result is reasonably probable. (proctor, at pp. 536-538 [jury deliberates for less than an hour prior to substitution, deliberates for two and one-half days afterwards, warranted]; guillen, supra, 227 cal.app.4th at pp. 1031-1032 [jury deliberates briefly prior to substitution, deliberates nine days afterwards, and strong evidence on lesser included offense on which guilty verdict was returned; reversal not warranted].) applying these factors, we conclude a different verdict is not reasonably probable in this case. as we discuss below when assessing the sufficiency of the evidence, the evidence in this case is far from overwhelming, but this more importantly, the jury in this case only met for 27 minutes prior to for the jury to engage in any meaningful deliberation on the merits that it would need to be told to disregard. what is more, the jury then took a far greater amount of timeindeed, four times as long as its pre-substitution meetingto deliberate once the alternate juror joined the jury. on these facts, the instructional error does not warrant reversal. ii. ineffective assistance of counsel defendants contend that their trial counsel were constitutionally ineffective because they (1) did not seek to s identifications on the ground that the people failed to preserve evidence as to the identities of the other five people found in the south concord street house, and (2) did not seek to suppress s identifications of defendants as unconstitutionally suggestive. 10 to establish that counsel was constitutionally ineffective, a criminal defendant bears the burden of showing that (1) his an objective standard of reasonableness . . . under prevailing professional norms, [y] people v. mickel (2016) 2 cal.5th 181, 198, quoting people v. lopez (2008) 42 actions fall within the broad range of reasonableness [and must] afford because the record on appeal may not explain why counsel chose (mickel, at p. 198objection is not deficient performance (people v. lucero (2000) 23 [c]ounsel may not be deemed incompetent for failure to make mewhether the objections defendants now say their counsel should have raised have merit. we review claims of ineffective assistance de novo. (people v. mayfield (1993) 5 cal.4th 142, 199.) a. failure to preserve evidence police officers filled out field identification cards on the five people other than juarez and sanchez found inside the south concos iphone. at some point thereafter, they lost those cards. defendants argue that this error makes it impossible for them to identify the other inhabitants of the south concord street house and to reconstruct the showup procedure at which robles identified juarez and 11 sanchez, and violates due process because it constitutes either (1) the suppression of material evidence, in violation of brady v. maryland (1963) 373 u.s. 83 (brady), or (2) the destruction of material evidence, in violation of california v. trombetta (1984) 467 u.s. 479 (trombetta). does not violate brady. under brady, prosecutors have a duty not to suppress evidence that is favorable to the defense and material if that evidence is in their possession. (people v. masters (2016) 62 cal.4th 1019, 1066-1067.) here, the field identification cards were lost; they were accordingly not in the possession of either the prosecutor or the investigating agency. this is fatal to any brady claim. (people v. lucas (2014) 60 cal.4th 153, 221 (lucas) he constitutional due process rights of a defendant may be implicated when he or she is denied access to favorable evidence possession,, overruled on other grounds in people v. romero and self (2015) 62 cal.4th 1; people v. whalen (2013) 56 cal.4th 1, 64 [brady mandates 3 eserve the field identification cards also does not violate trombetta. trombetta applies when the il[s] to preserve evidence.lucas, supra, 60 cal.4th at p. 221.) trombetta and its follow-on case, arizona v. youngblood (1988) 488 u.s. 51, place two duties on police agencies with regard to preserving evidence: if the evidence has and by other reasonably 3 we accordingly have no occasion to decide whether the field identification cards are either favorable to the defense or material. 12 available means, its destruction violates due process; however, if the evidence might be useful to the defense but does not have process only if the police act in bad faith. (people v. carrasco (2014) 59 cal.4th 924, 961-962; people v. depriest (2007) 42 cal.4th 1, 41-42.) the names and contact information of the five other people inside the south concord street house does not have hether reconstructing the showup with them would undermine or s positive identifications of juarez and sanchez. moreover, there is no evidence that the police acted in bad faith in losing the field identification cards. thus, defendants cannot meet the pertinent standards for relief under trombetta and its progeny. defendants point us to two groups of cases, suggesting that they establish that the loss of the field identification cards is s identifications. first, they cite people v. ratliff (1986) 41 cal.3d 675 and people v. posten (1980) 108 cal.app.3d 633. to be sure, both of these cases indicate that the destruction of evidence relating to an out-of-court identification by itself warrants suppression of that identification. (ratliff, at p. 690; posten, at pp. 646-647.) but both of these cases cite people v. hitch (1974) 12 cal.3d 641 as support for their rule. (ratliff, at p. 690; posten, at p. 646.) our supreme court has subsequently held that hitch . . . has not survived trombettapeople v. johnson (1989) 47 cal.3d 1194, 1234.) consequently, the hitch-based rule in ratliff and posten is no longer good law. second, defendants point us to three federal decisions that are at least 45 years old. (see united states v. augello (2d cir. 1971) 451 f.2d 1167; 13 united states v. bryant (d.c. cir. 1971) 448 f.2d 1182; united states v. heath (9th cir. 1958) 260 f.2d 623.) they do not apply the pertinent legal standard announced in trombetta and are, for that reason alone, irrelevant. b. failure to move to suppress showup identification right to due process is violated when a court that defendant if the identification procedure was unduly suggestive and unnecessarythe identification itself was [not otherwise] reliable under the totality of the circumstances. [citation.]people v. clark (2016) 63 cal.4th 522, 556.) in assessing whether an identification procedure is unduly suggestive (the first step), courts ask whether the procedure uggests . . . people v. brandon (1995) 32 cal.app.4th 1033, 1052, citing people v. hunt (1977) 19 cal.3d 888, 893; people v. ochoa (1998) 19 cal.4th 353, 413 (ochoat something to the witness.) in assessing whether an identification is otherwise reliable (the second step), courts look (1)] the opportunity of the witness to view the suspect at the time of the offense, [(2)offense, [(3)] the accuracy of his or her prior description of the suspect, [(4)] the level of certainty demonstrated at the time of the identification, and [(5)] the lapse of time between the offense people v. cunningham (2001) 25 cal.4th 926, 989 (cunningham).) the defendant bears the burden of satisfying both steps. (ibid.) 14 in this case, the police employed a variation of a showup procedure by asking robles to try to identify the driver and passenger of the motorcycle from the four to seven people found in the south concord street house and showed robles those individuals one at a time rather than as a group at the same tinherently unfairochoa, supra, 19 cal.4th at p. 413, quoting people v. floyd (1970) 1 cal.3d 694, 714; people v. medina (1995) 11 cal.4th 694, 753.) although the police told robles they were showing him the people from inside the south concord street house where his iphone had been found and did not explicitly tell him that the robbery suspects may not be among the people he would be viewing, robles distinguished among the people he was shownidentifying some and not identifying othersand there is no evidence indicating that the police told robles whom to identify. (accord, in re carlos m. (1990) 220 cal.app.3d 372, 386-387 [ability of defendant to identify some persons but not others counsels against finding of unduly suggestive procedure].) defendants raise a number of further arguments, none of which has merit. first, they seem to suggest that showups are categorically suspect and inherently suggestive. for support, they cite cases expressing distrust of eyewitness testimony generally (e.g., united states v. wade (1967) 388 u.s. 218, 228 [noting the vagaries of eshowups specifically (e.g., people v. nation (1980) 26 cal.3d 169, 180). although this precedent could be construed to wholly condemn showups as an investigative technique, courts have not read that precedent so brthe element of sugges 15 the reliability of an identification made while the events are fresh people v. garcia (2016) 244 cal.app.4th 1349, 1359.) second, defendants assert that the showup in this case was itself suggestive. to begin, they point out that the police told robles that his iphone had been recovered and that they were bringing him to the south concord street location so he could look at who we caught . . . after he identified two people and told him he people v. perkins (1986) 184 cal.app.3d 583, 588; people v. boyd (1990) 222 cal.app.3d 541, 574; accord, people v. king (1968) 266 cal.app.2d 437, 464-466 [showing defendant a single photograph of defendant, then doing a showup of just the about whether the identification procedure was suggestive]; people v. evans (1952) 39 cal.2d 242, 244-246, 252 [same procedure found to be suggestive]; people v. slutts (1968) 259 cal.app.2d 886, 891-892 -pack to match estive].) although the better practice would have been for the police to have told robles that the robbers might not be among the persons he was to be shown, the showup procedure employed here was not unduly suggestive because the police showed robles more than the number of persons involved in the crime; the police did not tell or otherwise intimate to robles which persons he should select; and robles did, in fact, select some suspects and not select others. 16 further, sanchez argues that robles impermissibly selected him simply because he was the shortest person among the people shown and that this fact alone renders the showup suggestive. sanchez is wrong factually and legally. he is as well as his stature. sanchez is incorrect legally because the spects through an in-field showto have similar looking people available for comparison; the absence of similar looking he legality of [an] in-field showpeople v. rodriguez (1987) 196 cal.app.3d 1041, 1049; cf. people v. carpenter (1997) 15 cal.4th 312, 366-367 [police-constructed lineup must avoid having the defendant , superseded on other grounds by  1054 et seq.; cunningham, supra, 25 cal.4th at pp. 989-990 [applying same rule to police-constructed photospread].) iii. sufficiency of the evidence defendants contend that there is insufficient evidence that they were the motorcycle driver and passenger who robbed we review the entire record in the light most favorable to the judgment to determine whether it contains substantial evidencethat is, evidence that is reasonable, credible, and of solid valuefrom which a reasonable trier of fact could find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. [citation.]people v. covarrubias (2016) 1 cal.5th 838, 890.) in undertaking this task, the reviewing court neither ibid.) construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict, there was sufficient evidence tying juarez and sanchez to the charged crimes. robles identified juarez and sanchez at 17 the showup, at the preliminary hearing, and at trial. because suffica people v. boyer s consistent and repeated identifications are themselves sufficient evidence. beyond that, juarez and sanchez were found in the same house as the iphone stolen from robles; what is more, they were hidingjuarez in the crawl-space attic and sanchez behind a couch. the iphone was found in the same room as the clothing sanchez and juarez had been seen wearing by robles, by the police in the patrol car, and by the observer in the first helicopter. a motorcycle was found just outside the house, and two helmets were recoveredone by the motorcycle, a second in the house. defendants raise four challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence. first, they seem to suggest that there is insufficient evidence once s identification testimony is excluded as the product of an unduly suggestive identification procedure. however, as discussed above, that evidence was properly admitted. s identification, even if admitted, is inherently improbable. to be sure, a reviewing testimony was believable iis physically impossible or inherently improbable.people v. prunty (2015) 62 cal.4th 59, 89; oldham v. kizer (1991) 235 cal.app.3d 1046, 1065-1066 [testimony may be disbelieved on appeal if it is unbelievable per se wholly unacceptable to reasonable mindss testimony was 10 to four to six seconds, and 18 did so by the light of a streetlamp; he explained that, although both were wearing helmets, their eyes and noses were not covered; and he picked the two of them out of a larger group of suspects he was shown. to be sure, robles could not see juarez o three houses away during the showup, but he identified sanchez on the basis of his stature and clothing, and he subsequently and repeatedly identified both of them from within the relatively close confines of a courtroom. third, defendants argue that there is people v. blakeslee (1969) 2 cal.app.3d 831, 839)namely, no fingerprints on the motorcycle and no dna matching either defendant on the helmet recovered near the motorcycle. our task here is to evaluate the evidence that was presented to the jury, not the evidence that was not; as discussed above, the evidence that was presented was sufficient. lastly, and most forcefully, defendants assert that substantial evidence undercuts the persuasiveness of s identifications. they cite: s initial observation of his robbers (that is, for mere seconds while they were both wearing helmets); (2) the inadequacy of the showup procedure (that is, robles viewed the persons from two or three houses away, the police did not require the suspects to sit on a motorcycle or wear a helmet, and the police did not require ); (3) the on the unreliability of eyewitness identifications; and, with respect to , s stature and the inconsistencies regarding whether the 19 y shirt had a hood, and whether the passenger was 12 or 13 years old or just short. none of these arguments undermines the sufficiency of the evidence. taking the arguments in reverse order, it is well established that inconsistencies in identification testimony do (people v. mohamed (2011) 201 cal.app.4th 515, 522.) nor is s identification of sanchez at the showup entitled to no er to identify him ty of a defendant may be established by proof of any peculiarities of size, appearance, similarity of voice, ibid.; in re corey (1964) 230 cal.app.2d 813, 826 (corey).) robles testified that he identified sanchez at the showup on the basis of his size and clothing; this was permissible. (accord, people v. laird (1924) 69 cal.app. 511, 513-514 (laird) [identification on the basis of stature and clothing adequate].) and although t witness opined that the showup procedure in this case was problematic for a number of reasons, the jury was free to reject his opinion. (people v. brown (2014) 59 cal.4th 86, 101 [jury may disregard 1127b [same].) disagreements with the manner in which the jury evaluated the s identifications.4 4 identification of sanchez, but that officer did not positively identify sanchez at trial. we accordingly do not factor any such identification into our evaluation of the sufficiency of the evidence. 20 weakness of the identification, the incompatibility of and discrepancies in the testimony, . . . the uncertainty of recollection, and the qualification of the identity and lack of positiveness in testimony are matters which go to the weight of the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses and are for the observation and corey, supra, 230 cal.app.2d at pp. 825-826; in re gustavo m. (1989) 214 cal.app.3d 1485, 1497; laird, supra, 69 cal.app. at pp. 513-514.) the trial court instructed the jury at length on the factors relevant to evaluating the reliability and believability of a wi counsel couldand, at length, didquestion robles about his identifications and argued in closing why his testimony should be accepted or rejected. in such instances, the consideration of the evidence and evaluation of the ensuing arguments rests firmly in , and its verdict, once reviewed to ensure the jury was properly instrucwas not inherently improbable, must stand. (people v. gordon (1990) 50 cal.3d 1223, 1244 [so holding].) iv. sentencing errors a. dna assessment the trial court imposed a $20 dna assessment on each defendant pursuant to government code section 76104.7. defendants argue that this was error, and the people agree. so do we. the dna assessment may be imposed when penalty, or forfeiture [is] fines and penalties do not trigger imposition of the dna assessment. (gov. code,  76104.7.) the only other fines and penalties imposed upon defendants in this case were a $40 court operations assessment per count (under  1465.8, subd. (a)(1)), a 21 $30 criminal conviction assessment per count (under gov. code,  70373), and a $300 restitution fine (under  1202.4, subd. (b)). but none of these assessments or fines triggers imposition of the dna assessment. (people v. valencia (2008) 166 cal.app.4th 1392, 1396 [court operations assessments do not trigger dna assessment]; gov. code,  70373, subd. (b) [criminal conviction assessments do not trigger dna assessment]; gov. code,  76104.7, subd. (c)(1) [restitution fines do not trigger dna assessment]; people v. hawkins (2012) 211 cal.app.4th 194, 204 [so holding].) the dna assessment for each defendant must be vacated. b. custody credits juarez argues that the trial court erred in granting him only 375 days of presentence custody credit, calculated as 327 days of actual custody credit plus 48 days of worktime credit. juarez accrues worktime credit at a rate of 15 percent of his actual credit. ( 2933.1, subd. (a).) fifteen percent of 327 is 49, not 48. juarez is accordingly entitled to 49 days of worktime credit, for a total of 376 days of presentence custody credit. 22 disposition the judgment is modified by striking the $20 dna awarding juarez 376 days of presentence custody credit. the clerk of the superior court is directed to forward a certified copy of the corrected abstract of judgment to the department of corrections and rehabilitation. as modified, the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. ______________________, j. hoffstadt we concur: _________________________, acting p. j. ashmann-gerst _________________________, j. chavez
