(a)(1); count 1) and disobeying a domestic relations court order ( 273.6, subd. (a); count 2). on june 19, 2018, the trial court sentenced ornelas moreno to three years in state prison on count 1 and imposed a concurrent term of 364 days on count 2. ornelas moreno stipulated to direct victim restitution in the amount of $1,000. the trial court imposed a restitution fine of $300, a court operations assessment of $40, and a court facilities assessment of $30. discussion 1. sufficiency of evidence ornelas moreno contends the evidence was insufficient to support the conviction for a violation of section 245, subdivision (a)(1). specifically, he argues that his car did not qualify as a deadly weapon because the manner in which he used it was not likely to cause great bodily injury. we reject this argument. when the sufficiency of the evidence is challenged on appeal, the court must review the whole record in the light most favorable to the judgment to determine whether it contains substantial evidencei.e., evidence that is credible and of solid valuefrom which a rational trier of fact could have found the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. people v. nguyen (2015) 5 61 cal.4th 1015, 10541055; people v. zamudio (2008) 43 cal.4th 327, 357; jackson v. virginia (1979) 443 u.s. 307, 318319.) [i]t is the [trier of fact], not the appellate court which must be nguyen, at p. 10551056.) or insufficient evidence is unwarranted unless it appears that upon no hypothesis whatever is there sufficient substantial evidence to support (people v. zamudio, supra, 43 cal.4th at p. 357; people v. manibusan (2013) 58 cal.4th [we] must presume in support of the judgment the existence of every fact [the trier of fact] could reasonably have deduced from the evidence. (people v. zaragoza (2016) 1 cal.5th the findings made by the trier of fact, reversal of the judgment is not warranted simply because the circumstances might also (people v. jennings (2010) 50 cal.4th 616, 639.) as used in section 245, subdivision (a)(1), a deadly weapon any object, instrument, or weapon which is used in such a manner as to be capable of producing and likely to produce, death or great bodily injury. people v. aguilar (1997) 16 cal.4th 1023, 10281029 (aguilar).) some objects have been held to be (id. at p. 1029.) (aguilar, supra, 16 cal.4th at p. 1029.) however, under certain id. at p. 1030; people v. brown (2012) 210 cal.app.4th 1, 67 (brownan object not inherently deadly or dangerous is used as such, the 6 trier of fact may consider the nature of the object, the manner in (aguilar, supra, 16 cal.4th at p. 1029.) in re b.m. (2018) 6 cal.5th 528, 534536, clarified this standard by considering the following factors: (1) whether the object was capable of producing and likely to produce death or great bodily injury; (2) how the object was actually used; and (3) the extent of actual injury or lack of injury. first, ornelas moreno used a car. we are not evaluating innocuous items. (see in re b.m., supra, 6 cal.5th at pp. 536537 [butter knife]; people v. beasley (2003) 105 cal.app.4th 1078, 1087 [broomstick]; people v. page (2004) 123 cal.app.4th 1466, 1473 [pencil](people v. bipialaka (2019) 34 cal.app.5th 455, 458.) when misused, cars are capable of producing, and likely to produce, death or great bodily injury. 2 they weigh several thousand pounds and occupy roads frequented by vehicular and pedestrian traffic. (see people v. russell, supra, 129 cal.app.4th at p. 785.) 2 (see, e.g. people v. bipialaka, supra, 34 cal.app.5th at p. 458 [car driven at another car in an intersection but collision avoided]; people v. oehmigen (2014) 232 cal.app.4th 1, 5 [car driven at police vehicle]; people v. aznavoleh (2012) 210 cal.app.4th 1181, 1183 [car raced through red light and collided with another car]; people v. golde (2008) 163 cal.app.4th 101, 106107 [car accelerated toward victim and pursued her]; people v. russell (2005) 129 cal.app.4th 776, 779 [victim pushed into path of oncoming car]; people v. wright (2002) 100 cal.app.4th 703, 705 [truck driven close to persons]; people v. finney (1980) 110 cal.app.3d 705, 716 [car rammed into chasing police cars]; people v. claborn (1964) 224 cal.app.2d 38, 41 [car aimed at police car].) 7 they likely produce death and great bodily injury when projected at other cars or persons. second, ornelas moreno used a car as a deadly weapon. he make a turn. no other cars or obstacles blocked his path to her. although no expert testimony was presented, elorriaga martinez estimated that ornelas moreno accelerated his car to 50 miles ornelas moreno estimated that he collided into 3035 miles per hour. ornelas moreno aimed his car directly at did he apply his brakes and swerve to collide with the rear the right rear tire was pushed in, and the passenger side was front end damage to his car, including the hood and headlights. airbags deployed. the evidence showed that he purposefully injury was likely. third, michelle m. was injured. actual injury to a victim and physical contact are not required to support a conviction. (brown, supra, 210 cal.app.4th at p. 7; in re d.t. (2015) 237 cal.app.4th 693, 699.) if injuries do result, their nature and location are relevant for determining whether an object was used in a manner capable of producing and likely to produce great bodily injury or death. (brown, at p. 7; in re d.t., at p. 699; in re b.m., supra, 6 cal.5th at p. 536.) michelle m. hit her head and chest, as well as her leg. she went to the emergency room. she injured vital areas, not only her extremities. for one week after 8 the collision, she felt pain, consisting of headaches, back pain, and soreness. the evidence shows that serious injury was likely, even if it did not come to pass. viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the used the car as a deadly weapon is supported by substantial evidence. 2. section 654 does not prohibit the sentence on count 2 ornelas moreno argues that under section 654, the trial court should have stayed the sentence for count 2 for violating a restraining order because it was based on an indivisible course of conduct with the assault with a deadly weapon in count 1. we reject his argument. section 654, subdivision (a), provides, that is punishable in different ways by different provisions of law shall be punished under the provision that provides for the longest potential term of imprisonment, but in no case shall the under section 654 requires a two-step inquiry, because the discrete physical act but also a course of conduct encompassing several acts pursued with a single objective.people v. corpening (2016) 2 cal.5th 307, 311 (corpening).) first, we determine if the different crimes were completed by a single physical act. (people v. jones (2012) 54 cal.4th 350, 358 (jones); corpening, supra, 2 cal.5th at p. 311.) if so, section 654 bars multiple punishment for the multiple offenses. (jones, at p. 358; corpeningwhether some action the defendant is charged with having taken 9 separately completes the actus reus for each of the relevant criminal offenses.corpening, at p. 313.) the facts of the case dictate whether multiple convictions are based on a single physical act. (id. at p. 312; people v. mesa (2012) 54 cal.4th 191, 196.) when the facts are undisputed, the application of section 654 raises a question of law, which is reviewed under the de novo standard. (corpening, at p. 312.) second, if the case involves more than a single act, we course of conduct single intent and objective versus multiple intents and objectives. (people v. correa (2012) 54 cal.4th 331, 335336 (correa); jones, supra, 54 cal.4th at p. 359; corpening, supra, 2 cal.5th at p. 311; people v. mesa, supra, 54 cal.4th at p. 199.) section 654 applies where there was a course of conduct which violated more than (people v. perez (1979) 23 cal.3d 545, 551; people v. martin (2005) 133 cal.app.4th 776, 781.) if the offenses were incident to one objective, the defendant may not be punished for more than one. (correa, at p. 336; perez, at p. 551.) but if the defendant harbored multiple objectives, he or she may be punished for each offense, even though they shared common acts. (people v. latimer (1993) 5 cal.4th 1203, 1208; people v. beamon (1973) 8 cal.3d 625, 639.) we only reach this second step if more than one physical act served as the basis for convicting the defendant of multiple separate crimes. (jones, at pp. 359360; corpening, at p. 316.) when a trial court sentences a defendant for two crimes, without suspending the sentence for one, it implicitly finds the acts involve more than one objective. (people v. osband (1996) 13 cal.4th 622, 730731; people v. islas (2012) 210 cal.app.4th 116, 10 the substantial evidence standard of review. (islas, at p. 129; people v. saffle (1992) 4 cal.app.4th 434, 438; osband, at pp. 730most favorable to the judgment and presume the existence of every fact that could reasonably be deduced from the evidence. (people v. cleveland (2001) 87 cal.app.4th 263, 271.) was the basis of the violation of the domestic relations court order.3 michelle m. first noticed ornelas moreno as he was driving out of the subway parking lot. he left the parking lot, but he returned to a location across the street. by driving away and returning, ornelas moreno completed the act necessary for a violation of section 273.6, subdivision (a). from his failure to stay away from her. his second act occurred after michelle m. drove out of the driveway and positioned her car in the left turn lane. he was waiting on pico boulevard, across the street from the subway. when he had a clear path to resulted in the assaultive collision. the assault occurred after guilt was already established for the violation of section 273.6, subdivision (a). a distinct separation in time delineated the two acts. two minutes elapsed between michelle m. leaving the subway and 3 the trial court instructed the jury with calcrim no. 2701, which required proof that a court lawfully issued a written order that the defendant stay away from michelle m. (see calcrim no. 2701.) 11 ornelas moreno assaulting her. the separation in time was brief, but even simultaneous physical acts can be distinct for purposes of section 654. (jones, supra, 54 cal.4th at p. 358.) ornelas moreno positioned his car across the street from the subway, where he remained. this separation in time afforded ornelas moreno an opportunity to reflect before committing the next crime. (people v. louie (2012) 203 cal.app.4th 388, 399; people v. beamon, supra, 8 cal.3d at p. 639, fn. 11; people v. gaio (2000) 81 cal.app.4th 919.) implicit finding that ornelas moreno harbored separate objectives for the separate acts. we accordingly affirm the trial 3. due process claims for direct victim restitution order, restitution fine, and assessments ornelas moreno claims that the trial court erred in imposing the victim restitution order, the restitution fine, court operations assessment, and court facilities assessment, without having ascertained his ability to pay. he relies on people v. dueas (2019) 30 cal.app.5th 1157 (dueas), which held that due process of law requires the trial court to conduct an ability to pay hearing before it imposes the assessments, and stay the restitution fine until ability to pay has been demonstrated. first, dueas does not apply to direct victim restitution. (dueas, supra, 30 cal.app.5th at p. 1169.) accordingly, we to pay was required before the trial court ordered direct victim restitution. second, as to the restitution fine and assessments, the attorney general argues that ornelas moreno forfeited his 12 challenge on appeal because he did not raise his objection in the trial court. as ornelas moreno concedes, he raised no objection in the trial court based on his inability to pay. the statutes authorizing the restitution fine and ability to pay. ( 1202.4, subd. (c); 1465.8, subd. (a); gov. code,  dueas had not yet been decided. division 7 of this district held in people v. castellano fine and fees, before dueas was decided, was not a forfeiture of the issue. (people v. castellano (2019) 33 cal.app.5th 485, 489; people v. johnson (2019) 35 cal.app.5th 134, 137138.) the court reasoned that the holding of dueas announced constitutional principle that could not reasonably (castellano, at p. 489.) the court commented that prior to dueasimpose fines, fees or assessments without a determination of the (ibid.) disagreeing with castellano, division 8 of this district in people v. frandsen decided that failure to object to the restitution fine and assessments amounted to forfeiture. (people v. frandsen (2019) 33 cal.app.5th 1126, 1154; people v. bipialaka, supra, 34 cal.app.5th at p. 464.) dueas relies on longstanding due process principles and precedent. (dueas, supra, 30 cal.app.5th discussing griffin v. illinois (1956) 351 u.s. 12, 16; in re antazo (1970) 3 cal.3d 100, 108; bearden v. georgia (1983) 461 u.s. 660, 667668.).) frandsen did not view dueas a dramatic and unforeseen change in the law 13 allow for an exception to the forfeiture doctrine. (frandsen, at p. 1154.) we need not decide whether ornelas moreno forfeited his challenge to the restitution fine and assessments because we conclude any error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. (chapman v. california (1967) 386 u.s. 18, 24; people v. johnson, supra, 35 cal.app.5th at pp.139140.) although it is tablish his eligibility for relief, we find the error harmless because the record demonstrates he cannot make such a showing. (people v. jones (2019) 36 cal.app.5th 1028, 1035.) ornelas moreno contends that he is unable to pay the restitution fine and assessments, which total $370. he does not ground his contention in any facts in the record, but asserts that he currently lacks income and assets. we reject his contention. ability to pay does not require existing employment or money on hand. (people v. staley (1992) 10 cal.app.4th 782, when the person has no physical, mental or emotional impediment which precludes the person from finding and maintaining employment. (see id. at p. 786.) here, the record shows no such impediment. ornelas moreno has capacity to earn, unlike the defendant in dueas, who was a mother of two children, suffered from cerebral palsy, and had no home nor job. ornelas moreno is a certified optician with some college education. he lives with his family in a home. he was 24 years old when sentenced. his prior employment shows past income-earning ability. there is no reason to believe that he will be unable able to secure employment and earn an income when released from prison. 14 is evaluated in light of his total financial obligations, which includes direct victim restitution. (see people v. castellanos (2009) 175 cal.app.4th 1524, 1531; people v. corrales (2013) 213 cal.app.4th 696, 702; people v. valenzuela (2009) 172 cal.app.4th 1246, 1250.) however, the $1,000 restitution amount does not change our conclusion. first, the amount is not excessive. second, his stipulation to the amount demonstrates hirepresentation by private counsel, his posting of bail twice during the pendency of this case,4 and residence with his family also suggest that he has access to financial resources. based on the record, any reasonable trial court would still have imposed the restitution fine and assessments even if it had dueas. remand would be futile. accordingly, we conclude any error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. 4 the record shows that ornelas moreno initially posted a bond for a $60,000 bail amount. because ornelas moreno arrived late for one of his court dates, the trial court issued a bench warrant with a bail amount of $75,000, and ordered the original bail forfeited. when ornelas moreno did appear, the trial court remanded him into custody. he later posted another bond for $75,000. the trial court remanded ornelas moreno into custody when the jury convicted him. 15 disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports hanasono, j.* we concur: edmon, p. j. lavin, j. * judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
