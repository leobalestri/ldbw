(e)(2)(c)(iii), and 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(c)(iii), which disqualified him from resentencing consideration. we affirmed this ruling on appeal (see people v. soto (2014) formerly published at 228 cal.app.4th 967, review granted october 15, 2014 (soto ii), but our supreme court subsequently granted sotos petition for review and transferred the matter back to us for reconsideration in light of people v. johnson (2015) 61 cal.4th 674 (johnson). we have received supplemental briefing from the parties and, as explained below, we again hold the trial court correctly determined that soto was ineligible for resentencing under the act. background viewed in accordance with the usual rules of appellate review (people v. ochoa (1993) 6 cal.4th 1199, 1206), the evidence established the following. on september 7, 1997, los angeles county deputy sheriff randy hasnas made a traffic stop on a white buick being driven by soto. hasnas stopped the vehicle because soto appeared to be drinking a beer as he was driving. soto was alone in the vehicle, and when hasnas walked up to the drivers side he saw a clear plastic bag containing a white substance . hasnas could also see what appeared to be a grip of a handgun protruding from below the front seat. after hasnas ordered soto out of the buick, he saw 1 all further statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise stated. 3 he was driving. from underneath the car seat, hasnas recovered a colt semiautomatic .45-caliber handgun that was loaded with a second ammunition clip. the white substance inside the plastic bag was subsequently analyzed and found to contain 4.19 grams of cocaine. defense witness peter del real testified that on september 6, 1997, the day before the traffic stop, he borrowed sotos buick to give a ride to a friend. del real testified he had a gun with him that day, which he placed under the car seat. del real identified the gun that deputy hasnas recovered as the same gun he had left in the buick. del real testified that when he returned the buick to soto he neglected to say anything about the gun, which was out of sight underneath the front seat. del real testified he left one ammunition clip loaded into the gun, and that a second ammunition clip was sitting on top of the gun just right there under the seat with the gun. the jury convicted soto of possessing a controlled substance (count 1), transporting a controlled substance (count 2), and being a felon in possession of a firearm (count 3). (health & saf. code,  11350, 11352, subd. (a); pen. code [former]  12021, subd. (a)2.) the jury found true an allegation that, in the commission of count 2, soto had been personally armed with a firearm ( 12022, subd. (c)). he also admitted two prior robbery convictions (667, subds. (b)-(i)). the trial court sentenced soto as follows: on count 1, to a prison term of 25 years to life, plus three years for the firearm enhancement; on count 2, to a term of 25 years to life, which was then stayed under section 654 (the prohibition against multiple punishment)3; and, on count 3, to a concurrent term of 25 years to life. 2 the deadly weapons recodification act of 2010 repealed and recodified former sections 12000 to 12809 without substantive change. ( 16000, 16005, 16010.) former section 12021, subdivision (a), was recodified without substantive change at section 29800, subdivision (a) operative january 1, 2012. (cal. law revision com. com., 14 ann. pen. code (2012 ed.) foll.  29800, p. 921.) 3 section 654, subdivision nishable in different ways by different provisions of law shall be punished under the provision that provides for the longest potential term of imprisonment, but in no case shall the act or omission be punished under more than one provision. an acquittal or conviction and sentence under any one bars a prosecution for the same ac 4 on appeal from the conviction, soto contended that his sentence for the drug possession offense (count 1) should not have been enhanced by three years, a claim that was conceded by the attorney general. in our 1999 decision in this matter (people v. soto (sept. 17, 1999, b122916) [nonpub. opn.] (soto i))4, we concluded the parties were correct and remanded for resentencing. on remand, the trial court struck the enhancement and sentenced soto to 25 years to life on count 1. the court then imposed the same sentences on counts 2 and 3 that had been imposed originally, and the sentence on count 2 was again stayed under section 654. in 2013, after proposition 36 was enacted, soto sought resentencing. the superior court (judge william c. ryan) denied on the ground that his current offense falls under penal code section 667(e)(2)(c)(iii) [armed with firearm during commission of current offense], making defendant ineligible for resentencing under penal code section 1170.126. in his appeal to this court from the denial of his resentencing petition, soto argued that even if his count 2 arming enhancement disqualified him from proposition 36 resentencing on count 2, he was still eligible for resentencing on the other counts. we count 2 conviction rendered him entirely ineligible for resentencing. (soto ii) soto petitioned for review. the supreme court granted review and deferred further action pending its consideration of a related issue in other cases. the supreme court thereafter transferred the matter back to this court for reconsideration in light of its 2015 decision in johnson, supra, 61 cal.4th 674. the johnson decision held that proposition 36 requires an inmates eligibility for resentencing to be evaluated on a count-by-count basis. so interpreted, an inmate may obtain resentencing with respect to a three-strikes sentence imposed for a felony that is neither serious nor violent, despite the fact that the inmate remains subject to a third strike 4 we take judicial notice of this unpublished opinion. (evid. code,  452 subd. (d); cal. rules of court, rule 8.1115(b).) 5 sentence of 25 years to life. (johnson, supra, 61 cal.4th at p. 688.) we now reconsider our decision in soto ii in light of johnson. discussion 1. the act. johnson, supra, 61 cal.4th 674, summarized the acts purpose and provisions as follows: prior to its amendment by the act, the three strikes law required that a defendant who had two or more prior convictions of violent or serious felonies receive a third strike sentence of a minimum of 25 years to life for any current felony conviction, even if the current offense was neither serious nor violent. (former  667, subds. (d), (e)(2)(a), 1170.12, subds. (b), (c)(2)(a).)[5] the [prospective portions of the] act[6] amended the three strikes law with respect to defendants whose current conviction is for a felony that is neither serious nor violent. in that circumstance, unless an exception applies, the defendant is to receive a second strike sentence of twice the term otherwise provided for the current felony, pursuant to the provisions that apply when a defendant has one prior conviction for a serious or violent felony. ( 667, subd. (e)(2)(c), 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(c); see  667.5, subd. (c) [list of violent felonies], 1192.7 [list of serious felonies], 1192.8 [additional serious felonies for purposes of  1192.7].) the acts exceptions to the new sentencing provisions relate to a defendants current offense and prior offenses. if the current offense involves controlled substances and specified findings are made concerning the quantity of controlled substances involved, or if the current offense is among specified sex offenses, a defendant with two or more strikes must be sentenced to a term of at least 25 years to life. [fn. omitted.] ( 667, 5 the three strikes law was enacted twice in 1994, first by the legislature ( 667, subds. (b)-(i); stats. 1994, ch. 12,  1, p. 71), and thereafter by the voters by way of proposition 184 ( 1170.12; [citation]). (johnson, supra, 61 cal.4th at p. 681, fn. 1.) 6 the prospective provisions of the act ( 667, subd. (e)(2)(c), 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(c)) apply to individuals whose current offense is committed after the effective date of the act. 6 subd. (e)(2)(c)(i)-(ii), 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(c)(i)-(ii).) a third strike sentence is also required if, [d]uring the commission of the current offense, the defendant used a firearm, was armed with a firearm or deadly weapon, or intended to cause great bodily injury to another person. ( 667, subd. (e)(2)(c)(iii), 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(c)(iii).) finally, a defendant will be excluded from the new sentencing provisions if he or she suffered a prior conviction for . . . [certain offenses listed in  667, subd. (e)(2)(c)(iv) and  1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(c)(iv) which are sometimes referred to as] super strikes. [citation, fn. omitted.] in addition to reducing the sentence to be imposed for some third strike felonies that are neither violent nor serious, the act provides a procedure by which some prisoners already serving third strike sentences may seek resentencing in accordance with the new sentencing rules. ( 1170.126.) an inmate is eligible for resentencing if . . . [] . . . [t]he inmate is serving an indeterminate term of life imprisonment imposed pursuant to [the three strikes law] for a conviction of a felony or felonies that are not defined as serious and/or violent . . . . ( 1170.126, subd. (e)(1).) like a defendant who is being sentenced under the new provisions, an inmate is disqualified from resentencing if any of the exceptions set forth in section 667, subdivision (e)(2)(c) and section 1170.12, subdivision (c)(2)(c) are present. ( 1170.126, subd. (e).) in contrast to the rules that apply to sentencing, however, the rules governing resentencing provide that an inmate will be denied recall of his or her sentence if the court, in its discretion, determines that resentencing the petitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. ( 1170.126, subd. (f).) (johnson, supra, 61 cal.4th at pp. 680-682.) 2. the trial court correctly ruled that soto was ineligible for resentencing. in this appeal, soto solely contends the trial court erred in finding he is ineligible for proposition 36 resentencing on his count 3 conviction for being a felon in possession of a firearm.7 we disagree. 7 soto asserts that he is challenging of his resentencing petition as to count 3 because he will be eligible to have his count 1 drug possession conviction reduced to a misdemeanor under proposition 47. 7 a. legal principles. ineligibility for resentencing depends on whether, during his violation of former section 12021 for possessing a firearm, he was also armed with a firearm. (see  667, subd. (e)(2)(c)(iii), 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(c)(iii).) . . are that a person, who has previously been convicted of a felony, had in his or her possession or possession of a firearm by a felon may involve the act of personally carrying or being in actual physical possession of a firearm . . . such an act is not an essential element of a violation of former section 12021, subdivision (a), because a conviction of this offense may s constructive possessiestablish constructive possession, the prosecution must prove a defendant knowingly [citation.] hence, while the act of being armed with a firearm that is, having ready access to a firearm [citation] necessarily requires possession of the firearm, possession of a people v. brimmer (2014) 230 cal.app.4th 782, 795.) utilize a firearm or even carry one on the body. a defendant is armed if the defendant has the specified weapon available for use, either offensively or defensively. [citations.] as a the ready access of the weapon people v. bland (1995) 10 cal. 4th 991, 997 (bland).) as a result of these principles, every commitment offense for unlawful possession of a gun necessarily involves being armed with the gun, if the gun is not otherwise available for immediate use in connection with its possession, e.g., where it is s dominion and control in a location not readily accessible to him at the time of its discovery.people v. elder (2014) 227 cal.app.4th 1308, 1313-1314.) 8 found next to his bed. the parolee is in possession of the firearm, because it is under his dominion and control. if he is not home at the time, however, he is not armed with the firearm, because it is not readily available to him for offensive or defensive use. accordingly, possessing a firearm does not necessarily constitute being armed with a people v. osuna (2014) 225 cal.app.4th 1020, 1030, fn. omitted.) numerous cases have concluded that, under proposition 36, a conviction for being a felon in possession of a firearm disqualifies an inmate from resentencing if the nature of that possession amounted to arming as defined in bland. (see, e.g., people v. white (2014) 223 cal.app.4th 512, 525-526 [defendant who tossed away handgun while running from police found to be armed with a firearm and disqualified for purposes of resentencing]; people v. hicks (2014) 231 cal.app.4th 275, 280, 284 [after defendant detained at front gate of apartment complex, gun was found inside his backpack in apartment he had been visiting and he was found to be armed and disqualified from resentencing]; people v. brimmer, supra, 230 cal.app.4th at pp. 796-797 [defendant who threatened his girlfriend with shotgun during argument was found to be armed and not entitled to resentencing]; people v. elder, supra, 227 cal.app.4th at p. 1317 [police found defendant outside his apartment and, inside, found gun on cabinet shelf and second gun in bedroom safe; defendant was found to be armed with a firearm and thus ineligible for resentencing].) soto concedes argues we cannot reach that result in his case because of a ruling we made in his direct appeal. soto had claimed that punishing him for both count 2 (transporting cocaine) and count 3 (felon in possession of a firearm) violated the prohibition against multiple punishment ( 654). we rejected this claim, pointing out that the as early as september 6, 1997 [i.e., the day before the traffic stop], but [he] first transported the cocaine the next day and, therefore, that [he] had multiple criminal objectives. [] moreover, even if [soto] only simultaneously transported the cocaine and possessed the firearm, for all the 9 record reflects, that transportation and possession were simply fortuitous and unrelated(soto i [nonpub. opn.] at p. 14, italics added.) cthere need not be a facilitative nexus8 between the (here being a felon in possession of a firearm) and the disqualifying factor of ed during the commission of that offense. in ony for additional punishment to be imposed (italics added), the act disqualifies an inmate from d]uring the y defined as s 3d new internat. dict. (1993) p. 703.) thus, there must be a temporal nexus between the arming and the underlying felony, not a facilitative one. the two are not the same. people v. hicks, supra, 231 cal.app.4th at pp. 283-284, italics added; accord people v. brimmer, supra, 230 cal.app.4th at pp. 798-799; people v. osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1032.) 8 for enhancement with the underlying offense (i.e., it serves (people v. brimmer, supra, 230 cal.app.4th at pp. 794-795.) explained by bland, supra, 10 cal.4th at p. 1002: a ( 12022, subd. (a)(1).) with respect to felony drug possession [for instance], a defenddrugs. thus, by specifying that the added penalty applies only if the defendant is armed during the underlying crime and that it have some facilitative nexus evidence that a firearm is kept in close proximity to cache gives rise to the inference that the person in possession of the drugs kept the weapon 10 here, the only evidence regarding the gun was deputy hasnas found it inside , and del on the day before the traffic stop he placed the question for the jury was whether soto knew the gun was in his car; there was no claim by the prosecution that soto was guilty because he had constructive possession of the gun at some other point in time when it was a great distance from his person. the jury had been instructed that, in order to convict soto of the section 12021 each of the following elements must be proved: [] 1. the defendant owned, had in his possession, or had under his control a handgun; [] and [] 2. the defendant had knowledge of the presence of the han during closing argument, the prosecutor told the jury that the gun was right underneath the seat. it is in an area where [soto] is able to exercise control over [it],be visible the gun ,soto had even been . -in-implicit he had a firearm capable for ready use, during the commission of that offense, [therefore] the armed with a firearm exclusion applies and, thus, [soto] is not people v. brimmer, supra, 230 cal.app.4th at p. 805, italic added.) because there was a temporal nexus between the arming and the underlying felony of being a felon in possession of a firearm, the trial court properly ruled that soto was ineligible for resentencing under proposition 36. 11 disposition the post-resentencing is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports edmon, p. j. we concur: aldrich, j. lavin, j.
