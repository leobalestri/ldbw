(b)-(i), 667.5; health & saf. code,  11370.2, subd. (c)). on march 5, 2013, fischer accepted a plea agreement under which he would plead no contest to the drug charge and one count of grand theft auto. his sentence would be calculated as follows: three years for the drug charge, doubled under the three strikes law, plus three years for the prior drug offense enhancement and one year as a prior prison term enhancement, for a total of ten years in state prison (a 16-month term on the grand theft auto conviction would run concurrent). the remaining counts would be dismissed, a restitution fine of between $200 and $10,000 would be imposed, and fischer would remain responsible for direct victim restitution, even on the dismissed counts. in addition, his probation on a former conviction would be terminated. on march 26, 2013, the trial court sentenced fischer according to the terms of the plea agreement, a sentence which included a $2,800 restitution fine. fischer did not file a notice of appeal at that time, but on november 25, 2014, this court ordered the clerk of the superior court to deem a late notice of appeal as timely filed. we appointed counsel to represent fischer. after reviewing the record, appellate counsel filed an opening brief requesting this court to independently review the record pursuant to people v. wende (1979) 25 cal.3d 436, 441. we directed counsel to send the record on appeal and a copy of the opening brief to fischer, and notified him that he had 30 days within which to personally submit any contentions or issues that he wished us to consider. fischer has not filed a supplemental brief. 3 we have examined the entire record and are satisfied that defense counsel has lities and that no arguable appellate issue exists.
