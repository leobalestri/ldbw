filed 9/14/17 p. v. hurth ca2/4 not to be published in the official reports california rules of court, rule 8.1115(a), prohibits courts and parties from citing or relying on opinions not certified for publication or ordered published, except as specified by rule 8.1115(b). this opinion has not been certified for publication or ordered published for purposes of rule 8.1115. in the court of appeal of the state of california second appellate district division four the people, plaintiff and respondent, v. jonathan b. hurth, defendant and appellant. b271126 (los angeles county super. ct. no. ya051658) appeal from a post-judgment order of the superior court of los angeles county, william c. ryan, judge. affirmed. law office of elizabeth k. horowitz and elizabeth k. horowitz, under appointment by the court of appeal, for defendant and appellant. xavier becerra, attorney general, gerald a. engler, chief assistant attorney general, lance e. winters, assistant attorney general, susan sullivan pithey and heather b. arambarri, deputy attorneys general, for plaintiff and respondent. 2 defendant jonathan b. of his petition to reduce his felony convictions for receiving stolen property and second degree burglary to misdemeanors under penal code section 1170.18,1 a provision of proposition 47, the safe neighborhoods and schools act. defendant failed to satisfy his burden of establishing his eligibility to reduce his sentence. accordingly, we affirm the denial of his petition, but do so without prejudice to subsequent consideration of a new, properly supported petition. summary in april 2002, ms. allen (the victim) and her family were locked out of their residence after being evicted. some personal items were left behind. a couple of days after the eviction, a neighbor saw two men, one of whom he identified as defendant, load televisions and other items police, who detained defendant and another man in a brown van nearby. officers recovered numerous electronic items from the van, including a television that belonged to the victim. in august 2002, defendant was convicted of second degree burglary ( 459) and receiving stolen property ( 496, subd. (a)). defendant was sentenced under the three strikes law to 25yearstolife for the burglary ( 667, subds. (b)(i), 1170.12, subds. (a)(d).) the 1 all undesignated code references are to the penal code. 3 sentence was stayed on the second count, pending completion of the sentence for the burglary ( 654). in april 2015, defendant filed a twopage petition seeking to have his sentence recalled under proposition 47, arguing he had been convicted of crimes now classified as misdemeanors, because the value of the property taken was less than $950. ( 1170.18.) although any evidence relating to the value of the property or other issue, the court nevertheless found that a prima face showing of eligibility was made. the district attorney filed an opposition, supported by excerpts of trial testimony. defendant submitted supplemental materials to support his petition, including excerpts of trial testimony and a statement from stanley allen, the nowindicatconnection with the april 2002 incident was less than $500. an eligibility hearing was conducted on march 21, 2016. the regarding the value of the property, the court found defendant d defendant ineligible for proposition 47 relief as to the burglary count, the petition was denied. defendant timely appealed. 4 discussion defendant contends the trial court erred in denying his petition for reclassification of his conviction by refusing to consider evidence outside the record of conviction which demonstrates the value of the stolen property did not exceed $950. 1. the standard of review this appeal presents mixed questions of law and fact. the legal issuewhether the trial court erred in refusing to consider evidence outside the record of convictionis reviewed de novo. (people v. sherow (2015) 239 cal.app.4th 875, 878 (sherow).) factual findings are reviewed for substantial evidence. (people v. johnson (2016) 1 cal.app.5th 953, 960 (johnson).) 2. reclassification of prior conviction of receiving stolen property proposition 47 amended the statute on receiving stolen property to make the offense a misdemeanor unless the value of the stolen property exceeds $950. ( 496, subd. (a), 1170.18, subd. (a).) a defendant submitting a section 1170.18 petition and arguing that a theft crime should be resentenced as a misdemeanor, because the value of the property stolen was $950 or less, has the initial burden of presenting evidence of the value of the property. (johnson, supra, 1 cal.app.5th at pp. 964965; people v. perkins (2016) 244 cal.app.4th 129, 136137 (perkins); sherow, supra, 239 cal.app.4th at p. 879.) 5 some or all of the information or evidence necessary to enable the petition. (sherow, supra, 239 cal.app.4th at p. 880; perkins, supra, 244 cal.app.4th at pp. 136137, 140; johnson, supra, 1 cal.app.5th at p. record of conviction may be enough for the petitioner to establish . . . s felony sentence. (people v. romanowski (2017) 2 cal.5th 903, 916 (romanowski).) more often, however, excluding evidence outside the record of conviction will impede a defendant from meeting his or her burden to prove eligibility under proposition 47, which often turns on establishing key facts not previously adjudicated, e.g., when newly relevant evidence was not an element at the time defendant was convicted, or when a defendant pled guilty. (ibid.) where eligibility for resentencing turns on facts not established by the record of conviction, the court may require an evidentiary hearing if entitled to relief and [his] entitlement to relief depends on the resolution of an issue of fromanowski, supra, 2 cal.5th 904 at p. 916.) that evidence can come from any competent source. (see johnson, supra, 1 cal.app.5th at pp. 968, 971 [petitioner seeking recall of sentence under prop. 47 may present probative evidence from any source]; perkins, supra, 244 cal.app.4th at p. 140, fn. 5 [petitioner may use declarations or any probative evidence]; sherow, supra 6 nature of items taken].) in a case such as this, new evidence offered to demonstrate the value of stolen property was less than $950, may be presented in various forms. of course, facts in the record of conviction relevant to the value of the property may be relied on. (perkins, supra, 244 cal.app.4th at p. 137.) a declaration from the defendant or a also be informative, even sufficient. (see sherow, supra, 239 cal.app.4th at p. 880.) if and once the defendant makes this showing, the ineligibility for resentencing. (johnson, supra, 1 cal.app.5th at p. 965.) if the trial court determines defendant has submitted evidence sufficient to create a dispute as to the value, but has not established his or her eligibility, the court may (sherow, supra, 239 cal.app.4th at p. 880.) proof of eligibility for resentencing or redesignation of a conviction must be made by a preponderance of the evidence. (people v. osuna (2014) 225 cal.app.4th 1020, 1040; people v. bush (2016) 245 cal.app.4th 992, 1001.) 3. analysis mistaken belief that its review was confined to the record of conviction. that was error. excluding evidence outside the record of conviction may impede a defendant from meeting his burden to prove eligibility under proposition 47, if that evidence was not an element at the time 7 defendant was convicted. (romanowski, supra, 2 cal.5th at p. 916; johnson, supra, 1 cal.app.5th at p. 968; perkins, supra, 244 cal.app.4th at p. 140.) here, new evidence was necessary in order for defendant to attempt to demonstrate his eligibility for sentencing within the misdemeanor sthad not been an element of his felony conviction.2 although its stated rationale was mistaken, the trial court did not the value of the stolen property did not exceed $950. in support of his petition, defendant submitted a declaration and two letters from an investigator,3 stanley allen. the letters indicate that, in late october 2015, the investigator met with stanley allen who claimed to recall the incident at his late reviewing a property report, stanley allen provided a short, of 2 nviction for receiving stolen property may be based on was in possession of it, and that the defendant knew the property to be people v. price (1991) 1 cal.4th 324, 464;  496, subd. (a).) 3 the declaration is illegible, and our efforts to obtain a legible copy were unsuccessful. 8 evidence. it is not a declaration, signed under penalty of perjury. it is a confusing, speculative statement by someone who claims no firsthand that the value of one television and some or all unspecified items of was less than $500. this unsworn submission is not competent, probative evidence of the value of the property. (see people v. pak (2016) 3 cal.app.5th 1111, 1121 (pak) [finding no probative evidence sufficient to support prop. nor any witness provided sworn testimony or a sworn affidavit about in re zeth s. (2003) 31 cal.4th 396, 414, people v. lee rn testimony [does] not ithe record of conviction, defendant failed to provide competent evidence that the value of the stolen property did not exceed $950. accordingly, he failed to satisfy his burden of proof as to eligibility. (sherow, supra, 239 cal.app.4th at pp. 878880.) our determination that cannot rest on statement does not preclude him from filing a new petition supported by competent sworn testimony by stanley allen (or other probative evidence) as sufficient proof of value to establish eligibility for relief under proposition 47. (see pak, supra, 3 cal.app.5th at p. 1121 [affirming the denial of prop. 47 petition without 9 describe the stolen property and attach some evidence, whether a declaration, court documents, record citations, or other probative perkins, supra, 244 cal.app.4th at p. 140.) on remand, the trial court has substantial flexibility to devise practical procedures to implement proposition 47, so long as those procedures are consistent with the proposition and any applicable statutory or constitutional requirements. (perkins, supra, 244 cal.app.4th at p. 138.) the court may exercise its discretion to develop submission of additional evidence or by conducting a hearing. both parties will have an opportunity to litigate the valuation issue under the applicable standards on remand. we express no opinion on the merits of that issue. 4. reduction of felony burglary conviction to misdemeanor petty theft on appeal, as below, defendant has properly conceded that his burglary conviction is ineligible for resentencing as misdemeanor [taken from] a commercial establishment within the in re j.l. (2015) 242 cal.app.4th 1108, 1114 [theft of cell phone from high school locker did not occur at a  459.5].) 10 instead, defendant now contends his felony burglary conviction is eligible for resentencing under section 490.2, consistent with the spirit and purpose of proposition 47. he contends that the nonviolent, nonserious conduct that allegedly involved the theft of less than $500 worth of property not from a commercial establishment, but from an unoccupied residence, for which he received a felony burglary conviction (and is serving a life sentence), should more appropriately be treated as misdemeanor petty theft. ( 490.2.) in contrast with the shoplifting statute ( 459.5), there is no requirement under section 490.2 that the defendant have entered a commercial establishment during regular business hours to qualify for proposition 47 sentence reduction. (see people v. sloat (2017) 10 cal.app.5th 761, 762 (sloat).) but the defendant in sloat was convicted of felony petty theft. (sloat, supra, 10 cal.app.4th at p. 762.) here, defendant was convicted of burglary under section 459. section 459.5, subdivision (a) specifically provides that an entry into a commercial establishment with intent to commit larceny that does not satisfy the definition of shoplifting is burglary reading section 490.2 as implicitly amending the definition of burglary in section 459 would render section 459.5 superfluous because it would reduce any burglary conviction based on theft not exceeding $950 to a misdemeanor, regardless of the type of building entered. we cannot construe proposition 47 in a manner that would render an entire statutory provision superfluous.
