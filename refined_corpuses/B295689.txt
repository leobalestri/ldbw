(a)),1 and found true the section 12022.53, subdivision (d) firearm enhancement allegation against him. the trial court sentenced lynex to state prison for a term of 50 years to life, comprised of a term of 25 years to life on the first degree murder charge and an additional 25 years to life for the firearm enhancement. conviction and sentence on july 17, 2001 (people v. lynex (july 17, 2001, b145639) [nonpub. opn.]). the california supreme court denied review on october 10, 2001 (people v. lynex, supra, b145639, review den. oct. 10, 2001, s100271). on january 18, 2019, appellant filed a petition for resentencing in light of senate bill no. 620, which amended the code to permit trial courts discretion to strike the certain previously mandatory firearm sentencing enhancements. lynex attached to the petition documentation of his extensive rehabilitation efforts while in custody, including completion of his high school education, completion of substance abuse classes, parenting, domestic violence 1 unless otherwise indicated, all subsequent statutory references are to the penal code. 3 and anger management classes, and vocational training in several different fields. the trial court denied the petition for resentencing, noting that lynexsentence had become final well before the effective date of senate bill no. 620, and that there was no separate, independent ground for resentencing. lynex timely filed a notice of appeal. on june 3, 2019, appointed counsel filed a wende brief, raising no issues on appeal from the , and requesting that we independently review the record to determine whether the trial court committed any error. on the same day, counsel sent lynex a letter explaining her evaluation of the record on appeal and her intention to file a wende brief. also provided him a copy of the record on appeal and informed lynex of his right to file a supplemental brief. on june 14, 2019, lynex filed a document captioned nd demand for dismissal of criminal case no. pa034126 and court of appeal no. b295689, that shall now be void on it[]s face and lynex shall be ordered by this court released from custody within 72 hours and all charges and attaches the june 3, 2019 appellate counsel, but discusses only various issues unrelated to his petition for resentencing, appeal therefrom, or senate bill no. 620. 4 discussion senate bill no. 620 vests trial courts with discretion to strike or dismiss firearm enhancements, such as the firearm enhancement imposed here, in the interest of justice. (see  12022.53, subd. (h).) the bill took effect on january 1, 2018 and applies retroactively to cases not yet final on that date. (people v. mcdaniels (2018) 22 cal.app.5th 420, 424425; see people v. francis (1969) 71 cal.2d 66, 7576 [effective after the commission of the prohibited act but before final judgment the lesser punishment provided by the new law should be imposed in the absence of an express statement to the contrary by the legislature], italics added.) we have reviewed the record on appeal and are satisfied that no arguable appellate issue exists, as lyn final several years before senate bill no. 620 took effect. therefore, senate bill no. 620 does not apply to him. although his extensive efforts to rehabilitate himself are to be commended, they do not affect this conclusion. we are further satisfied that counsel has fully complied with her responsibilities.
