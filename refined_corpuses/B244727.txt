(a)(1)) within the meaning of the three strikes law (667, subds. (b)-(i), 1170.12, subds. (a)-(d)) and had a prior conviction as described in section 667.5, subdivision (c). at arraignment, the court noted that appellant had a companion misdemeanor driving under the influence case, and two probation violation matters. appellant waived his constitutional rights to a trial and pled no contest to robbery and driving under the influence. the battery charge and the special allegations were dismissed. the trial court imposed the agreed-upon sentence of two years in state prison for robbery, and one year, concurrent, for driving under the influence. appellant filed a timely notice of appeal and a request for a certificate of probable cause. in the latter, appellant stated: i believe my constitutional rights were violated during the proceedings of this court case. i pleaded no contest because i was in fear after being told i would get 10-15 years in jail. i didnt commit a robbery. i shoplifted, and there was a 10 second struggle as i tried to run away after i was caught. i[m] still not clear on what i was charged for entirely. i was given no court paperwork before or after court. im afraid i may have been coerced into another strike and i dont wanna believe i could get 25 years to life for stealing a slice of pizza, what my lawyer told me. i suffer 1 further statutory references are to the penal code. 3from a mental disability. the trial court denied the request for a certificate of probable cause. after examination of the record, appellants counsel filed an opening brief pursuant to people v. wende (1979) 25 cal.3d 436, and requested that this court conduct an independent review of the entire appellate record to determine whether any arguable issues exist. on april 3, 2013, we advised appellant that he had 30 days in which to personally submit any contentions or issues which he wished us to consider. no response has been received to date. because the trial court denied appellants request for a certificate of probable cause, and his appeal is not based upon grounds occurring after entry of the plea or upon a ruling as to the legality of a search or seizure, the judgment of conviction is not appealable. ( 1237.5; cal. rules of court, rule 31(d).) consequently, we must order dismissal. (people v. mendez (1999) 19 cal.4th 1084, 1099 [when a defendant has failed to comply with the requirements of  1237.5 and rule 31(d), the court of appeal generally may not proceed to the merits of the appeal, but must order dismissal.].) 4disposition the appeal is dismissed. not to be published in the official reports kumar, j.* we concur: turner, p. j. kriegler, j. __________________________________ *judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
