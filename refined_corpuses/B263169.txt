(a))1 and her 2003 felony convictions for second-degree commercial burglary ( 459) and possession of a controlled substance (health & saf. code,  11377) redesignated as misdemeanors pursuant to proposition 47 (pen. code,  1170.18, subd. (f)). the trial court granted the application as to the drug conviction, but declined to redesignate the receiving stolen property and second-degree commercial burglary convictions as misdemeanors. on appeal from those denials, we conclude that the court properly denied the application as to the second-degree commercial burglary conviction, but erred in entencing [defendant] would pose an un facts and procedural background in july 2002, defendant possessed a backpack containing check drafts, blank checks, social security cards, cali cards and financial statements belonging to several people who did not authorize her to possess those items. the people charged defendant with five separate felony counts of receiving stolen property. ( 496, subd. (a).) four of those counts pertained to items belonging to defendant entered a plea to the first count t which encompassed a dismissed the remaining counts. and imposed a 90-day jail sentence. in march 2003, defendant possessed methamphetamine. she also walked into a top dollar 99 cent store and an exxon mobil gas station with credit cards belonging to someone else, and used them to purchase $60.53 and $56.13 in merchandise, 1 unless otherwise indicated, all further statutory references are to the penal code. 3 respectively. the people charged her with (1) possessing a controlled substance (health & saf. code,  11377), (2) second-degree commercial burglary (pen. code,  459), and forgery (id.,  484f, subd. (b)) involving the top dollar 99 cent store, (3) second-degree commercial burglary (id.,  459) and forgery (id.,  484f, subd. (b)) involving the exxon mobil gas station, and (4) giving false information to a police officer (id.,  148.9, subd. (a)). defendant entered a plea to possessing a controlled substance and to the second-degree burglary count associated with the exxon mobil gas station purchase. as part of her plea bargain, the court dismissed the remaining counts. defendant also admitted she was in violation of her probation in the earlier case. the court then imposed a prison sentence of 16 months on the drug possession charge, and imposed concurrent sentences of 16 months on the second-degree burglary charge and the probation violation. in 2015, defendant applied to the trial court to have all three convictions redesignated as misdemeanors pursuant to proposition 47 ( 1170.18). the court granted her application as to the controlled substance conviction, but denied it as to the remaining two convictions. with respect to the receiving stolen property conviction, the court check for $1332.50, exceeded the $950 limit that defines the upper limit of misdemeanor receipt of stolen property under proposition 47. with respect to the second-degree been charged as a forgery today rather than a commercial burglary, rendering irrelevant the $950 threshold for felony commercial burglary. defendant timely appeals. discussion proposition 47, the safe neighborhoods and schools act, reduced several felony offenses to misdemeanorsnamely, those set forth in health and safety code sections 11350, 11357 and 11377 and penal code sections 459.5, 473, 476a, 490.2, 496, and 666. ( 1170.18, subd. (a).) as pertinent here, proposition 47 also authorizes persons who have been convicted of those enumerated offenses and who have completed their 4 id.establishing [her] eligibility for resentencing . . . .people v. sherow (2015) 239 cal.app.4th 875, 879.) defendant argues that the trial court erred in denying her application to redesignate her receiving stolen property and second-degree commercial burglary convictions as misdemeanors. to the extent her challenges require us to construe proposition 47, we engage in de novo review (people v. tran (2015) 61 cal.4th 1160, 1166); to the extent we must evaluate her evidentiary showing, we review for substantial evidence (people v. smith (2015) 61 cal.4th 18, 39). i. receiving stolen property conviction proposition 47 amended section 496 to classify, with exceptions not pertinent property of donnetta grays, which consisted of a checblank check. because the value of this property does not exceed $950, defendant appears to be eligible to have this felony redesignated as a misdemeanor. the people resist this conclusion, arguing that the trial court was correct in aggregating the amount of all of stolen property that defendant possessed in her backpack, including the property underlying counts that were dismissed. in people v. harvey (1979) 25 cal.3d 754 (harvey), our supreme court held that oper and unfair to permit the sentencing court to consider any of the facts underlying [a] dismissed count . . . for purposes of aggravating or enhancing a id. at p. 75counany contrary agreement) that [the] defendant will suffer no adverse sentencing consequences by reason of ibid.) courts have subsequently extended this rule to prohibit consideration of dismissed counts when fixing the conditions of probation (people v. martin (2010) 51 cal.4th 75, 81-82 (martin); people v. beagle (2004) 125 cal.app.4th 415, 417-418, 421 (beagle)) and, 5 more relevant here, when deciding whether to recall a third strike sentence under the recently enacted proposition 36 ( 1170.126) (people v. berry (2015) 235 cal.app.4th 1417, 1425). this principle appears to prohibit a trial court from adding up the value of stolen property underlying dismissed counts. the people nevertheless proffer two reasons why harvey, supra, 25 cal.3d 754 does not apply. first, they argue that harvey itself allows a court to consider the conduct underlying a dismissed count if id. at p. 758, italics omitted.) conduct underlying which the defendant entered a plea. (see, e.g., people v. gaskill (1980) 110 cal.app.3d 1, 3-4 [weapons transactionally related to kidnapping, when brandished to facilitate kidnapping]; people v. guevara (1979) 88 cal.app.3d 86, 92-93 [same]; people v. bradford (1995) 38 cal.app.4th 1733, 1739 [loaded shotguns transactionally related to cultivation of marijuana, when used to protect drugs]; cf. martin, supra, 51 cal.4th at pp. 81-82 [two robberies separate in time and place not transactionally related].) howeverender them transactionally related. (see, e.g., people v. berry, supra, 235 cal.app.4th at pp. 1421-1422, 1426 [possession of firearm not transactionally related to simultaneous beagle, supra, 125 cal.app.4th at pp. 417-418, 421-422 [possession of nunchakus and drugs in different parts of house; not transactionally related]; people v. berry (1981) 117 cal.app.3d 184, 197 [possession of gun not transactionally related to possession of vehicle absent .) other be considered in determining her eligibility for relief under proposition 47. (accord, people v. hoffman (2015) 241 cal.app.4th 1304, 1310 [declining to aggregate amounts of checks forged when defendant only pled to one forgery count].) 6 second, the people contend that harvey restrictions on the use of evidence may be waived and that defendant waived those restrictions as part of her plea bargain. the people are correct on the law (see harvey, supra, 25 cal.3d at p. 768 [noting how the facts. defendant did make a so-harvey restitution. this limited waiver did not dispel harvey protections for any and all purposes. because the trial court erred in considering the value of stolen property underlying tconviction was less than $950, defendant is potentially eligible to have this offense redesignated as a misdemeanor. we accordingly remand the matter to the trial court to t.w. v. superior court (2015) 236 cal.app.4th 646, 649 [specifying that remand is appropriate following reversal on eligibility determination].) ii. second-degree commercial burglary conviction proposition 47 also added section 459.5, which creates a new crime of section commercial establishment with intent to commit larceny while that establishment is open during regular business hours, where the value of the property that is taken or intended to ibid., italics added.) because proposition 47 entitles a relief as to her second-degree commercial burglary conviction under section 459 turns on shoplifting. (people v. rivas-colon (2015) 241 cal.app.4th 444, 449 [so holding]; people v. contreras (2015) 237 cal.app.4th 868, 892 [same].) 7 the factual basis for the second-degree commercial burglary to which defendant entered her plea is undisputed: she walked into an exxon mobil gas station and used s this act constitutes theft by false pretenses, not larceny. larceny requires proof that the defendant (1) captured another , (2) carried that property away, and (3) intended to steal and carry that property away. (e.g., people v. gomez (2008) 43 cal.4th 249, 254-255.) by contrast, representation to the owner,e owner,(3) (e.g., people v. wooten (1996) 44 cal.app.4th 1834, 1842.) as our supreme court recently noted, these two forms of theft are analytically distinct. (people v. williams consensual transfer of possession as well as title because defendant entered the exxon mobile gas station with the intent to commit theft by false pretenseswith intent to commit larcenybecause proposition 47 did not modify section 459 as it applies to burglaries premised on the intent to commit other felonies (accord, people v. segura (2015) 239 cal.app.4th 7 requires the -degree commercial burglary conviction shall remain a felony. (accord, people v. gonzales (2015) 242 cal.app.4th 35 [so holding].) 8 disposition property conviction in case no. ka058017 as a misdemeanor, and remand the matter so unreasonablredesignation of the second-degree commercial burglary conviction in case no. ka061048. not to be published in the official reports. ___________________, j. hoffstadt we concur: ___________________, p. j. boren ___________________, j. chavez
