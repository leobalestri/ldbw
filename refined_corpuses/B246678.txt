[n]obody has so they would let you guys go. defendant was also 1 approximately 30 minutes passed between the time gonzalez, salizar, and ruiz were stopped and shots were fired. 4 gonzalez entered into a plea agreement under which he pled to attempted murder, possession of a weapon, and to a gang allegation in exchange for a suspended sentence of 15 years in prison. d. gang expert testimony. players gang had about 10 to 15 active members from the second half of 2009 to the first half of 2010. southside players and florencia 13 are rivals. defendant admitted to being an active member of southside players numerous times. gonzalez, ruiz, and ortiz are ivities range from felony vandalism, thefts, robberies, burglaries, carjacking, home invasion robberies, assaults, attempted murders, murder, weapon violations, drug sales, drug possession, attempted murder on police officers, and murder. a gang member whdoes it to show his loyalty to them and to elevate his status in the gang. ii. procedural background. in connection with the shooting on chestnut, a jury, on october 11, 2012, found defendant not guilty of the attempted murders of rincon and ramirez. but the jury found him guilty of two counts of assault with a semiautomatic firearm (pen. code,  245, subd. (b)).2 the jury found true a gang allegation ( 186.22, subd. (b)(1)(a), (b) & (c)), but it found a personal gun use allegation ( 12022.5, subd. (a)) not true. in connection with the shooting on garden view, the jury found cruz not guilty of six counts of attempted murder of the peace officers. the jury did find him guilty of six counts of assault on peace officers with a semiautomatic firearm ( 245, subd. (d)(2)). the jury found true personal gun use allegations ( 12022.53, subds. (b) & (c)) and a gang allegation ( 186.22, subd. (b)(1)(a), (b) & (c)). 2 all further undesignated statutory references are to the penal code. 5 cruz was sentenced on january 31, 2012. gate chief of police randy davis the chief said that although none of the eight officers were physically injured, they and their families suffered emotional damage. he also spoke of [e]the court to impose the maximum sentence. the trial court selected count 12 as the base term and sentenced cruz to the high term of 9 years, a consecutive 20 years for the gun use enhancement, and a consecutive 10 years for the gang enhancement (39 years). on count 13, the court sentenced him to 2 years 4 months; 6 years 8 months for the gun use enhancement (9 years). on count 14, the court sentenced cruz to the same sentence as on count 13 (9 years). on count 4, the court sentenced cruz to 2 years plus 1 year 8 months for the gang enhancement (3 years 8 months). on count 23, the court sentenced him to two years. the court imposed concurrent terms on counts 15, 16, and 17. his total sentence therefore was 62 years 8 months. discussion i. cruel and unusual punishment. at the time cruz committed the crimes he was 21 years old. based largely on his age and that none of the victims were physically injured, he contends his 62 years 8 months sentence3 constitutes cruel and unusual punishment (u.s. const., 8th amend.; cal. const., art. i,  17 [prohibiting cruel or unusual punishment]).4 we disagree. 3 would have to serve more than 50 years and 85 percent of his sentence ( 667.5, subd. (c)(8), 2933.1) before being eligible for parole. because he was 24 at the time of sentencing, he would be in his mid- before being eligible for parole. 4 the people contend that the issue has been forfeited because cruz did not object to his sentence as cruel and unusual in the trial court. (people v. burgener (2003) 29 people v. jackson (1996) 13 cal.4th 1164, 1231, fn. 17 [claims of constitutional error based on 6 a sentence violates the federal constitutito the severity of the crime.

(carmony, at p. 1076.) to the proportionality of particular sentences have been exceedingly rar (ewing, at p. 21.) unusual in its method, it is so disproportionate to the crime for which it is inflicted that it (in re lynch (1972) 8 cal.3d 410, 424, fn. omitted; see also people v. dillon (1983) 34 cal.3d 441, 478; people v. haller (2009) 174 cal.app.4th 1080, 1092; people v. em, supra, 171 cal.app.4th at p. 972.) in making this determination, we (1) examine the nature of the offense and the offender; (2) compare the punishment with that prescribed for more serious crimes in california; and (3) compare the punishment with that given for the same offense in other jurisdictions. (in re lynch, at pp. 425-427; em, at p. 972.) we consider the seriousness of the crime in the abstract and the totality of the circumstances surrounding its commission, including motive, manner of commission, the extent of the federal and state constitutions are waived in the absence of a constitutional objection in the trial court].) we address the merits. (see, e.g., people v. em (2009) 171 cal.app.4th 964, 971 & fn. 5 [to avoid the inevitable ineffective assistance of counsel claim, appellate courts may address cruel and unusual punishment issue raised on appeal in the absence of an objection in the trial court].) 7 s involvement, the consequences of his acts, and factors such as age, prior criminality, personal characteristics, and state of mind. (people v. felix (2003) 108 cal.app.4th 994, 1000; dillon, at p. 479.) a defendant must overcome a considerable burden to show a sentence is disproportionate to his or her level of culpability, and (em, at p. 972.) defendant analogizes his case to people v. mendez (2010) 188 cal.app.4th 47 (mendez). mendez was 16 at the time he committed the nonhomicide offenses (carjacking, assault with a firearm, second degree robbery with gang and gun enhancements). (id. at p. 50.) he was sentenced to 84 years to life in prison. (ibid.) mendez based his argument that his sentence violated the eighth amendment on graham v. florida, supra, 560 u.s. 48, which held that juveniles who commit nonhomicide offenses may not be sentenced to lwop. although mendez was not technically sentenced to lwop, mendez nonetheless relied on principles stated in graham to find maturity mendez, at p. 63.) even without graham, the court age strong inference his sentence was grossly disproportionate to his crimes and culpability. (id. at pp. 64-67.) mendez is distinguishable from this case. although young at the time he committed the crimes, defendant was 21 and therefore not a juvenile.5 in people v. argeta (2012) 210 cal.app.4th 1478, 1482, the defendant committed a murder a mere 5 the united states supreme court and our california supreme court have issued a line of cases about juvenile offenders: the death penalty may not be imposed on juvenile offenders (roper v. simmons (2005) 543 u.s. 551); lwop may not be imposed on a juvenile who commits a nonhomicide offense (graham v. florida, supra, 560 u.s. 48); mandatory lwop may not be imposed on a juvenile offender (miller v. alabama (2012) ___ u.s. ___ [132 s.ct. 2455]); a de facto lwop sentence may not be imposed on a juvenile nonhomicide offender (people v. caballero (2012) 55 cal.4th 262). 8 five months after his 18th birthday. argeta age made his sentence cruel and/or unusual: sentencing [d]rawing the line at 18 . . . is subject . . . to the objections always raised against categorical rules . . . [, that] is the point where society draws the line for many purposes between childhood and adulthood . . . s(id. at p. 1482.) young age is certainly a factor we consider when determining whether his sentence is grossly disproportionate to his crimes and culpability, that factor does not negate the severity of his crimes. in one evening, he participated in the assaults against ramirez and rincon. not more than an hour later, he attempted to effect the escape of his fellow gang members from police officers by shooting at the officers. none were physically chief of police spoke of the emotional injuries the officers and the department suffered as a result of moreover, despite his youth, defendant was a member of a violent street gang and had two sustained juvenile petitions and an adult criminal history that included misdemeanor petty theft, felony vandalism, misdemeanor sex with a minor, and misdemeanor theft. true, these are not crimes of violence, but they do say something about the offender. (see, e.g., people v. em, supra, 171 cal.app.4th at p. 976 [balancing -related criminal history, and the danger he presented to society, his 50-years-to-life sentence was not disproportionate to the crime].) in addition to his young age, defendant points out the mendez court was troubled codefendant was the only participant in the crime who physically injured a victim. (mendez, supra, 188 cal.app.4th at p. 66.) mendez again is distinguishable. here, ruiz was charged with attempted murder in connection with the shooting on chestnut, but the case was dismissed in exchange for testifying against defendant. gonzalez received a 29-year suspended sentence for pleading guilty to attempted murder, conditioned on his truthful testimony against defendant. at some point, gonzalez will be allowed to 9 withdraw his plea, plead guilty to discharging a firearm and to a gang allegation, and to receive a suspended 15-year prison sentence and a five-year formal probationary term. there is, therefore, no doubt that gonzalez and ruiz received far more lenient treatment than defendant. but they also did not participate in all of specifically, they had nothing to do with the second incident on garden view where defendant assaulted police officers. in fact, gonzalez and ruiz, in addition to the numerous police officers present, were potential victims of defenda although defendant primarily on mendez, he cursorily also argues when one considers, for example, that second degree murderers previously convicted of murder ( 190.05, subd. (a)). but defendant committed crimes against eight separate victims and personally used a firearm in connection with the assaults against the six police officers. his use of a firearm in connection with six of the eight assaults brought him within the ambit of section 12022.53 and its significant sentencing enhancing provisions. (see, e.g., people v. em, supra, 171 cal.app.4th at p. 973 [sentence enhancement of 25 years to life is not disproportionate to a violation of section 12022.53].) r federal proscriptions against cruel and/or unusual punishment. 10 disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports aldrich, j. we concur: klein, p. j. kitching, j.
