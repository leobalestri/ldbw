(pen. code,1  530.5, subd. (a).) the trial court imposed an agreed-upon sentence of two years in state prison. seven months later, defendant filed a petition for resentencing under section 1170.18, which was added by proposition 47. proposition 47 reduced certain felony drug- and theft-related offenses to misdemeanors. section 1170.18, subdivisions (a) and (f) allows offenders whose crimes have been reclassified to petition for resentencing. the trial court held a brief hearing at which a deputy district attorney was present. defendant was not present; nor was he represented by counsel. the trial court denied the petition. the court held, [t]he felony conviction is for an offense that does not qualify under penal code [section] 1170.18[, subdivision] (a) or we affirm the order. ii. factual background because defendant entered a plea and there was no evidentiary hearing, we take the facts from the probation ofpre-conviction report. defendant cashed two checks at a money mart on separate occasions: october 12, 2015 ($240) and october 16, 2015 ($225). both checks were issued from cassandra kwoh. a fraud investigator later told the manager 1 further statutory references are to the penal code except where otherwise noted. 3 that the checks were fraudulent. the manager from kwoh in the past. the manager thought defendant might have made copies of the original deputies she issued one check to defendant in may 2015 for $500. at sentencing, the trial court ordered defendant to pay $1,800 in restitution to kwoh. iii. discussion a. probable cause certificate preliminarily, we address an argument the attorney general briefly raises in a footnotepleaded no contest to the charges well after proposition 47 was enacted, his claims constitute an attack on the validity of the plea itself, requiring a certificate of probable cause. (people v. panizzon (1996) 13 cal.4th 68, 75.) without a certificate of probable cause, the appeal should be dismissed. (people v. johnson (2009) 4we disagree. pursuant to section 1237.5, a defendant must obtain a the rivolous and vexatious appeals from pleas of guilty or no contest, before clerical and judicial people v. buttram (2003) 30 cal.4th 773, 790.) a certificate is not required, however, if the appeal is based g]rounds that arose after entry of the plea and do not affect 4 people v. cuevas (2008) 44 cal.4th 374, 379; people v. french (2008) 43 cal.4th 36, 43.) the crucial issue is whether in substance the defendant is challenging the validity of his or her plea. (people v. cuevas, supra, 44 cal.4th at p. 381; people v. french, supra, 43 cal.4th at p. 44.) defendant does not appeal from a judgment of conviction; he neither seeks to withdraw his plea nor otherwise attack its post-judgment section 1170.18 motion. under these circumstances, he was not required to obtain a probable cause certificate. (see people v. cuevas, supra, 44 cal.4th at pp. 379, 381; people v. french, supra, 43 cal.4th at pp. 43-44.) b. in the trial court, defendant filed a form [d]efendant requests that the felony sentence be recalled and that he/she be resentenced to a misdemeanor pursuant to penal code [section] 1170.18[, subdivisions](a)- he also checked the box stating, [t] defendant did not specify under which of the code sections enumerated in subdivision (a) of section 1170.18 he sought resentencing. on appeal, defendant argues: the trial court erred when it denied his section 1170.18 motion because identity theft is a form of theft; the amounts of the two fraudulent checks totaled less than $951; and his theft of property valued at less than $951 was eligible for resentencing under proposition 47. we review de ty theft is not a reducible theft offense. (people v. bunyard (2017) 9 cal.app.5th 5 1237, 1242; people v. dunn (2016) 248 cal.app.4th 518, 525.) we see no error. defendant was convicted under subdivision (a) of section 530.5. that subdivision statesobtains personal identifying information, as defined in subdivision (b) of [s]ection 530.5, of another person, and uses that information for any unlawful purpose, including to obtain, or attempt to obtain, credit, goods, services, real property, or medical information without the consent of that person, is guilty of a public offense, and upon conviction therefor, shall be punished by a fine, by imprisonment in a county jail not to exceed one year, or by both a fine and imprisonment, or by imprisonment pursuant to subdivision (h) of [s]2 section 530.55, subdivision (b) defines personal identifying information as maiden name, bank account number and similar information. identity theft is not an offense enumerated in section 1170.18 as eligible for reclassification under proposition 47. we petition. (people v. martinez (2018) 4 cal.5th 647, 652.) the supreme court has applied proposition 47 to offenses not 2 the elements o(1) that the person willfully obtain personal identifying information belonging to someone else; (2) that the person use that information for an unlawful purpose; and (3) that the person who uses the personal identifying information does so without the consent of the person whose personal identifying information is (people v. sanders (2018) 22 cal.app.5th 397, 405; accord, calcrim no. 2040.) 6 specified in section 1170.18. (people v. page (2017) 3 cal.5th 1175 [veh. code,  10851]; people v. romanowski (2017) 2 cal.5th 903 [ 484e].) whether [the defendant] is a person serving a sentence for a conviction . . . of a felony . . . who would have been guilty of a misdemeanor under [proposition 47] had [proposition 47] been in .] (people v. martinez, supra, 4 cal.5th at p. 652.) 1. petty theft: section 490.2 in his briefs on appeal, defendant repeatedly argues his offense was a form of theft. defendant cites section 490.2, an enumerated statute added by proposition 47. section 490.2 redefines grand and petty theft offenses and provides, [n]otwithstanding [s]ection 487 [defining grand theft], or any other provision of law defining grand theft, obtaining property by theft where the value of the money, labor, real or personal property taken does not exceed nine hundred fifty dollars ($950) shall be considered petty theft and shall be punished as a the supreme court has applied section 490.2 to theft offenses. (see people v. romanowski, supra, 2 cal.5th at p. 908 [violation of section 484e, subd. (d), theft of access card information, is statutorily defined as grand theft and therefore falls within scope of section 490.2]; people v. page, supra, 3 cal.5th at pp. 1183, 1187 [section 490.2 extends to vehicle theft, in violation of veh. code,  10851].) with respect to identity theft, however, the courts of appeal have held a violation of section 530.5 is not a theft offense 7 falling under section 490.2. (people v. sanders (2018) 22 cal.app.5th 397, 478-483 [ 530.5, subd. (a)]; people v. liu (2018) 21 cal.app.5th 143, 150-153 [ 530.5, subd. (c)(3); rev. denied april 10, 2018]; see also people v. truong (2017) 10 cal.app.5th 551, 561 [in dual conviction context ( 496), identity theft under section 530.5, subd. (c)(3) is not a theft offense; rev. denied july 12, 2017].) the legislature did not categorize section 530.5 as a theft offense and did not include it among the offenses listed in title 13, chapter 5 o[l]it is instead defined in title 13, c[f]alse [p]ersonation and [c] it is thus unlike section 484e, which defines acquisition or possession of access card account information as people v. truong, supra, 10 cal.app.5th at p. [t]he gravamen of the section 530.5, subdivision (a) offense is the unlawf(people v. sanders, supra, 22 cal.app.5th at p. 400.) identity theft is also distinguishable from theft offenses because the potential harm to victims flowing from the use of personal identifying information far exceeds the value of any actual property obtained by the misuse of the information. (people v. valenzuela (2012) 205 cal.app.4th 800, 808, quoting sen. com. on public safety, analysis of assem. bill no. 2886 (2005-2006 reg. sess.) as amended may 26, 2006, pp. o-its plain terms, section 530.5 addresses harms much broader people v. liu, supra, 21 cal.app.5th at p. 152.)3 3 a footnote in people v. liu, supra, 21 cal.app.5th 143 merits a brief discussion. the defendant in liu was convicted 8 crime, not simply a form of grand theft. [] . . . grand theft is typically a discrete event, not a crime that creates ripples of harm to the victim that flow from the initial misappropriation.(people v. valenzuela, supra, 205 cal.app.4th at p. 808, quoting sen. com. on public safety, analysis of assem. bill no. 2886, supra, at pp. o-p.) forgery is consistent with the conclusion that identity theft is a more serious crime and one the legislature did not view as reducible. as amended by proposition 47, section 473, subdivision (b) defines forgery relating to a check where the value does not exceed $950 as a misdemeanor. the subdivision is inapplicable, however, to a person who is convicted of both forgery and identity theft. ( 473, subd. (b).) additionally, applying section 1170.18 to section 530.5 to nonviolent crimes like petty theft and drug possession, unless the defendant has prior convictions for specified violent or serious under subdivision (c) of section 530.5, which makes it a crime to acquire or retain personal identifying information with an intent to defraud. unlike subdivision (a), under which this defendant was convicted, subdivision (c) does not require use of the information without consent. in liu at page 152 and footnote 3, the court in dictum distinguished the subdivisions (a) and (c) violations with respect to the without consent element. we do not read the liu footnote as suggesting the without consent element of subdivision (a) of section 530.5, under which defendant was convicted, makes it more like a theft offense than that described in subdivision (c). 9 (nov. 4, 2014) text of prop. 47,  purpose, and given the serious harm posed by identity theft, the electorate could reasonably conclude that unlike petty theft, identity theft is a serious crime worthy of felony status. (cf. people v. martinez, supra, 4 cal.5th at p. 654 reasonably could have understood that drug possession and drug transportation crimes are distinct and merit different treatment therefore, section 490.2 does not 2. shoplifting: section 459.5 defendant also cites section 459.5, which was added by proposition 47 and defines the new offense of shoplifting. section 459.5 addresses conduct that previously would have qualified as burglary.4 defendant has not explained, however, how he would 4 sect[s]ection 459 [defining burglary], shoplifting is defined as entering a commercial establishment with intent to commit larceny while that establishment is open during regular business hours, where the value of the property that is taken or intended to be taken does not exceed nine hundred fifty dollars ($950). any other entry into a commercial establishment with intent to commit larceny is burglary. shoplifting shall be punished as a misdemeanor, except [when a person has specified prior convictions]. . . . [] (b) any act of shoplifting as defined in subdivision (a) shall be charged as shoplifting. no person who is charged with shoplifting may also be charged with burglary or 10 have been guilty of misdemeanor shoplifting under proposition 47 had proposition 47 been in effect when he committed the identity theft. ( 1170.18, subd. (a); people v. martinez, supra, 4 cal.5th at p. 652.) he cites section 459.5 without analysis or argument. he does not cite any case discussing section 459.5 in relation to a conviction, as here, of identity theftpertinent analysis or argument does not warrant further discussion.
