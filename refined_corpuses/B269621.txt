a 1990 conviction for attempted robbery; and a 1991 conviction, again for assault with a deadly weapon. in february 1995, a jury convicted ellis of the injury to his girlfriend. the trial court sentenced ellis to 25 years to life in about november 2012, ellis (self-represented) filed a petition to recall his sentence under penal code section 1170.126, the three strikes reform act of 2012. somehow, ellis learned he was entitled to counsel, and the los angeles county alternate public defender entered an appearance on his behalf. in january 2013, ellisy filed an amended petition for recall of sentence. ellis asserted release of petitioner will pose [an] unreasonable risk of danger to the superior court issued an order to show cause. in september 2013, the people filed an petition. ellis filed an informal reply in may 2014. 1 all statutory references are to the penal code. 3 in july 2015, the superior court held a hearing on the petition. the people marked 23 exhibits and the court admitted them into evidence without objection. ellis marked 11 exhibits; the court admitted them into evidence as well. ellis also called two witnesses: richard subia and hy malinek. subia testified he had worked for nearly 27 years in corrections in california. when subia retired in 2012, he was the acting director responsible for the operation and management of all adult correctional institutions in california as well as 500 california offenders housed in other states. while at the california department of corrections and rehabilitation (cdcr), subia had been involved in conducting disciplinary hearings for inmates. and what it means. the lowest score an inmate serving a life sentence can earn is 36 regardless of his good behavior. subia testified that, in his opinion, ellis does not [pose] an unreasonable risk of dangerousness to public safety. subia provided some details about the discipline cdcr had imposed on ellis during his first decade in prison, from 1995 to 2005. subia explained that in about 2005 ellis asked to be placed in special housing called the special needs yard (sny). subia noted ellis had not been disciplined since he moved to sny. subia said the last classification score he had seen for ellis was 91 poight have come down to about 83 in the two years since. subia testified ellis had a transition plan if he were to be released: in a letter dated july 2014 the amity foundation had accepted him. on cross-examination subia admitted that ellis had been sent to the security housing unit at pelican bay at one point and that, upon admission to the prison system, his classification score 4 had been 95. when asked if ellis had participated in any self-help or improvement programs while in prison, subia said ellis had worked in the prison laundry and dining hall; this work qualified as rehabilitative. subia stated ellis had been on a waiting list for programs but was not able to get placed, probably because of his classification score and his housing in somewhere between maximum and medium security. been reduced from close custody to medium custody.) subia admitted ellis seemed not to have worked at any prison job since 2005, nor had he attended any alcoholics anonymous or narcotics anonymous meetings. subia testified he had asked ellis about his 1994 crime against his girlfriend. ellis replied the responding officer accepted his girlfrialtercation and then lied on the witness stand about what he had seen when he arrived. prison records, interviewed him, gave him some tests, and conducted a risk assessment. maoverall risk that [ellis] would engage in unmanageable risk to malinek said he had used a risk assessment tool score had been 29. according to malinthat [ellis] falls into a higher risk category admitted that score was inconsistent with his opinion that ellis malinek explained that the ls/cmi tool estimates recidivism based on the commission of any crimenot just a felony or violent offenseand that it did not take into account the effect of age. malinek noted that ellis was 5 29 when he went to prison; at the time of the july 2015 hearing, ellis was 51. the court took the matter under submission. on august 21, 2015, the court issued its twenty-page memorandum decision began when he was arrested for burglary at age 14. ellis was sent to the california youth authority (cya) in about 1980 for grand theft from a person. within four months of his parole at age 17, ellis was returned to cya on a parole violation. in 1983, less than a month after again being released on parole, ellis was arrested for, and convicted of, misdemeanor battery on a public transit agent. in 1984 ellis again was returned to cya on a parole violation. two months after his parole in 1985, ellis was arrested for attempted murder. he was convicted of assault with a deadly weapon or with force likely to cause great bodily injury. ellis was placed on probation, which he violated repeatedly. in april 1990 ellis was arrested for robbery. armed with a starter pistol, ellis and a companion had tried to grab clothing from the victim. ellis said he had been drinking. he was convicted and sentenced to 16 months in prison. in 1991, while on parole, ellis was arrested for and convicted of assault with a deadly weapon, a beer bottle. again, ellis claimed to have been under the influence of alcohol. ellis was sentenced to two years in prison. he violated his parole in 1992 and 1993. in 1994, he was arrested for the corporal injury to his girlfriend. on that occasion as well, ellis said he had been drinking. m of decision detailed had not worked in any prison job since 2005, nor had he participated in any self-help or rehabilitative programming. 6 after summarizing the testimony of subia and malinek, the court has not spent a single year of his life outside of the supervision of prison, jail, parole, or probation. his extensive criminal history and commitment of violent offenses is further marked by his alcohol addiction. while a history of recidivism alone is an poses an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety, the multiplicity of prior convictions and the failure to comply with conditions of intervening periods of probation or parole give rise engage in any self-help or rehabilitative programming the court noted ellis had not received any treatment for his alcohol problem, a problem that ellis himself repeatedly had said contributed to his crimes. this failure, the court said, adds as been unable to develop the tools necessary to avoid alcohol use if while acknowledging ellis has had no disciplinary proceedings since 2005, the court also found forts to work through the internal factors that have caused him to act out with violence and aggression, and to violate the rights of others since he was 14-years- failed to exhibit remorse or accept responsibility for much of his the people had met their burden of proving, by a preponderance unreasonable risk of danger to public safety at this time due to his criminal history, prison misconduct, insufficient rehabilitative 7 petition to be resentenced to a second strike sentence. ellis filed a timely notice of appeal. (see teal v. superior court (2014) 60 cal.4th 595.) ellis makes three arguments. first, he contends the superior court used the wrong legal standard in ruling on his petition. it should, he says, have applied the definition of proposition 47. ( 1170.18, subd. (c).) second, ellis asserts the court should have presumed him suitable for release unless the people proved beyond a reasonable doubt that he continues to be dangerous. third, ellis argues the evidence did not support the unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. we discuss, and reject, each argument in turn. discussion 1. proposition 36, the three strikes reform act of 2012 in november 2012, california voters enacted proposition 36, the three strikes reform act. with some exceptions, three strikes law to reduce conviction is not serious or violent. (people v. valencia (2017) 3 cal.5th 347, 350 (valencia).) it also enacted a procedure governing inmates sentenced under the former three strikes law whose third strike was neither serious nor violent, permitting them to petition for resentencing in accordance with proposition  1170.126, subd. resentencing provisions provide, however, that an inmate will be 8 denthat resentencing the petitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.

(f).)valencia, supra, 3 cal.5th at p. 350.) proposition 36 did not define the ibid.) we review a denial of resentencing based on dangerousness under a mixed standard. we review the facts and evidence on which the court based its finding of unreasonable risk for substantial evidence. (people v. frierson (2017) 4 cal.5th 225, 239 (frierson); people v. losa (2014) 232 cal.app.4th 789, 791.) the defendant presents an dis (losa, at p. 791.) 2. danger to public safetyresentencing proceedings under proposition 36 ellis first argues the superior court should have applied the definitiforth in proposition 47, which the voters approved in november 2014. the parties filed their briefs in this case in 2016. since then, our supreme court has clarified the governing law on this issue. in valencia, supra, 3 cal.5th 347, the court held that proposition 47 did not amend the three strikes reform act. resentencing, the court has broad discretion to consider: (1) the criminal conviction history, including the type of crimes committed, the extent of injury to victims, the length of prior incarcer9 discretion, determines to be relevant in deciding whether a new sentence would result in an unreasonable risk of danger to public id. at p. 354.) the court stated that, in contrast to this broad discretion under proposition 36, to public id. at p. 355.) the court also noted id. at pp. 354355 [citing people v. garcia (2014) 230 cal.app.4th 763, 769770; people v. flores (2014) 227 cal.app.4th 1070, 1075].) 3. ellis next argues the superior court should have required the people to prove that his release would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety beyond a reasonable doubt. ellis acknowledges that people v. superior court (kaulick) (2013) 215 cal.app.4th 1279 (kaulick) held that a preponderance of the evidence is the correct standard. (id. at pp. 13011305 [citing dillon v. united states (2010) 560 u.s. 817].) our supreme court recently reiterated that in suitability proceedings addressed to dangerousness. in frierson, supra, 4 cal.5th 225ineligibility for resentencing beyond a reasonable doubt. frierson had been convicted of stalkingneither a serious nor a violent felony. he petitioned under proposition 36 for resentencing. the people argued frierson was not eligible for resentencing because the record showed he intended to cause great bodily injury during 10 the commission of the crime. the trial court applied a petition. (idthe supreme court held this was error. (id. at p. 240.) the court noted the different burdens of proof for ineligibility determinations and unsuitability determinations. efendant poses an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety is discretionary ( 1170.126, subd. (f)), and several courts of appeal have of unreasonable risk is based must be proven by the people by a preponderance of the evidence . . . and are themselves subject to [appellate] review for substantial evidence.
