(people v. arriaga (2014) 58 cal.4th 950, 963; people v. martinez (2013) 57 cal.4th 555, 562, 565.) the accused must prove it was reasonably probable he or she would not have entered a guilty, no contest or nolo contendere if properly advised. (martinez, at pp. 562, 565; accord, people v. superior court (zamudio) (2000) 23 cal.4th 183, 210 (zamudio).) our supreme court has explained: testimony stating that he or she would not have entered into the plea bargain if properly advised. it is up to the trial on is credible, and the court may reject an assertion that is not supported by an explanation or other corroborating (martinez, at p. 565; see in re resendiz (2001) 25 cal.4th 230, 253s self-serving statement not sufficient to show prejudice]; in re alvernaz (1992) 2 cal.4th 924, 938 [prejudice must be corroborated independently by objective evidence].) to vacate the judgment for an abuse of discretion. (arendtsz, supra, 247 cal.app.4th at p. 617; see zamudio, supra, 23 cal.4th at p. 192.) under the abuse of discretion standard, 7 (people v. jackson (2005) 128 cal.app.4th 1009, 1018.) a trial courts exercise of discretion will not be disturbed on appeal unless the court exercised it in an arbitrary, capricious, or patently absurd manner resulting in a manifest miscarriage of justice. (baltayan v. estate of getemyan (2001) 90 cal.app.4th 1427, 1434.) is often s exercise of discretion will be reversed (horsford v. board of trustees of california state university (2005) 132 cal.app.4th 359, 393.) ii. the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion on appeal, naldi were not adequate because they did not track the language of section 1016.5, subdivision (a) verbatim. specifically, naldi contends the advisements were inadequate because may have the consequences pursuant to the laws of the united states. it is firmly established that he advisement need not be in the exact language of section 1016.5people v. araujo (2016) 243 cal.app.4th 759, 762.) [o]nly substantial compliance is required under section 1016.5 as long as the defendant is specifically advised of all three separate immigration people v. gutierrez (2003) 106 8 cal.app.4th 169, 174, italics added; araujo, at p. 762 [same]; see generally, zamudio, supra, 23 cal.4th at pp. 207208.) here, naldi was advised in writing of all three potential consequences (deportation, exclusion from admission to the united states, and denial of naturalization). proper substitute for verbal admonishment by the trial (people v. ramirez (1999) 71 cal.app.4th 519, 521; see people v. gutierrez, supra, 106 cal.app.4th at p. 175 [court may rely on executed form]; people v. quesada (1991) 230 cal.app.3d 525, 533534 [statutory admonition need not be given orally].) in addition, both naldi and her attorney affirmed at the time of her plea that she was advised of the potential immigration consequences of her plea, she understood those consequences and had no questions about them. even if there was some merit to her claim about the nonsubstantial compliance with section 1016.5, naldi failed to demonstrated any prejudice. her vague, self-serving, and uncorroborated declaration submitted in support of her motion is patently insufficient to establish prejudice.
