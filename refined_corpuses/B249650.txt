[] for you to find a person guilty of these crimes, that person must not only commit the prohibited act, but must do so with wrongful intent. a person acts with wrongful intent when she intentionally does a prohibited act on purpose, however, it is not required that she intend to break the law. the act required is explained in the instruction for that assault with a deadly weapon in violation of penal code section 245[, subdivision (a)(1)]. 5 instruction on accident as a defense. mr. tripp argued in connection with the instruction on accidentmr. byrd, it seems that there is some evidence that ms. de la cruz might have accidentally stabbed [mr. rodriguez] in the face, apparently, through his gestures he showed that he the - - in element one, the defendant did an act that by its nature would directly and probably result in the application of force.

(people v. anderson (2011) 51 cal.4th 989, 996; see people v. villanueva (2008) 169 cal.app.4th 41, 53.) as applicable to a general intent crime, calcrim no. 3404 explains: s not guilty of [assault with a deadly weapon] if (he or she) acted . . . without the intent required for that crime, but acted instead accidentally. you may not find the defendant guilty of [assault with a deadly weapon] unless you are convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that (he or she) acted with the required people v. anderson, supra, 51 cal.4th at p. 996.) the trial court was not required to instruct with calcrim no. 3404 absent substantial evidence supporting it. (people v. hartsch (2010) 49 cal.4th 472, 500; people v. bolden (2002) 29 cal.4th 515, 558.) well settled that a defendant has a right to have the trial court . . . give a jury instruction on any affirmative defense for which the record contains substantial evidence [citation]evidence sufficient for a reasonable jury to find in favor of the defendant [citation]determining whether the evidence is sufficient to warrant a jury instruction, the trial court 7 evidence which, if believed by the jury, was sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt . . . [citations.]people v. salas (2006) 37 cal.4th 967, 982-983; accord, people v. mentch (2008) 45 cal.4th 274, 288.) on appeal, defendant asserts substantial evidence supported an accident incident, and appeared to be under the influence of some type of intoxicant. [defendant] also had behaved in this manner on the days preceding the accident. she had directed her invectives at various passersby, and hurled a few items, but not at [mr.] rodriguez. there was evidence [defendant] was unaware of [mr. rodriguezstabbing. [defendant] was digging through the contents of a shopping cart that did not belong to her. finding a knife, she pulled it out of the cart, swinging it backwards for no bit of evidence the [trial] court overlooked was officer a: of, relating to, characterized by, or affected with or as if with spasm <a spastic ibid.evidence showed [defendant] was suffering from ongoing involuntary and abnormal muscular contractions. [] this testimony is consistent with and supportive of the view and abnormal muscular contractions. this view of the evidence could reasonably explain why [defendant] would make what appeared to be an aggressive and unjustified physical assault for no apparent reason. while she had been vocally abusing others in the days preceding the incident, there was no evidence suggesting she had touched anyone or possessed any type of weapon. at the time of the incident, she was rummaging through 8 and then jerked to the rear. in short, there was substantial evidence supporting the defense of accident there was no substantial evidence defendant swung the knife accidentally. there was no evidence defendant was rummaging in the shopping cart and pulled out the knife. instead, the evidence was that as mr. rodriguez passed behind her, defendant reached into the cart and pulled out the knife. further, defendant had been walking back and forth along the sidewalk yelling at people for several previous days. prior to the assault, defendant was angry. she was throwing things at passing cars. moreover, even if defendant stabbed mr. rodriguez by accident, she pulled the knife from the shopping cart and swung it in his presence. following the attack, defendant walked away and tossed the knife into a trash can. in the days preceding the stabbing, mr. byrd had seen defendant walking back and forth in the street yelling at people. a reasonable person knowing what defendant knew would realize that swinging a knife in such circumstances would directly, naturally and probably result in a battery. the prosecutor was not required to prove defendant was subjectively aware of the risk that an injury might occur. (people v. wyatt, supra, 48 cal.4th at p. 781; people v. williams, supra, 26 cal.4th at pp. 788, 790.) fidgety. but he attributed her condition to drug use. there was no evidence that defendant suffered from involuntary, abnormal muscle contractions that could have caused her to accidentally swing her arm back. our supreme court has not yet determined the test of prejudice applicable to a failure to instruct on an affirmative defense. (people v. salas, supra, 37 cal.4th at p. 984; people v. williams (2009) 176 cal.app.4th 1521, 1530.) but even if the trial court had erred, we would hold any error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. (chapman v. california (1967) 386 u.s. 18, 24; people v. flood (1998) 18 cal.4th 470, 502-503 [failure to instruct on an element, raising an improper presumption or directing a verdict or finding subject to chapman review for prejudice].) mr. tripp never argued to the jury 9 that defendant swung the knife accidentally as a result of an involuntary muscle contraction. further, the jury was instructed with calcrim no. 252, concurrence of act and general criminal intent, and calcrim no. 875, defining assault and deadly weapon assault. as instructed, and in finding defendant guilty, the jury necessary concluded she intended to swing the knife. b. presentence custody credit defendant was arrested on january 9, 2012. she was declared mentally incompetent to stand trial on july 13, 2012. defendant was transferred from the county jail to patton state hospital on october 1, 2012. a section 1370, subdivision (a) court report dated december 19, 2012 was prepared. in that report, a licensed clinical social worker and staff psychiatrist recommended defendant be returned to court as competent to stand trial pursuant to section 1372, subdivision (a). an undated certificate of mental competence was issued. the parties agree, however, that the undated certificate was issued on december 19, 2012. defendant was not returned to the county jail until january 7, 2013. defendant was sentenced on may presentence custody and conduct credit award exceeded the length of her two-year sentence, she was released. the trial court awarded defendant 401 days of presentence custody credit, 400 days of conduct credit, and 98 days of credit for time spent at patton state hospital. the parties agree that defendant remained at the state hospital for 19 days after she was found competent to stand trial. between december 19, 2012, and january 7, 2013, the authorities simply delayed returning defendant to the county jail. defendant was entitled to presentence custody credit for all days of confinement in the county jail and in the state hospital. ( 1375.5; people v. mendez (2007) 151 cal.app.4th 861, 864-865.) defendant was in custody for 498 days, from her arrest on january 9, 2012, through her sentencing on may 20, 2013. defendant was not entitled to conduct credit from october 1, 2012, when she was transferred to patton state hospital, to december 19, 2012, when 10 she was certified competent to stand trial. (people v. bryant (2009) 174 cal.app.4th 175, 177, 182-184.) therefore, defendant should have received 498 days of presentence custody credit and 418 days of conduct credit. the question of credits is not moot as applied to a defendant released on parole.

(b)) and a $280 parole revocation restitution fine ( 1202.45) violated ex post facto principles. the imposition of restitution fines constitutes punishment and is thus subject to the ex post facto clauses of the state and federal constitutions. (people v. souza (2012) 54 cal.4th 90, 143; people v. avila (2009) 46 cal.4th 680, 729.) defendant committed the present crime on january 9, 2012, and was sentenced on may 13, 2013. when defendant committed the present crime, former section 1202.4, subdivision (b) authorized a restitution fine set discretion in an amount between $240 and $10,000. (stats. 2011, ch. 358,  1.) the section 1202.45 parole revocation restitution fine is to be in the same amount as that imposed pursuant to section 1202.4, subdivision (b).

(evid. code,  664; in re jacob j. (2005) 130 cal.app.4th 429, 437-438, disapproved on another point in in re julian r.
