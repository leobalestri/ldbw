fraudulent possession of personal identifying information in violation of penal code section 530.5, subdivisions (a) and (c)(2),1 and offering a false or forged instrument in violation of section 115, subdivision (a). following the enactment of proposition 47, mountford filed petitions for resentencing, claiming that his convictions were eligible for reduction to misdemeanors. the trial court denied the petitions, finding the convictions ineligible for resentencing.2 on appeal, mountford contends that the trial court erred because his offenses should be treated the same as the theft offenses enumeratoffenses are ineligible for resentencing under proposition 47.3 background i. conviction (no. b286803) 1 all further statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise indicated. 2 we consider the appeals from the denial of both petitions together, because both involve the same issues. 3 as we discuss below, the issue as to whether a felony conviction for identity theft under section 530.5, subdivision (a), can be reclassified as a misdemeanor under proposition 47 is currently pending before the california supreme court. 3 on june 10, 2009, mountford was an inmate at the los and was being held in a cell with inmate john bettancourt. heard bettancourt yell that mountford wwhen the deputies went to investigate, they found the two inmates arguing. bettancourt said that mountford had looked at bdocuments that contained his drse and social security numbersand had written down rmation on a piece of paper. bettancourt also said that mountford had flushed that piece of paper in the toilet. thand found several pieces of paper with handwritten notes. one piece of paper was a bookinprior aanother piece of paper contained instructions on acquiring a fraudulent bank account in another another bore a number that appeared to be a debit or credit card number. deputies also discovered three pieces of a paper that contained information on other inmates. the first piece of paper had the birth dated social security number of inmate john bowlin. the second piece of paper was a booking sheet with handwritten notes reflecting the birth date and social security number of inmate michael eiring. the third piece of paper had handwritten notes regarding the booking number and address of former inmate miguel mancia. bowlin told the deputies that he did not know mountford and had not given him his personal information. eiring said that he had given mountford his personal information because mountford had promised him a job once he was released from jail. 4 on october 30, 2009, the people charged mountford with identifying information theft with a prior identity theft conviction, in violation of section 530.5, subdivision (c)(2). the people also alleged that mountford had served four prior prison terms within the meaning of section 667.5, subdivision (b). on february 18, 2010, mountford pleaded no contest to the charged offense, and the trial court dismissed the prior conviction allegations. the court then sentenced mountford to the middle term of two years in state prison. ii. deputies following a vehicle pursuit. inside the vehicle, deputies stamp and signature on it, and a number of forged documentsincluding a quitclaim deedit. when deputies spoke to andreetta, she stated that she did not know mountford and had not quitclaimed her residence to him. she said that her residence had been burglarized and documents may have been taken at that time. she added that she had allowed a friend to stay with her, and the friend may have known mountford. deputies also spoke to greer, who stated that the signature on the blank quitclaim deed was not hers, and she never notarized the andreetta quitclaim deed. a title search of name.4 4 and forged quitclaim deed. 5 on april 3, 2015, the people filed a felony complaint against mountford, accusing him of procuring and offering a false or forged instrument ( 115, subd. (a); count 1), two counts of identity theft ( 530.5, subd. (a); counts 2 & 4), and two counts of forgery ( 470, subd. (a); counts 3 & 5). the complaint alleged seven prior felony convictions within the meaning of section 667.5, subdivision (b). on july 2, 2015, mountford pleaded no contest on counts 1 and 2 in exchange for 16-month concurrent sentences on the two counts. at the august 3, 2015 sentencing hearing, mountford agreed to make restitution to andreetta in the amount of $4,184.04. the trial court sentenced him to the low term of 16 months on the two counts and dismissed the remaining counts pursuant to the plea agreement. iii. on october 16, 2017, mountford petitioned for resentencing pursuant to proposition 47 as to both cases. in the first petition, he sought to reduce the february 28, 2010 conviction to a misdemeanor. in the second, he sought to reduce the august 3, (although he was not convicted on  470 forgery charges but for offering a false or forged instrument in violation of  115). on october 27, 2017, mountford filed a motion to reduce a charge to a misdemeanor pursuant to proposition 47 as to the august 3, 2015 section 530.5 conviction. underneath the section proposition 47 petition as to the section 530.5 conviction. at the november 16, 2017 hearing on the petitions, the people objected to granting the petitions. the trial court denied 6 the petitions on the ground the identity theft convictions were not eligible for proposition 47 relief. mountford timely appealed as to both petitions. discussion i. relevant section 530.5 provisions very person who willfully obtains personal identifying information . . . of another person, and uses that information for any unlawful purpose, including to obtain, or attempt to obtain, credit, goods, services, real property, or medical information without the consent of that person, is guilty of a public offense . . . subdivision, the defendant shall be punished by a fine, by imprisonment in a county jail not to exceed one year, or by both a fine and imprisonment, or by imprisonment pursuant to subdivision (h) of section 1170.

(people v. rivera (2015) 233 cal.app.4th 1085, 1091.) to that end, proposition 47 created the new crime of shoplifting, which is defined as entering a commercial establishment during regular business h of property worth $950 or less. (people v. gonzales, supra, 2 cal.5th at p. 862; see  459.5, subd.

(see people v. jimenez (2018) 22 cal.app.5th 1282, 1292-1293 [conviction for unauthorized use of personal identifying information was properly reduced to misdemeanor shoplifting], review granted july 25, 2018, s249397 (jimenez); people v. sanders (2018) 22 cal.app.5th 397, 400 [unauthorized use of personal identifying information is not a theft offense and should not be considered as petty theft or reduced to misdemeanor], review granted july 25, 2018, s248775 (sanders).)7 the people urge us to follow sanders, as well as people v. liu (2018) 21 cal.app.5th 143, review granted june 13, 2018, s248130 (liu).8 conversely, 7 according to the california supreme court, jimenez presents the following issue: unauthorized use of personal identifying information of another (pen. code,  530.5, subd. (a)) be reclassified as a misdemeanor under proposition 47 on the ground that the offense amounted to penal code section 459.5 on november 15, 2018. the court deferred briefing in sanders pending its decision in jimenez. 8 according to the california supreme court, liu presents the following issue: conviction for theft of access card information in violation of penal code section 484e, subdivision (d), is eligible to be reduced to a misdemeanor under proposition 47 when the information has been used to obtain property, is the value of the access card information limited to the fair market value of the information itself on the black market or can the value of the property obtained by the use of the information be considered? (see people v. romanowski (2017) the case was fully briefed on january 7, 2019. 10 mountford argues that jimenez, as well as people v. romanowski, supra, 2 cal.5th 903 (romanowski), are the better cases to follow. a. sanders and liu in sanders, supra, 22 cal.app.5th 397, the defendant used a credit card she found on the ground to buy cigarettes and a beverage at a convenience store and to get cash at a fast food restaurant. the total amount of charges made by the defendant on the credit card were $174.61. the defendant pleaded guilty to two counts of commercial burglary ( 459) and two counts of identity theft ( 530.5, subd. (a)). the defendant subsequently filed a petition under proposition 47 to reclassify all of her convictions as misdemeanors and to dismiss the identity theft counts. the trial court granted the petition as to the burglary offenses under section 459.5, but denied the petition with regard to the violations of section 530.5. on appeal, the defendant argued that since the burglary charges had been reclassified as misdemeanor shoplifting and the amount of goods taken from the merchants was under $950, the section 530.5 violations must be considered as petty thefts and thus reduced to misdemeanors and dismissed. (sanders, supra, at pp. 399-400.) the fourth district dentity theft is not actually a theft offenserather it seeks to protect the victim from the misuse of his or her identity.(sanders, supra, 22 cal.app.5th at p. 405.) thus, the court held, theft as it relates to the cardholder. it was an unlawful use, one of several unlawful uses set forth in the statute. to the extent there was a theft . . . , it was against the property interest of the 11 merchants w presentation (ibid.) consequently, while the defendant was entitled to have her commercial burglary offense reclassified as shoplifting, she was not entitled to have her nontheft section 530.5 offenses reclassified under proposition 47. (sanders, supra, at p. 406.) in liu, supra, 21 cal.app.5th 143, division eight of this court held that a conviction of identity theft in violation of section 530.5 is not eligible for resentencing under proposition 47. the defendant had been convicted of 22 theft-related counts arising from her scam of offering loan services to immigrants. (id. at p. 146.) of specific relevance here, the jury convicted the defendant of violating section 530.5, subdivision (c)(3), the fraudulent acquisition and retention of the personal identifying information of 10 or more people.9 the trial court denied the petition for resentencing on that count. the court of appeal affirmed. (liu, supra, at p. 146.) the liu court first framed the issue: .2, 10 (liu, supra, 21 cal.app.5th at p. 150.) the 9 section 530.5, subdivision (c)(3), provides: every person who, with the intent to defraud, acquires or retains possession of the personal identifying information . . . of 10 or more other persons is guilty of a public offense, and upon conviction therefor, shall be punished by a fine, by imprisonment in a county jail not to exceed one year, or by both a fine and imprisonment, or by imprisonment pur 10 section 490.2 addresses petty theft and provides that obtaining any property by theft where the value of the money, 12 court noted that while access card information as grand theftsection 530.5 does not define its crimes as grand theft, but [instead] describes them as id. at p. 151.) therefore, the court noted, (id. at p. 152.) the court concluded: proposition 47, given the far-reaching effects of the misuse of a (id. at p. 153.) indeed, although the crime is commonly referred to as is the unlawsanders, supra, 22 cal.app.5th at p. 400.) to that end, the california legislature did not categorize section 530.5 as a theft offense and did not include it among the offenses listed in title 13, chapter 5 of the instead included in title 13, chapter 8 of the penal code (see people v. truong (2017) 10 cal.app.5th 551, 561 [violation of identity theft is also distinguishable from theft offenses because the potential harm to victims flowing from the use of personal identifying information far exceeds the value of any actual property obtained by the misuse of the infor lives are often severely disrupted. (people v. valenzuela (2012) 205 cal.app.4th 800, 808, quoting sen. com. on public safety, analysis of assem. bill no. 2886 (2005-2006 reg. sess.) as labor, real or personal property taken does not exceed nine hundred fifty dollars ($950) shall be considered petty theft and shall be punished as a misdemeanorone or more specified prior convictions. 13 amended may 26, 2006, pp. o-p.) electronic age is an essentially unique crime, not simply a form of grand theft.

(jimenez, supra, at pp. 1285-1286.) the court of appeal affirmed. relying on romanowski, supra, 2 cal.5th 903, as well as people v. gonzales, supra, 2 cal.5th 858 and people v. garrett (2016) 248 cal.app.4th 82, the court of appeal concluded that the defendantshoplifting offenses under proposition 47. (jimenez, supra, at pp. 1292-1293.)11 11 in people v. garrett, supra, 248 cal.app.4th 82, the defendant entered a store and tried to buy merchandise with a stolen credit card. (id. at p. 84.) after pleading no contest to commercial burglary, the defendant petitioned for resentencing under proposition 47. (id. at p. 86.) the trial court denied the petition, but the sixth district reversed, rejecting the the defendant intended to 14 in romanowski, supra, 2 cal.5th 903, the supreme court held theft of access card information in violation of section 484e, subdivision (d), is not excluded from proposition 47 relief. in so holdingoffense of theft of an access card ( 484e) was enacted in order to protect consumers and thus should be exempt from the petty theft statute ( 490.2) in proposition 47. (id. at pp. 913-914.) the defendant in romanowski pleaded no contest to felony theft of access card information in violation of section 484e, subdivision commit felony identity theft, the shoplifting statute did not apply. (id. at pp. 86-90.) the] defendant intended to commit felony identity theft, he could not have been charged with burglary under . . . section 459 if the same actentering a store with the intent to purchase merchandise with a stolen credit card (id. at p. 88.) based on this reasoning, the court of appeal concluded that use of a stolen credit card to purchase merchandise valued at $950 or less constituted shoplifting under section 459.5. (id. at p. 90.) in people v. gonzales, supra, 2 cal.5th 858, the defendant entered a bank and cashed two checks, each valued at less than $950. (id. at p. 862.) after pleading guilty to second degree burglary, the defendant petitioned for resentencing under proposition 47. the trial court denied his petition and the court of appeal affirmed, but the supreme court reversed. (ibid.) the shoplifting statute apply to an entry to commit a nonlarcenous theft. thus, [the] defendantstolen check for less than $950, traditionally regarded as a theft by false pretenses rather than larceny, now constitutes shoplifting under the statute. [the d]efendant may properly petition for misdemeanor resentencing under . . . section (ibid.) 15 (d), and sought reduction of his sentence pursuant to section 1170.18. (id. at p. 906.) the trial court denied his petition, holding that proposition 47 did not apply to theft of access card information. division eight of this court reversed, holding that theft in violation of section 484e, subdivision (d), was subject to proposition 47 by way of section 490.2, which reduces such a violation to a misdemeanor if it involves property valued at less than $950. (ibid.) the court remanded the case so that the trial court could determine whether the property involved was valued at less than $950. (ibid.) on review, the supreme court affirmed, holding that the theft of access card information as defined in section 484e, subdivision (d), was subject to resentencing under proposition 47. the crime fell within section when the stolen property was wid. at p. 909.) iv. fraudulent possession of personal identifying information in violation of section 530.5, subdivision (c)(2) (no. b286803) although section 530.5, subdivision (c)(2), is not listed in section 1170.18, nor was it amended by proposition 47, mountford argues that his conviction is eligible for redesignation as a misdemeanor under section 490.2.12 (see romanowski, supra, 2 cal.5th at p. 906 [the 12 according to mountford, whether his identity theft is construed as petty theft pursuant to section 490.2, or shoplifting pursuant to section 459.5, his conviction is eligible for resentencing under proposition 47. 16 defendant convicted of violating  484e eligible for misdemeanor resentencing under  490.2]; see also people v. martinez (2018) 4 cal.5th 647, 652 [the defendant convicted of violating health & saf. code,  11379 eligible for misdemeanor resentencing under  490.2]; people v. page (2017) 3 cal.5th 1175, 1184-1186 [the defendant convicted of violating veh. code,  10851 eligible for misdemeanor resentencing under  490.2]; people v. soto (2018) 23 cal.app.5th 813, 822.) we disagree and conclude that, consistent with sanders and liu, mountford is not entitled to have his section 530.5, subdivision (c)(2), offense reclassified as a misdemeanor under proposition 47.13 as noted above, section 530.5 addresses harms much broader than theft (liu, supra, 21 cal.app.5th at p. 152), and section 530.5, subdivision (c), has no requirement that the information be acquired or retained without the consent of its owner, a hallmark requirement of a theft crime (romanowski, supra, 2 cal.5th at p. 912; see also  484, subd. (a)). the statute protect themselves from fraudulent use of their identifying information once it is in the possession of another, because they cannot easily change their name, date of birth, social security people v. valenzuela, supra, 205 cal.app.4th at p. 807.) the harms these victims suffer go well beyond the actual property obtained through the misuse of the persons identity. identity theft victims lives are often severely disrupted 13 in light of the of sanders and liu, we cite these cases for their persuasive rather than precedential value. (see cal. rules of court, rules 8.1105(e)(1)(b), 8.1115(e)(1).) 17 which may be difficult to repair, and even the commission of other crimes by using the victims identity, causing great harm to the victim. id. at p. 808.) given the wide-ranging effects of s personal identifying information, we are not persuaded that section 530.5 within the meaning of proposition 47. neither romanowski nor jimenez compels a different result. in romanowski, the supreme courtfaced with a crime previously classified as grand thefthad to decide whether stealing a particular type of property could constitute petty theft. specifically, the court was tasked with analyzing whether theft of access cards in violation of section 484e was subject to misdemeanor reduction pursuant to section 490.2. (romanowski, supra, 2 cal.5th at p. 908.) the answer thus hinged on whether section 484e was a theft crime. noting first that section 484e was 484e, subd. (d)), the court next observed that . . . chapter 5 of the penal cod romanowski, supra, at p. 908.) based on the statutory definition and chapter placement, the court concluded: legislature made clear that theft of access card information is a ibid.) unlike section 484e, however, section 530.5 is defined as a public offense and contains no references to theft or its hallmarks. moreover, placed in the chapter of the penal code se s marriage by false pretenses ( 528) and falsifying birth certifications and licenses ( liu, supra, 21 cal.app.5th at p. 151.) thus, with regard to misuse of identity, the legislature has used a violation of 18 section 530.5 is not a theft offense. (romanowski, supra, 2 cal.5th at p. 908; see sanders, supra, 22 cal.app.5th at p. 400; people v. truong, supra, 10 cal.app.5th at p. 561.) furthermore, romanowski did not have to determine proposition 47 eligibilit- offense, i.e., one that is not identified as grand theft and requires additional necessary elements beyond the theft itself.people v. soto, supra, 23 cal.app.5th at p. 822.)14 othing in romanowski . . . suggests that section 490.2 extends to any course of conduct that happens to include obtaining property by theft worth less than $950.ibid.) indeed, as noted by soto, a different conclusion would lead to absurd results. for example, robbery is the felonious taking of personal property in the possession of another, from his person or immediate presence, and against his will, accomplished by means of force or fear. theft is a lesser included offense of robbery. if a robber took property worth less than $950, an over-expansive reading of romanowski might construe this crime as petty theft under section 490.2. such a constructs objective to reduce sentences for nonviolent crimes while shifting spending toward more serious offenses. (id. at p. 823.)15 14 - soto was theft from an elder, in violation of section 368, subdivision (d), that occurred when the s birth date and social security number to obtain a line of credit in her name. (people v. soto, supra, 23 cal.app.5th at p. 816.) 15 people v. segura (2015) 239 cal.app.4th 1282 is also illustrative. there, a defendant convicted of conspiracy argued that he was eligible for resentencing because he had conspired with his codefendants to commit a theft. the fourth district 19 in order to find a defendant guilty of violating section 530.5, subdivision (c)(2), the people must prove the defendant acquired or kept the personal identifying information of another person, and did so with the intent to defraud another person, and that the defendant has a prior section 530.5 conviction. (see calcrim no. 2041.) thus, even if we categorized this particular crime as a theft offense, these additional elements -way as robbery or conspiracy to commit theft and place his conviction outside the scope of section 490.2. (see people v. soto, supra, 23 cal.app.5th at p. 824.) in sum, a violation of section 530.5, subdivision (c)(2), is neither defined as a theft offense nor encompasses conduct that entails theft and nothing more. as a result, we conclude the crime does not fall within the scope of section 490.2, subdivision (a), even if the amount obtained is under $950.16 (see soto, supra, at p. 824.) disagreed. applying proposition 47 to theftbut not conspiracy to commit theftdid not lead to an absurd result because (id. at p. 1284.) here, while theft is typically a discrete event, identity theft s of harm to the victim that flow from the initial (people v. valenzuela, supra, 205 cal.app.4th at p. 808.) consequently, this crime presents a greater evil than a common theft offense and deserves different treatment. 16 nor does the crime fall within the scope of section 459.5. in jimenez, the court of appeal held that theft by false pretensesand by analogy section 530.5, subdivision (a)now constitutes shoplifting under section 459.5, subdivision (a). (jimenez, supra, 22 cal.app.5th at p. 1291, citing people v. 20 v. use of personal identifying information in violation of section 530.5, subdivision (a), and offering a false or forged instrument in violation of section 115 (no. b287202) for the reasons set forth above, we conclude that information in violation of section 530.5, subdivision (a), was not an offense within the scope of proposition 47. therefore, mountford was not eligible for resentencing on that count. forged instrument in violation of section 115, mountford contends he is eligible for resentencing on that count, and the trial court gonzales, supra, 2 cal.5th at p. 876.) the court of appeal they both entered a commercial establishment during business hours for the purpose of cashing (jimenez, supra, at p. 1289, citing gonzales, supra, at pp. 862, 868-869.) here, d conduct. furthermore, gonzales established that a charged violation of section 459, second degree burglary, based upon a theory that the defendant entered with the intent to cash a stolen check, would be shoplifting under proposition 47. (see gonzales, supra, at p. 862.) but mountford was not charged with burglary or theft. he was charged with and convicted only of acquiring and retaining possession of personal identifying information of another person with the intent to defraud. ineligible for reduction under proposition 47, there is no need for an evidentiary hearing to determine whether the value of the property associated with his offense was less than $950. 21 petition referred to two convictions, which he erroneously g denying the petitions in both cases referred only to section 530.5. the minute order for the hearing stated that the court found was an ineligible offense. as mountford points out, where there the oral ruling is controlling. (people v. farell (2002) 28 cal.4th 381, 384, fn. 2; people v. mullins (2018) 19 cal.app.5th 594, 612.) mountford thus requests that we remand the case back to the trial court for a ruling as to his section 115 conviction. we conclude that violation of section 115 is not an eligible offense. therefore, a remand is unnecessary. every person who knowingly procures or offers any false or forged instrument to be filed, registered, or recorded in any public office within this state, which instrument, if genuine, might be filed, registered, or recorded under any law of this state or of the united states, is guilty of a felony.stealing, mutilating, and falsifying judicial and public records crichapter 5, [s]ection 115 was designed to prevent the recordation of spurious documents knowingly offered for record. [citation.] . . . section 115 is to protect the integrity and reliability of public records. [citations.] (people v. denman (2013) 218 cal.app.4th 800, 808.) it contains no requirement that the document offered for recording have been 22 of theft. (romanowski, supra, 2 cal.5th at p. 912.) the crime is the recordation of the false document itself, not the theft of any property in order to accomplish the offense or as a result of the offense. thus, section 115 does not fall within the scope of proposition 47. (see people v. page, supra, 3 cal.5th at pp. 1186-1187 [proposition 47 applies to offenses criminalizing conduct constituting theft of property valued at $950 or less].) no remand is necessary for the trial court to rule on whether requirements of proposition 47. as a matter of law, it does not. (see people v. lynn (2015) 242 cal.app.4th 594, 598-599 [where defendant not ineligible for resentencing as a matter of law, remand required to determine eligibility for resentencing under proposition 36]; cf. people v. baker (2018) 20 cal.app.5th 711, 721.) disposition the orders are affirmed. not to be published johnson, j. we concur: 23 rothschild, p. j. weingart, j.* * judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
