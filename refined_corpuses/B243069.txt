the other man was wearing a gray hooded sweatshirt. after the robbers fled with the money, singh notified urveillance videos were played for the jury. singh was unable to identify either of the robbers. later on september 28, 2010 janell morgan was working as a cashier at another gas station when two men, one wearing a black hooded sweatshirt and the other wearing a gray hooded sweatshirt, entered the store. the man in the black sweatshirt, who morgan identified as hunter, demanded the money from the cash register at gunpoint. after morgan opened the cash register, the men removed the money and left the store. alec call, who worked next to the gas station where morgan was employed, saw two men wearing hooded sweatshirts arrive in a black sedan, park in the lot in front of his 3 4 office and walk to the gas station. call wrote down the license plate number; drew the police officers located the sedan, which was owned by dashawn combs, and followed it to the avalon housing pro after hunter was arrested on october 18, 2010, detective keith soboleski advised him of his rights to remain silent, to the presence of an attorney and, if indigent, to appointed counsel (miranda v. arizona (1966) 384 u.s. 436 [86 s.ct. 1602, 16 l.ed.2d 694]). hunter agreed to be interviewed. he initially denied knowing williams but then admitted williams was his godbrother. hunter also admitted having associating with several members of the avalon garden crips (a.g.c.) gang but denied he was a gang member. los angeles police officer armando leyva testified as an expert on the a.g.c. gang. according to leyva, the gang had approximately 160 members including williams, combs and hunter, each of whom had admitted his gang membership to leyva. the primary activities of the a.g.c. gang were robbery, assault with deadly weapons, burglary, kidnapping and homicide. leyva described two robberies committed by a.g.c. members in 2009 and 2010. hunter had a.g.c. gang tattoos on his shoulders. when presented with a hypothetical based on the facts of this case, leyva opined the crimes would have been committed for the benefit of the a.g.c. gang and with the intent to promote future criminal conduct by a.g.c. gang members. hunter neither testified nor introduced other evidence in his defense. 4. verdict and sentencing the jury found hunter guilty on all counts and found true the personal firearm-use and criminal street gang enhancement allegations. hunter waived his right to a jury trial and elected to have a bench trial on the prior conviction allegations. following the bench trial the court found true the prior strike conviction as alleged in the information but found not true the prior prison term allegation. 5 the court sentenced hunter to an aggregate state prison term of 48 years 4 months: on count 2, six years (the middle term of three years doubled under the three strikes law) for second degree robbery, plus 10 years for the criminal street gang enhancement, plus 10 years for the firearm-use enhancement; on each of counts 3 and 4, a consecutive term of two years (one-third the middle term of three years doubled under the three strikes law) for second degree robbery, plus one-third of 10 years for the criminal street gang enhancement, plus one-third of 10 years for the firearm-use enhancement. the court also imposed a five-year term for the prior serious felony enhancement. the court awarded hunter presentence custody credit of 753 days (655 actual days and 98 days of conduct credit). the court ordered hunter to pay a $40 court security fee and a $30 criminal conviction assessment on each count and a $200 restitution fine. the court imposed and suspended a parole revocation fine pursuant to section 1202.45. 5 just before closing arguments hunter attempted to address the jury regarding the the police report. the trial court refused to allow hunter to speak to the jury noting he had elected not to testify. however, the court told hunter he could bring the police report containing the purported contradictory statements to the next court hearing. the following day the jury announced it had reached a verdict. as the verdicts were being read, hunter spoke to the jury. after being ordered by the trial court to stop, hunter was removed from the courtroom for ignoring the order and continuing to address the jury. once the jury was excused, the trial court informed hunter of the verdicts and asked him about the police report he had intended to bring to court. hunter responded he did not have the police report and said the copy defense counsel gave him did not match his own copy. the court then told hunter he could bring his copy of the report to the sentencing hearing. the record does not indicate hunter produced the report at the sentencing hearing. 6 discussion we appointed counsel to represent hunter on appeal. after examination of the record counsel filed an opening brief in which no issues were raised. on january 16, 2013 we advised hunter he had 30 days within which to personally submit any contentions or issues he wished us to consider. we granted hunter two extensions of time and received a typed, 76-page supplemental brief, including exhibits, in which he challenged his conviction on a number of grounds.4 ved of his hunter was a gang member was inadmissible hearsay; the prosecutor improperly excluded qualified jurors based on race, influenced the testimony of the robbery victims and tampered with the evidence; the jury was biased and engaged in misconduct; his defense counsel rendered ineffective assistance; and his convictions were not supported by substantial evidence. they are without merit. hunter waived his right to a jury trial in favor of a bench trial on his prior conviction allegations; and, in any event, a bench trial on prior conviction allegations is not unconstitutional. (apprendi v. new jersey (2000) 530 u.s. 466, 490 [120 s.ct. 2348,147 l.ed.2d 435].) was not inadmissible hearsay. (see evid. code,  1220.) there is no transcript of the jury voir dire in the record on appeal to review for racially motivated peremptory challenges. (see batson v. kentucky (1986) 476 u.s. 79 [106 s.ct. 1712, 90 l.ed.2d 4 sic] brief. to the extent he relies on matters outside the record on appeal in making certain information), hunter should file a proper petition for writ of habeas corpus in the trial court. 7 69].) having failed to complain of prosecutorial misconduct at trial, hunter has forfeited the issue on appeal. (people v. samayoa (1997) 15 cal.4th 795, 841.) in any event, nothing in the record indicates the prosecutor committed misconduct at any point during the trial court proceedings. (people v. avila (2009) 46 cal.4th 680, 711.) the record also fails to demonstrate the jury was biased or engaged in any misconduct (in re boyette (2013) 56 cal.4th 866, 888-898) or defense counsel provided ineffective assistance. (strickland v. washington (1984) 466 u.s. 668, 686 [104 s.ct. 2052, 80 l.ed.2d 674].) finally, substantial evidence supported his robbery convictions (see people v. bolin (1998) 18 cal.4th 297, 331). complied fully with his responsibilities and no arguable issues exist. (smith v. robbins (2000) 528 u.s. 259, 277-284 [120 s.ct. 746, 145 l.ed.2d 756]; people v. kelly (2006) 40 cal.4th 106; people v. wende (1979) 25 cal.3d 436, 441.) the judgment is affirmed. perluss, p. j. we concur: woods, j. zelon, j.
