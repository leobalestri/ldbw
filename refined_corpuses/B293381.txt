(see auto equity sales, inc. v. superior court (1962) 7 57 cal.2d 450, 45stare decisis, all tribunals exercising inferior jurisdiction are required to follow b. appellant forfeited his challenge to the triimposition of assessments/fines appellant argues the trial court violated his federal and state right to due process by imposing a $40 court operations assessment, a $30 criminal conviction assessment, and a $300 restitution fine without determining whether he had the present ability to pay. appellant requests we vacate the assessments and stay the imposition of the restitution fine in light of people v. dueas (2019) 30 cal.app.5th 1157 (dueas). respondent contends appellant forfeited the issue because he did not object to the imposition of the fines and assessments or request a hearing to determine whether he had the ability to pay them. appellant concedes he did not object to or raise any due process argument regarding the assessments or the restitution failure to object at the trial level is excusable because it would have been futile, as dueas we sentencing hearing indicates that [appellant] was foreclosed from making the same request that the defendant in dueas made in people v. frandsen (2019) 33 cal.app.5th 1126, 1154.) appellant plainly could have made a record had his ability to pay the assessments and fine actually been an issue.

(id. at p. 1155; people v. bipialaka (2019) 34 cal.app.5th 455, 464.) further, we note the following with respect to the imposition of the $300 restitution fine per section 1202.4, subdivision (b). a reading of the language in subdivision (c) of that statute may be considered only in increasing the amount of the restitution fine in added.) here, the trial court imposed the minimum amount allowed$300.
