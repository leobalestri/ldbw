(people v. wende (1979) 25 cal.3d 436.) on june 1, 2012, we directed appointed counsel to send the record and a copy of counsels brief to defendant and notified defendant of his right to respond within 30 days. we received no response. in november 2011, defendant filed a motion to modify or strike restitution fines. in the motion, defendant stated that he was sentenced to a term of 50 years to life in 2003.2 he was ordered to pay restitution in the amount of $10,000, and a parole revocation fine in the same amount. he claimed to be unable to pay these fines because he is indigent. defendant attached an unorganized statement of points and authorities, discussing various subdivisions of section 1202.4, as well as other fines and fees. the trial court denied the motion, ruling that it was without jurisdiction to reduce the payment of the restitution fine under section 1202.4, subdivision (b). it also denied as untimely defendants request for a hearing, which is not included in the record on appeal. as explained in people v. turrin (2009) 176 cal.app.4th 1200, the trial courts order denying defendants motion is not appealable since the court lacked jurisdiction to consider the motion and its order did not affect defendants substantial rights.
