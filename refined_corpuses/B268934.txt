(a)(1)),2 based on evidence that he fired six gunshots into the home of isora harrell.3 the trial court in that case found terry had two prior serious or violent felony convictions, a 1984 conviction for assault and a 1988 conviction for voluntary manslaughter, and sentenced terry under the three strikes law ( 1170.12, subds. (a)-(d), 667, subds. (b)-(i)) to an indeterminate term of 25 years to life. on november 6, 2012 the elprisoners serving third-which the third-strike sentence was imposed) is not a serious or violent felony to petition for recall of the sentence and for resentencing as a second-people v. johnson (2015) 61 cal.4th 674, 679-680; see people v. superior court (kaulick) (2013) 1 statutory references are to the penal code. 2 penal code former section 12021, subdivision (a), is now section 29800, subdivision (a), which became effective january 1, 2012. [citation.] the law revision commission comments to section 29800 make clear that the provision was carried over people v. correa (2012) 54 cal.4th 331, 334, fn. 1.) 3 the jury was unable to reach a verdict on additional charges of assault with a firearm ( 245, subd. (a)(2)) and shooting at an inhabited dwelling ( 246), and the trial court declared a mistrial on those counts. 3 215 cal.app.4th 1279, 1286 [proposition 36 provides a means whereby prisoners currently serving sentences of 25 years to life for a third felony conviction which was not a serious or violent felony may seek court review of their indeterminate sentences and, under certain circumstances, obtain resentencing as if they had only one prior serious or violent felony conviction].) proposition 36 went into effect november 7, 2012 (johnson, at p. 679), and the following month terry filed a petition for recall of his sentence and resentencing. petition, arguing that, under section 667, subdivision (e)(2)(c)(iii), and section 1170.12, subdivision (c)(2)(c)(iii), terry was not eligible for resentencing because he was armed with a firearm during the commission of his current offense. (see  1170.126, subd. (e)(2) [an inmate is not eligible for resentencing if the current sentence was imposed for any offense appearing in  667, subd. (e)(2)(c)(i)-(iii), or 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(c)(i)-(iii)];  667, subd. (e)(2)(c)(iii) [rmed with a the people submitted excerpts from the testimony at terry hold a gun up to the screen door of her apartment and fire six shots inside. in reply, terry argued that to be ineligible for resentencing only arm themselves, but also must commit some other offense, apart from the arming for this reason, he contended, his conviction for firearm possession did not disqualify him from resentencing. on december 1, 2015, after holding an eligibility hearing, the trial court denied petition. the court found that, under sections 1170.126, subdivision (e)(2), and 667, subdivision (e)(2)(c)(iii), terry was ineligible for resentencing because he was armed with a firearm during the commission of his current offense. terry timely appealed. 4 discussion strikes law is disqualified from resentencing [under proposition 36] if he or she has an (people v. hicks (2014) 231 cal.app.4th 275, 282 (hicks); see  1170.126, subd. (e).) one such factor is that th sentence was imposed for any offense appearing in sections 667, subdivision (e)(2)(c)(i)-(iii), or 1170.12, subdivision (c)(2)(c)(i)-(iii). ( aliarmed with a firearm or deadly weapon, or intended to cause great bodily injury to people v. osuna (2014) 225 cal.app.4th 1020, 1029 (osuna), quoting  667, subd. (e)(2)(c)(iii), 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(c)(iii); accord, hicks, at p. 282.) [a]rmed with a firearm has been statutorily defined and judicially construed to mean having a firearm available for use, either offensively or defensivelywe presume proposition 36. (osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1029; accord, people v. blakely (2014) 225 cal.app.4th 1042, 1051-1052 (blakely); see people v. white (2014) 223 cal.aavailability the ready access ].) the facts of this caseinto her home, support meaning of proposition 36, and terry does not dispute this. (see people v. brimmer (2014) 230 cal.app.4th 782, 796 [inmate ineligible for resentencing where witnesses testified they saw him in actual physical possession of shotgun]; osuna, at pp. 1026-1027 there are facts in the record of convarmed with a firearm had the firearm available for immediate offensive or defensive use during the commission of his or her current offense, the inmate is disqualified from resentencing .) 5 what terry disputes is that, within the meaning of proposition 36, he was armed 4 citing the language of the statute, rgues that the circumstance of being armed with a the current offense as an addition and not just be a part of the thus, according to terry, having been armed with a firearm will disqualify an inmate from resentencing under proposition 36 only if that fact a current offense other than, or in addition to, the offense of possessing a firearm as a felon. in other words, terry asserts that one cannot offense is possession of a firearm. there are two serious problems with argument. first, being armed with a firearm is not an element of the offense of possession of a firearm as a felon. (see people v. conley (2016) 63 cal.4th 646, 659, law holds that possession of a firearm does possession of a firearm by a felon]; blakely, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1052 [the elements of the offense are conviction of a felony and ownership or knowing possession, custody, or control of a firearm,people v. white, supra, 223 cal.app.4th at p. 524 [while the act of being armed with a firearm that is, having ready access to a firearm [citation] necessarily requires possession of the firearm, possession of a firearm does not necessarily require that the possessor be armed with itconvicted felon may be found to be a felon in possession of a firearm if he or she knowingly kept a firearm in a locked offsite storage unit even though he or she had no (people v. white, at p. 524; 4 retation we review de novo. (see people v. bradford (2014) 227 cal.app.4th 1322, 1332; people v. zeigler (2012) 211 cal.app.4th 638, 650.) 6 accord, people v. conley, at p. 659.) thus, a central supposition of incorrect. second, as terry acknowledges, courts have repeatedly and unanimously rejected his argument. (see people v. white (2016) 243 cal.app.4th 1354, 1362-1364 [rejecting the argument that the current offense of firearm possession cannot support a finding that the inmate was armed during its commission]; hicks, supra, 231 cal.app.4th at pp. 283-284 [rejecting the a court considering a petition for resentencing is precluded from finding the defendant was armed during the commission of the offense if the only current felony conviction here must be an underlying people v. brimmer, supra, 230 cal.app.4th at p. 797 [rejecting the possessory offenses can never fall under the armed with a firearm exclusion . . . without another separate or tethering offensepeople v. elder (2014) 227 cal.app.4th 1308, 1312 [rejecting the argument . . . must require something beyond osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1027 during the commission of thpurposes of [proposition 36], does not require the possession be fa to, an underlying felonypeople v. white, supra, 223 cal.app.4th at p. 527 [rejecting the the armed-with-a-firearm exclusion requires that the arming be anchored or tethered to an offense which does not include ]; see also blakely, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p.
