( 211.) he admitted personally using a firearm in commission of the offense, and inflicting great bodily injury on the victim. ( 12022.53, subd. (b), 12022.7, subd. (a).) he further admitted suffering a prior conviction of a serious or violent felony ( 667, subds. (a)(i), 1170.12, subds. (a)(d)), for which he served a prison term within the meaning of section 667.5, subdivision (b). the trial court sentenced leib to the upper term of six years in prison for the robbery, doubled pursuant to the three strikes law, plus five years for the section 667, subdivision (a) serious felony enhancement, three years for the section 12022.7, subdivision (a) great bodily injury enhancement, and 10 years for the section 12022.53, subdivision (b) firearm enhancement. in march 2018, leib, acting in propria persona, filed a motion for modification of sentence or a clarification order regarding sentencing under penal code  as far as we can discern, that motion primarily challenged imposition of the section 667.5, subdivision (b) enhancement. however, at the end of the motion, leib also 1 all further undesignated statutory references are to the penal code. 3 stated: sic) in gun enhancements helps get that train started so i may get some time taken off since the sb 620 bill got passed earlier this year or late on for resentencing pursuant to senate bill no. 620.

(see cal. rules of court, rules 8.308, 8.304(b);  1237.5.) e us. the same is true as to the section 667.5, subdivision (b) prior prison term enhancement. we have examined the record and are satisfied no arguable lly complied with the responsibilities of counsel.
