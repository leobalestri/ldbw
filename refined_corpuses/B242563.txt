(a)-(d) & 667, subds. (b)-(i)), for purposes of the five-year sentence enhancement of section 667, subdivision (a)(1), and for the one-year sentence enhancement of section 667.5, subdivision (b). on april 30, 2012, defendant accepted the prosecutions offer of a 19-year prison term, conditioned upon his plea to count 1 and an admission of both the firearm allegation and his prior robbery conviction. after advising defendant of his rights and the consequences of his plea, the trial court sentenced him to the low term of two years, doubled as a second strike, plus a consecutive five-year enhancement due to the 1998 robbery conviction, and a consecutive 10-year term for the personal use of a firearm. the court also imposed mandatory fines and fees, ordered defendant to provide biological samples, and scheduled a restitution hearing. at the restitution hearing, compensation to the victim was ordered in the agreed upon sum of $4,950. defendant was awarded presentence custody credit of 365 actual days plus 15 percent conduct credits, for a total of 419 days. defense counsel then informed the court that defendant wished to withdraw his plea based on his belief that he was misinformed regarding the five-year sentence enhancement. the court reminded defendant that he agreed to a 19-year sentence and explained how it was calculated. when defendant appeared to confuse the one-year prison prior enhancement with the 1 all further statutory references are to the penal code, unless otherwise indicated. 3five-year enhancement, the court explained the difference, and defendant said he understood. defendant filed a timely notice of appeal and applied for a certificate of probable cause, which the trial court denied. in his supplemental brief on appeal, defendant contends that the trial court imposed an unauthorized sentence enhancement and that counsel was ineffective for permitting him to admit the prior conviction. as defendants contentions affect the validity of his plea, we must dismiss the appeal.
