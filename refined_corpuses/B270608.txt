(former  12022.53, subds. (b), (c), (d) & (e)(1).) the jury also convicted silva of discharge of a firearm with gross negligence (count 2) ( 246.3, subd. (a)) and assault with a firearm with personal use of a firearm (count 5) (former  245, subd. (a)(2), 12022.5, subds. (a) & (d)). each of the offenses was committed for the benefit of a criminal street gang (former  186.22, subd. (b)(1)), and silva had suffered a prior felony conviction ( 667, subd. (d)). after resentencing on count 1, sil plus 80 years to life. in 2012, ws conviction and sentence on appeal. (people v. silva (may 16, 2012, b225127) [nonpub. opn.].) the california supreme court granted review and transferred the matter to us for reconsideration in light of miller v. alabama (2012) 567 u.s. 460. later in 2012, we and remanded to the trial court for resentencing. (people v. silva (dec. 28, 2012, b225127) [nonpub. opn.].) our supreme court again granted review and transferred the matter to us with directions to vacate our decision and reconsider the matter in light of people v. gutierrez (2014) 58 cal.4th 1354. we vacated the judgment in part and remanded for resentencing on count 3, the count on which silva received the lwop sentence, directing the court to exercise the full scope of its discretion under 4 gutierrez. (people v. silva (nov. 14, 2014, b225127) [nonpub. opn.].) on february 23, 2016, the trial court conducted a resentencing hearing at which both parties presented evidence, and heard argument from both sides. the court again sentenced silva to lwop on count 3, plus a consecutive term of 80 years to life. silva filed this timely appeal. discussion 1. lwop sentence are moot silva conreimposition of his lwop sentence is cruel and unusual punishment under the eighth amendment, and the trial court incorrectly applied montgomery v. louisiana (2016) ___ u.s. ___ [136 s.ct. 718], and its interpretation of miller v. alabama (2012) 567 u.s. 460. he also contends he was entitled to a presumption favoring a parole-eligible sentence; the trial court did not make the required finding that he was among the very rarest of juvenile offenders for whom rehabilitation is impossiblewhen it reimposed the lwop sentence; he was entitled to a jury determination whether he was in that group of offenders; and his lwop sentence is categorically barred by the california constitution. while this appeal was pending, the legislature enacted sb no. 394. the parties filed supplemental briefs. in light of the new law, we s to his lwop sentence are moot. sb no. 394 became effective january 1, 2018, amending section 3051 to add subdivision (b)(4), reading as follows: 5 offense that was committed before the person had attained 18 years of age and for which the sentence is life without the possibility of parole shall be eligible for release on parole by the board during his or her 25th year of incarceration at a youth offender parole hearing, unless previously released or entitled to an earlier parole consideration hearing the amwere not final when the amendments became effective. (people v. arredondo (2018) 21 cal.app.5th 493, 507; in re estrada (1965) 63 cal.2d 740, 745.) the parties agree that silva is now eligible for a parole suitability hearing during his 25th year of incarceration. (see people v. lozano (2017) 16 cal.app.5th 1286, 1290.) silva has had an adequate opportunity (in his 2016 resentencing hearing) to assemble a record of his background, characteristics, and circumstances that will be relevant at a youth parole offender hearing. (see people v. franklin (2016) 63 cal.4th 261, 277, 283-284.) the statutory amendments, which were not in effect at the time of his resentencing in february 2016, now guarantee him the relief he requests. the amendments are an event that makes him any effectual relief. (people v. deleon (2017) 3 cal.5th 640, 645.) 6 2. remand is required for the juvenile court to conduct a transfer hearing in supplemental briefing, silva argues proposition 57 applies retroactively to his case, and we agree. silva was charged in adult criminal court under the law then in effect, which permitted the prosecutor to charge the case directly in adult court. in november 2016, long after silva had been convicted and sentenced in 2010 but while his case remained pending on appeal, the voters passed proposition 57, which eliminated direct filing and prohibits prosecutors from charging juveniles with crimes directly in adult court. under proposition 57, the action must commence in juvenile court; if the prosecution wishes to try the juvenile defendant as an adult, the juvenile court must conduct a transfer hearing. (see welf. & inst. code,  707, subd. (a).) the matter to adult court can the juvenile be tried and sentenced people v. superior court (lara) (2018) 4 cal.5th 299, 303 (lara).) in lara, our supreme court concluded that proposition 57 offered defendants the possibility of treatment as a juvenile in juvenile court, and therefore the inference of retroactivity of in re estrada (1965) 63 cal.2d 740 allowed the whose sentences were not yet final. (lara, at pp. 308-309.) peal is pending and his case is not yet final, so he is entitled to the benefits of proposition 57. we transfer the matter for further proceedings in the juvenile court. juvenile court shall, to the extent possible, treat the matter as though the prosecutor had 7 originally filed a juvenile petition in juvenile court and had then moved to transfer [the ] cause to a court of criminal jurisdiction. ([welf. & inst. code]  707, subd. (a)(1).) if, after conducting the juvenile transfer hearing, the court determines that it would have transferred [the defendant] to a a fit and proper subject to be dealt with under convictions and sentence are to be reinstated. ([welf. & inst. code]  707.1, subd. (a).) on the other hand, if the juvenile court finds that it would not have transferred [the defendant] to a court of criminal jurisdiction, then it shall adjudications and impose an appropriate (lara, supra, 4 cal.5th at p. 310 (quoting people v. vela (2017) 11 cal.app.5th 68, 82).) 3. if the juvenile court concludin adult criminal court, the adult court shall exercise its discretion under sb no. 620 the trial court imposed a 25-year sentence for the section 12022.53, subdivision (d) firearm enhancement on count 1. the court stayed punishment for firearm enhancements under section 12022.53, subdivisions (b) and (c) on count 1, under section 12022.53, subdivisions (b), (c), and (d) on count 3, under section 12022.53, subdivisions (c) and (d) on count 4, and under section 12022.5, subdivisions (a) and (d) on count 5. we 8 requested, and received, supplemental letter briefs on the effect of sb no. 620, and 12022.53, subdivision (h), effective january 1, 2018. we agree with silva that, as a defendant whose sentence is not yet final on appeal, e of its newfound discretion whether to strike the firearm enhancements. would exercise discretion to strike the firearm enhancement . . . if people v. billingsley (2018) 22 people v. almanza (2018) 24 cal.app.5th 1104, 1110-1111.) if the juvenile court detcase properly belonged in adult court, the juvenile court shall transfer the case to the trial court for that court to exercise its independent discretion under sb no. 620. disposition the judgment is conditionally reversed and the matter is remanded to juvenile court with the following directions. no later than 90 days from the filing of the remittitur, the juvenile court is directed to conduct a transfer hearing pursuant to welfare and institutions code section 707, subdivision (a). if, at the transfer hearing, the juvenile court determines it would have transferred jesse then the juvenile court shall transfer the case to the trial court for that court to exercise its independent discretion under senate bill no. 620. if, at the transfer hearing, the court determines it would criminal conviction shall be deemed a juvenile adjudication as of 9 that date. the juvenile court shall conduct a dispositional hearing within its usual timeframe and impose an appropriate disposition within its discretion under juvenile law. not to be published in the official reports egerton, j. we concur: edmon, p. j. lavin, j.
