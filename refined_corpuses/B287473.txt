(people v. ochoa (1993) 6 cal.4th 1199, 1206.) we do ute our (people v. jones (1990) 51 cal.3d 294, 314.) single witness is sufficient to uphold a judgment even if it is contradicted by other evidence, inconsistent or false as to other (people v. leigh (1985) 168 cal.app.3d 217, 221.) that upon no hypothesis whatever is there sufficient substantial evidence to support [the conviction]. [citation.] (people v. cravens (2012) 53 cal.4th 500, 508.) ii. substantial evidence supports the conviction a. fear as an element of robbery robbery is the felonious taking of personal property in the possession of another, from his person or immediate presence, ( 211.) the crime of robbery is a continuing offense that begins from the time of the original taking [and does not end] until the robber reaches a place of relative safety. [citation.] hence, where the property is peacefully acquired, but force or fear is then used to facilitate the carrying away of the loot or the 6 making good of an escape before the thief has reached a place of temporary safety, the crime is transformed into robbery. (people v. williams (2013) 57 cal.4th 776, 790-791 (dis. opn. of baxter, j.).) ce or fear (people v. smith (1995) 33 cal.app.4th 1586, 1595, italics added.) the force or fear element of robbery is stated in the disjunctive. necessary that the robbery be accomplished by means of both (people v. winters (1958) 163 cal.app.2d 619, 623; see people v. centers (1999) 73 cal.app.4th 84, 99-100.) use of fear or intimidation without force to induce the victim to part with property may constitute robbery. (people v. brew (1991) 2 cal.app.4th 99, 104; winters, at p. 623.) element of the offense of robbery because the offense may be (people v. tuggle (1991) 232 cal.app.3d 147, 155; see people v. reeves (2001) 91 cal.app.4th 14, 52; people v. brown (1989) 212 cal.app.3d 1409, 1418, disapproved on another ground in people v. hayes (1990) 52 cal.3d 577, 628, fn. 10.) although the taking must be accomplished by force or fear, the defendant need not have intended the victim to experience force or fearonly to deprive the victim of the property permanently. (people v. anderson (2011) 51 cal.4th 989, 995-996.) to establish the element of fear, the victim need not testify that he or she was afraid. (see people v. mungia (1991) 234 cal.app.3d 1703, 1709, fn. 2.) there need only be evidence from which it can be inferred that the victim felt fear and that the fear allowed the crime to be accomplished. (ibid.) [t]he fear necessary for robbery is subjective in natur 7 the victim was in fact afraid, and that such fear allowed the crime to be accomplished. [citation.] (people v. anderson (2007) 152 cal.app.4th 919, 946.) the element of fear need not arise from an express threat; intimidation of the victim is enough. (people v. morehead (2011) 191 cal.app.4th 765, 774-775.) fear may be generated by words, actions, or the surrounding circumstances, and it may arise after the taking. (people v. flynn (2000) 77 cal.app.4th 766, 771-772.) and while the victim must actually become afraid, the fear need not be extreme: it need only be enough to cause the victim to comply with the demand for the property. (people v. cuevas (2001) 89 cal.app.4th 689, 698; morehead, at pp. 774-775.) the fear element is satisfied when there is sufficient fear to cause the victim to comply with the unlawful demand for his or her property. (people v. davison (1995) 32 cal.app.4th 206, 212; people v. smith, supra, 33 cal.app.4th at p. 1595; morehead, at p. 775.) the force or fear element of robbery can be satisfied during either the caption or the asportation phase of the taking.(people v. gomez (2008) 43 cal.4th 249, 261.) b. deharo accomplished his theft through fear js actually had a knife or directly threatened [js] mark. under the law, as discussed above, deharo did not need to apply force to js, possess a knife or directly threaten js with a knife. instead, through words and/or actions, deharo needed only to cause enough fear in js so that js felt obliged to let deharo people v. williams, supra, 57 8 cal.4th at p. 791.) here, deharo did exactly thatwhen peacefully challenged by js, deharo reacted by making both moved his hand toward his pocket and repeated his threat to stab js). under such circumstances, confrontation, allowing deharo to carry off the stolen sunglasses. since the verdict was supported by substantial evidence, we affirm the judgment. disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published johnson, j. we concur: rothschild, p. j. bendix, j.
