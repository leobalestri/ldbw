filed 7/26/17 p. v. equivias ca2/2 not to be published in the official reports california rules of court, rule 8.1115(a), prohibits courts and parties from citing or relying on opinions not certified for publication or ordered published, except as specified by rule 8.1115(b). this opinion has not been certified for publication or ordered published for purposes of rule 8.1115. in the court of appeal of the state of california second appellate district division two the people, plaintiff and respondent, v. miguel alberto esquivias et al., defendants and appellants. b268972 (los angeles county super. ct. no. pa077370) appeal from judgments of the superior court of los angeles county. daniel b. feldstern, judge. affirmed in part, reversed and remanded in part with directions, and modified. stephen temko, under appointment by the court of appeal, for defendant and appellant miguel alberto esquivias. brett harding duxbury, under appointment by the court of appeal, for defendant and appellant kimberly alexis garcia. victoria h. stafford, under appointment by the court of appeal, for defendant and appellant alondra salinas. 2 xavier becerra, attorney general, gerald a. engler, chief assistant attorney general, lance e. winters, senior assistant attorney general, scott a. taryle, supervising deputy attorney general, and pamela c. hamanaka, deputy attorney general, for plaintiff and respondent. * * * * * * member of the clique, and was aided by two others. a few days and to threaten him. then two of them committed two armed robberies. all three were convicted of murder, two were convicted of robbery, and one was convicted of making criminal threats. all of them appeal, challenging the sufficiency of the evidence as to several counts, arguing that the trial court erred in instructing the jury and admitting certain items of evidence, asserting that the prosecutor engaged in misconduct, and contending that the trial court made several sentencing errors. we conclude there was no reversible error except as to two argumentsnamely, that (1) onconviction for criminal threats must be reversed because the jury was not instructed on the lesser included crime of attempted criminal threats, and (2) another reduced to a misdemeanor. we also order that the abstracts of judgment be corrected. otherwise, we affirm the convictions and sentences. facts and procedural background i. facts a. killing of manuel haro on june 11, 2013, defendant miguel esquivias (esquivias) walked up to manual haro (haro) and shot him several times in the chest. haro died from those injuries. 3 the shooting was the culmination of a feud between the wicked insane diablos street gang. in years prior, haro, his best friend james posey (posey), esquivias, and defendant kimberly garcia (garcia) had been friends; all four also belonged to the 818 clique. however, in the months leading up to june 2013, haro and posey had a bit of a falling out with esquivias and garcia because (1) garcia believed haro and posey had something to do with the death of garbrother the year before; (2) esquivias had loaned posey $250 that posey never repaid; and (3) haro had expressed romantic interest in ds romantic involvement with garcia. by early june 2013, the rift between the two groups of the wicked insane diablos directed esquivias and his friends to posey; killing haro was considered gang. esquivias sent posey a message over facebook, promising, a fu garcia threatened both haro and posey,and sent him text . . . ima kill you, dog. and this is my heart,nna find you two days before the shooting, garcia and salinas everything they did, i swear. and ima be by your side the whole several hours later, garcia told salinas she was 4 garcia and salinas then in a gold toyota camry, esquivias shot haro, and garcia and salinas drove esquivias away. b. threats to posey nine days after the shooting, on june 20, 2013, esquivias, garcia, and salinas called another 818 clique member. on speaker phone and within earshot of posey, all three chimed in to say that they had killed haro and were posey. c. robberies on june 26, 2013, esquivias and garcia robbed two people at gunpointdevin rivas and christopher lares. when they robbed lares, garcia was carrying a knife and esquivias asked rivas for his gang affiliation. among the items taken were s aniphones. d. arrest and postarrest behavior esquivias, garcia, and salinas (collectively, defendants) were arrested on june 27, 2013, in a gold toyota camry. garcia was driving, salinas was the front-seat passenger, and esquivias was seated in the rear passenger seats iphone in her possession, but had reprogrammed it to show that it belonged to her. s mother from jail. s s attorney had told her that a gold camry s mother d you guys, you guys need . . . to s 5 involvement in the shooting; garcia in no way disputed her involvement. ii. procedural background the people charged (1) all three defendants with murder (pen. code,  187, subd. (a))1; (2) esquivias with being a felon in possession ( 29800, subd. (a)(1)); (3) all three defendants with making criminal threats to posey ( 422); (4) esquivias and garcia with the second degree robbery of rivas ( 211); (5) esquivias and garcia with the second degree robbery of lares ( 211); and (6) salinas with possessing stolen property ( 496, subd. (a)). the people also alleged that all crimes, except the felon-in-possession count, were for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with a criminal street gang ( 186.22), that great bodily injury or death ( 12022.53, subd. (d)), and that the robberies involved a principal who was armed ( 12022, subd. s personal use of a firearm ( 12022.5, subd. (a)). the people further alleged that esquis 2012 conviction for first degree burglary ( 459) constituted a prior e meaning of our three strikes law ( 667, subds. (b)-(j) & 1170.12, subds. (a)-felony ( 667, subd. (a)(1)). the case proceeded to a joint trial in may 2015. a jury returned mixed verdicts. the jury found esquivias guilty of first degree murder, being a felon in possession, and both robberies; it acquitted him of making a criminal threat. the jury found garcia guilty of first degree murder, making a 1 all further statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise indicated. 6 criminal threat, and both robberies. the jury found salinas guilty of second degree murder and receipt of stolen property; it acquitted her of making criminal threats. the jury found all of the gang, firearm, and armed principal enhancements to be true. the trial court sentenced each defendant. as to esquivias, the court imposed a total sentence of 37 years 8 months plus 75 years to life. the court calculated the 37 years and 8 months by imposing (1) 29 years on the robbery against lares, comprised of a four-year base term (two years, personal use of a firearm plus 10 years because the crime was gang-related plus five years due to his prior serious felony; and (2) a consecutive term of eight years and eight months on the robbery against rivas, comprised of a two-year base term (one-third of a midterm three-year sentence, doubled due to s prior strike) plus three years and four months (one-third of 10 years) for the personal use of a firearm plus three years and four months (one-third of 10 years) because the crime was gang related. the court calculated the consecutive 75-year-to-life sentence by imposing a base sentence of 50 years for the first s prior strike) plus a firearm enhancement of 25 years to life. the court s motion to strike his prior strike conviction under section 1385. s felon-in-possession sentence under section 654. as to garcia, the court imposed a total sentence of 12 years plus 50 years to life. the court imposed 12 years for the robbery against lares, comprised of a base term of two years plus 10 t calculated the consecutive 50-year-to-life sentence by imposing a base sentence 7 of 25 years for the first degree murder plus a 25-year-to-life firearm enhancement. the court ran a 12-year sentence for the robbery against rivas and a six-year four-month sentence for the criminal threat concurrently to one another and to the initial robbery sentence. as to salinas, the court imposed a total sentence of 40 years to life. the court imposed a 40-year sentence for the second degree murder, comprised of a 15-year-to-life base term plus a 25-year-to-life firearm enhancement. the court ran a 16-month sentence for receiving stolen property concurrently. each defendant filed a timely notice of appeal. discussion i. evidentiary issues evidentiary rulings. we review such rulings for an abuse of discretion (people v. clark (2016) 63 cal.4th 522, 597), but independently review whether those rulings violate constitutional guarantees (people v. albarran (2007) 149 cal.app.4th 214, 224-225, fn. 7). a. as noted above, during a jailhouse call between garcia and s mother, garcia did not objectyeah s mother reprimanded garcia for not into her car, which was the very same seating arrangement defendants had at the time of their arrest. the trial court admitted the statement, against garcia only, as an adopted admission and a declaration against penal interest. salinas (joined by esquivias) argues that introduction of this statement 8 at the joint trial (1) violated the confrontation clause, (2) violated due process, and (3) was an abuse of discretion under evidence code section 352. 1. confrontation clause under the so-called aranda/bruton sixth amendment right to confront witnesses is violated when a -of-court statement implicating the defendant is introduced into evidence unless the codefendant testifies (and is subject to cross-examination) or unless the portions of the statement implicating the defendant are redacted in a non-obvious way. (people v. capistrano (2014) 59 cal.4th 830, 869; see generally people v. aranda (1965) 63 cal.2d 518; bruton v. united states (1968) 391 u.s. 123.) salinas argues that the doctrine because it is an out-of-court statement implicating salinas, salinas did not have the opportunity to cross-examine garcia, and the statement was not redacted. we reject this argument. in crawford v. washington (2004) 541 u.s. 36, 68 (crawford), the united states supreme court narrowed the scope of the right to confrontation; it now bars only those out-of-an out-of-people v. leon (2015) 61 cal.4th 569, 602-603, quoting people v. lopez (2012) 55 tement davis v. washington (2006) 547 u.s. 813, 822 (davis)). by narrowing the right of confrontation generally, crawford also limited the right of confrontation protected by aranda/bruton: unless 9 testimonial within the meaning of crawford, its admission at a joint trial does not violate aranda/bruton. (people v. arceo (2011) 195 cal.app.4th 556, 571, citing u.s. v. figueroa-cartagena (1st cir. 2010) 612 f.3d 69, 85; u.s. v. johnson (6th cir. 2009) 581 f.3d 320, 326.) garcwas not testimonial because it was a casual conversation between two private individualss mother. (see people v. hajek and vo (2014) 58 cal.4th 1144, 1214 people v. cage (2007) 40 cal.4th 965, 989-990, fn. 20 [statements to private doctors not testimonial]; people v. blacksher (2011) 52 cal.4th 769, 817-818 [statements made to family members not testimonial].) salinas raises two arguments in response. first, she asserts that kansas v. carr (2016) 136 s.ct. 633 rejects the notion that crawford narrowed the scope of the aranda/bruton doctrine. we disagree. carr held that the bruton doctrine does not apply to joint capital sentencing proceedings. (carr, at pp. 645-646.) nothing in carr states or implies anything about crawfords effect on bruton. second, salinas argues that the private conversation took place over a jailhouse phone, and that this fact distinguishes it from an ordinary private conversation because these calls are recorded (as the call participants are informed) and because law enforcement sometimes uses them in prosecutions (as was done here). we need not decide, as a general matter, whether an otherwise private conversation somehow becomes testimonial if it takes place in an area monitored by jail officials because in this case garcia expressed her belief that, notwithstanding the warnings that jailhouse calls 10 as a result, her statements were not being made with the primary purpose of [ing] or prov[ing] (davis, supra, 547 u.s. at p. 822), and were accordingly not testimonial. 2. due process among other things, due process protects against the ds some principle of justice so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people as to be people v. falsetta (1999) 21 cal.4th 903, 913.) it is wel[a]pplication of the ordinary rules of evidence generally does not impermissibly infringe on a . . . (people v. eubanks (2011) 53 cal.4th 110, 143.) because salinas does not dispute that properly admitted as adoptive admissions and declarations against penal interest (evid. code,  1221 & 1230), the trial process. salinas nevertheless effectively put before the jury admission garcia adopted came from s mother, who s attorney had told her that (3) a witness to this argument overlooks the fact that these three statements were admitted not to prove the (people v. silva (1988) 45 cal.3d 604, 624; people v. jennings (2010) 50 cal.4th 616, 661-662 (jennings) [same].) because they were not admitted for their truth, they are not hearsay at alllet alone impermissible hearsay. (evid. code,  1200, subd (a) 11 than by a witness while testifying at the hearing and that is offered to prove the truth of the matter stated 3. evidence code section 352 evidence code section 352 grants a trial court discretion to exclude otherwise relevant evidence if its probative value is admission is, in effect, an acknowledgment that she drove probative evidence of her guilt. the trial court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the countervailing factors set forth in evidence code section 352 did not substantially outweigh that probative value. b. admission of gang expert testimony the people called a gang expert who testified, among other things, that (1) the wicked insane diablos was a street gang with more than 60 members and whose primary activity was the weapon and ; (2) two wicked insane diablo members had, in 2010 and 2012, committed felonies; (3) the 818 clique was the san fernando valley-based arm of the rowland heights-based wicked insane diablos; (4) esquivias and garcia were members of the wicked insane diablos; (5) -fledg . . . of the wicked insane diablosd the wicked insane diablos by ending a division within the gang that made the gang look weaker to rivals; and (7) the two robberies benefited the wicked insane diablos by instilling fear in the 12 community and obtaining property to use operations. salinas (joined by esquivias) argues that the trial court (1) violated the confrontation clause in allowing the expert to testify about her gang affiliation based on the out-of-court statements of others; (2) violated due process by allowing the prosecutor to admit false testimony regarding her gang affiliation; and (3) erred in admitting this highly prejudicial 352 and 1101, subdivision (b). 1. confrontation clause in people v. sanchez (2016) 63 cal.4th 665, 680 (sanchez), our supreme court held the admission of out-of-court statements in a criminal case sometimes requires -(1) are the statements properly admitted under the hearsay rule (and its many exceptions)?; and (2) if the statements are hearsay, crawford and, if so, has or will the defendant have the opportunity to cross-examine the declarant? sanchez testimony would be subject to the two-step analysis set forth above, and which aspects would not. under sanchez, an expertwithout having to satisfy the two-step analysis . . . rely on hearsay in forming an opinion, and may tell the jury in general terms sanchez, supra, 63 cal.4th at pp. 685-686 . . . whether or not admissible, that is of a type that reasonably may be relied upon by an expert in forming an opi may tell the jury the specific . . . training and 13 experience, even though that information may have been derived from conversations with others, lectures, study of learned treatises, sanchez, at pp. 675-676), or (b) t (id. at p. 675). however, an expert may notwithout satisfying the two-step analysiscase--of- he to the particular events and participants alleged to have been inv(id. at pp. 676, 684, 686.) largely did not transgress sanchez. the expert testified to his opinion that salinas was an associate of the wicked insane diablos and that that [he had] been because sanchez hearsay in forming an opinion, and [to] tell the jury in general terms -part analysis, this testimony was properly admitted. (sanchez, supra, 63 cal.4th at pp. 685-686.) , this would also of the hearsay the expert relied upon because at no time did he case--s attorney elicited that the expert might have been shown a field s name on it, but the expert testified on redirect examination that the existence of a field identification card did not matter to his opinion regarding . because sanchez held that recounting the content of a field identification card might 14 constitute a case-specific statement that could be testimonial (sanchez, card could be construed as error. however, any errorwith respect to the reference of a possible field identification card or the sources of information the expert citedwas harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. (sanchez, supra, 63 cal.4th at p. 698 [applying harmless beyond a reasonable doubt test].) that is because the expert expressly noted that the field identification card did not matter to his analysis and because there was overwhelming other evidence of s association with the wicked insane diablosnamely, s facebook post ing it down for ; (2) s the wicked insane diablos; (3) ga; (4) s participation in the threatening june 20 killing; and (6) the testimony of posey and others that salinas was actively participating in conduct with other wicked insane diablos members. 2. presentation of false evidence his or her knowing failure to correct the presentation of such evidence by others, violates due process. (napue v. illinois (1959) 360 u.s. 264, 269; people v. marshall (1996) 13 cal.4th 799, 829-830.) salinas argues that the prosecutor knowingly allowed the expert to testify falsely to the existence of a field identification card naming her. however, the expert testified that he was uncertain whether he ever saw that card; his testimony was not false. 15 3. actsevidence although evidence of uncharged conduct is inadmissible to prove that a defendant had a propensity to commit a charged crime (evid. code,  1101, subd. (a)), the people may introduce prior uncharged conduct to prove matters other than a (evid. code,  1101, subd. (b); people v. williams (2009) 170 cal.app.4th 587, 607). salinas contends that evidence of her association with the wicked insane diablos prejudiecause it shows that she had this contention lacks merit because salinas was charged with the gang enhancement, so evidence of her association with the gang s gang association involved her association with gang members or gang signs; as noted below, such association is not itself a crime. ii. instructional issues defendants also attack two jury instructions. we independently review instructional issues. (people v. nelson (2016) 1 cal.5th 513, 538.) a. receipt of stolen property instruction a trial court is required to instruct the jury on all of the elements of a charged crime, and the failure to do so is an error of constitutional dimension. (people v. merritt (2017) 2 cal.5th 819, 821-822.) in november 2014, the crime of felony receipt of stolen property was amended by voter initiative to require proof that the property taken be worth more than $950. ( 496, subd. (a).) s trial. (see people v. mutter (2016) 1 cal.app.5th 429, 437.) the trial 16 ue requirement. salinas argues that this was error, and the people concede she is right. we agree. although such error can be harmless beyond a reasonawas uncontested and supported by overwhelming evidence(merritt, at p. 832, quoting neder v. united states (1999) 527 u.s. 1, 17) there was no evidence introduced at trial regarding the value of the iphone that underlies the receipt of stolen property count. because no other elements of the crime are challenged, the remedy is to reduce the felony to a misdemeanor. (e.g., people v. love (2008) 166 cal.app.4th 1292, 1300-1301 [reducing theft from felony to misdemeanor when trial court omitted element on value of item taken].)2 b. attempted criminal threats instruction a trial court is required to instruct a jury on any lesser included offense to any charged from which a rational jury could conclude that the defendant committed the lesser offense, and that [s]he is not people v. whalen (2013) 56 cal.4th 1, 68, quoting people v. depriest (2007) 42 cal.4th 1, 50.) the crime of attempted criminal threats is a lesser included offense to the crime of criminal threats. (people v. toledo (2001) 26 cal.4th 221, 233-234 (toledo).) garcia argues that the trial court erred in not instructing the jury on the lesser included crime of attempted criminal threats because there was substantial evidence supporting such an instruction. 2 s further argument that the trial court erred in not instructing the jury on the lesser included crime of misdemeanor receipt of stolen property. 17 we agree. to prove the completed crime of making criminal threats, the people must prove, among other things, that toledo, supra, 26 cal.4th at p. 228, quoting people v. bolin (1998) 18 cal.4th 297, 337-340 & fn. 13; people v. allen (1995) 33 cal.app.4th 1149, 1156.) a defendant is guilty of only attempted criminal threats if she satisfies every other element of the crime but her threat does not cause the victim to be in sustained fear. (toledo, at pp. 233-234; in re sylvester c. (2006) 137 cal.app.4th 601, 607-608.) in this case, the people affirmatively elected to narrow the criminal threats count to a single incidentnamely, the threatening phone call on june 20, 2013. posey told police immediately aftecall, and testified at trial that he was not threatened during the callconductnamely, that he lied to defendants about his whereabouts, that he tried to evade defendants both before and after the call, that he was afraid to come to court, and that he tried to avoid testifyingsupports a reasonable inference that he was actually in fear and belies his could nevertheless reasonably support a finding that the call did not place him in sustained fear. the trial court was consequently obligated to instruct on the crime of attempted criminal threats. however, because none of the other elements of the crime is contested and, as described below, there is otherwise sufficient evidence to support a conviction of that crime, the people have the option of (1) retrying garcia on the crime of criminal threats 18 (with the jury to be instructed on the lesser included offense of attempted criminal threats), or (2) deciding not to retry garcia and consenting to modification of the judgment to reflect a conviction for attempted criminal threats. (see people v. edwards (1985) 39 cal.3d 107, 118.) iii. prosecutorial misconduct esquivias asserts that the prosecutor committed misconduct during closing argument because he said, waiting car on ventura canyon that . . . garcia and . . . salinas om the witnesses and from . . . esquivias himself that he went into the rear seat on the statement could be read to suggest that esquivias said garcia and salinas were in the waiting car, and that no such statement by esquivias was in evidence. we review this claim for an abuse of discretion. (people v. peoples (2016) 62 cal.4th 718, 792-793 (peoples).) esquivias has forfeited this claim. to preserve a claim of prosecutorial misconduct for review on appeal, a defendant must make a timely objection at trial and request an admonition to the jury, except where an objection would have been futile or an admonition ineffective. (people v. jackson (2016) 1 cal.5th 269, requested an admonition. esquivias asserts on appeal that such an objection would have been futile, but points to nothing in the record to support this assertion. esqs claim of prosecutorial misconduct lacks merit in any event, thereby obviating any claim that to object was constitutionally deficient or prejudicial. a 19 constiso egregious that it infects the trial with such unfairness as to make the conviction a denial of due process and violates the california the use of deceptive or reprehensible methods to attempt to peoples, supra, 62 cal.4th at pp. 792-793.) telling a jury about matters that are not in evidence constitutes misconduct. (people v. pinholster (1992) 1 cal.4th 865, 948, disapproved on another ground in people v. williams (2010) 49 cal.4th 405, 459.) however, wide latitudein closing arguments (people v. winbush (2017) 2 cal.5th 402, 484), and ambiguous comments will be construed as misconduct applied the complained-of comments in an improper or erroneous people v. seumanu (2015) 61 cal.4th 1293, 1337.) the comment esquivias assails is ambiguous insofar as it is unclear whether the prosecutor is saying that (1) esquivias said that garcia and salinas were waiting for him, or (2) that other evidence at trial so proved. there was no evidence of the former, but ample evidence of the lattermatched the description of the car witnesses saw at the scene and under these circumstances, it is not reasonably likely that the jury construed the prosecutor as making an argument not based on the evidence rather than one based on the evidence. what is more, any misconduct was not prejudicial (people v. alvarado (2006) 141 cal.app.4th 1577, 1585) because the jury guments were not evidence, and 20 we presume the jurors heeded that admonition (people v. ervine (2009) 47 cal.4th 745, 776). iv. sufficiency of the evidence defendants raise four different challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence. in evaluating these claims, we ask whether the record contains enough evidence that is reasonable, credible, and of solid value for a reasonable trier of fact to find the defendants guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. (people v. brooks (2017) 2 cal.5th 674, 729.) we must look at the entire record, construe accept [all] logical inferences that the jury might have drawn from the evidence.people v. salazar (2016) 63 cal.4th 214, 242 (salazar).) a. gang enhancement esquivias, joined by garcia and salinas, argues that there gang enhancement applied to the charged crimes. to prove the gang enhancement for a particular crime, the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with any criminal , or assist in any criminal conduct ( 186.22, subds. (b)(1) & (b)(4)(b); people v. rios (2013) 222 cal.app.4th 542, 561 [enumerating elements of gang enhancement].) proof of (rios, at p. 568, quoting people v. bloom (1989) 48 cal.3d 1194, , or assist criminal conduct by gang membersnot the gang itself (people v. albillar (2010) 51 cal.4th 47, 67 (albillar)). both elements may be established through expert testimony as long as 21 people v. ochoa (2009) 179 cal.app.4th 650, 659.) a person need not be a gang member for the enhancement to apply.

( 189; people v. chiu (2014) 59 cal.4th 155, 166; people v. cravens (2012) 53 cal.4th 500, 507.) a person is liable for a crime, including murder, if she commits the crime herself or if she aids and abets another in its commission. ( 31.) a person is liable as an aider and abettor if purpose, (2) she, by her act or advice, aids, promotes, encourages, or (3) she acts with the intent or purpose to commit, encourage, or (people v. mccoy (2001) 25 cal.4th 1111, 1118; people v. prettyman (1996) 14 cal.4th 248, 259; people v. beeman (1984) 35 cal.3d 547, 561.) when a person aids and abets a crime, she must share the same intent as the actual perpetrator. (mccoy, at p. 1118 & fn. 1; people v. nguyen (2015) 61 cal.4th 1015, 1054 (nguyen) specific intent when he or she knows the full extent of the commission of the crime.people v. maciel (2013) 57 cal.4th 482, 518 (maciel).) s plan to kill haro because salinas and garcia discussed it over text messages. she also encouraged the murder 25 in the car when esquivias hopped out to shoot haro and then got back in; s presence in the car from the facts that salinas was sitting in the front passenger seat and esquivias in the rear passenger seat at the time of their arrest and that esquivias got into the rear passenger seat after shooting haro because salinas was, by their custom, in the front passenger seat. salinas raises three arguments in response. first, she asserts that she did not help plan the murder, that she did not pull the trigger, that the people did not prove that she was at the scene, and that she was not on the june 20 phone call. these arguments lack merit. the fact that salinas did not plan the murder or pull the trigger is irrelevant to her liability as an aider and abettor; all that is needed is proof of her knowledge, intent, and encouragement (maciel, supra, 57 cal.4th at p. 518), and the people presented such proof. although salinas is correct that no y infer as much for the reasons noted above. in any event, a person need not be present at the scene to be an aider and abettor. (jennings, supra, 50 cal.4th at pp. 641-642, fn. 11.) salinas points to text something may ,s awareness of how dangerous the planned murder would be rather than hesitation to participate in it. and although the evidence is conflicting as to whether salinas herself took credit for the shooting during the june 20 callresolution of such conflicts. (see salazar, supra, 63 cal.4th at p. 242.) 26 dict rests solely both gang members. the evidence set forth above belies this assertion. (accord, nguyen, supra, 61 cal.4th at p. 1055 conflict and gang practices described by expert testimony sufficient to show aiding and abetting liability for attempted murder].) salinas cites u.s. v. garcia (9th cir. 1998) 151 f.3d 1243, 1245-1246 garcia addressed criminal liability by way of conspiracy, not aiding and abetting. murder. this concession means nothing because there was ample circumstantial evidence of her involvement, and a jury may give circumstantial evidence as much weight as direct evidence. (people v. anderson (2007) 152 cal.app.4th 919, 930; calcrim no. 223.) c. s conviction for receipt of stolen property salinas argues that there is insufficient evidence that she knew the iphone was stolen.3 to convict a person of receiving stolen property, the people must prove, among other things, that that the property received . . . people v. tessman (2014) 3 salinas also argues that there was insufficient evidence that the iphone was worth $950. we need not reach this issue because, as discussed above, we have reduced this conviction to a monetary threshold. 27 223 cal.app.4th 1293, 1302.) such evidence was present. salinas and garcia exchanged text messages in which salinas indicated she was near the area of the robberies at the time they were occurring. s iphone in her possession the day after the robbery and had personalized it. commit robberies and that salinas knowingly accepted the fruit of those robberies. d. garcia argues that there was insufficient evidence that above, this is an element of the complete crime of making criminal threats. (toledo, supra, 26 cal.4th at pp. 227-228.) also although at odds with what he sometimes saidcreated a reasonable inference that he was, in fact, actually in fear due to the threats made on the call. consequently, there was sufficient evidence of this element, even though the conviction must be ultimately vacated because the trial court erred in not instructing the jury on the lesser included offense of attempted criminal threats. v. sentencing issues a. s motion to strike his strike allegation esquivias argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion to strike (that is, to dismiss) the allegation that his 2012 first degree burglary conviction constitutes a strike within the meaning of our three strikes ldenial of such a motion for an abuse of discretion. (people v. carmony (2004) 33 cal.4th 367, 373 (carmony).) 28 a trial court has the discretion to grant a motion to dismiss a strike allegation. ( 1385, subd. (a); people v. williams (1998) 17 cal.4th 148, 162.) in deciding whether to exercise that nature and circumstances of [the defendants] present felonies and prior serious and/or violent felony convictions, and the particulars of his background, character, and prospects, the spirit, in whole or in part, and hence should be treated as though he had not previously been convicted of one or more serious carmony, supra, 33 cal.4th at p. 377.) the trial court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that esquivias did fall within the spirit of the three strikes law. the court noted that defendant was degree burglary he committed the year before murder and ries of both rivas and lares. the court reass involvement in these crimesnone of which is a felon[y] (19 at the time of the charged crimes), esquivias did not fall he spirit of the three strikes l ruling. first, he argues that the court was wrong to find that he actively participated in the first degree burglary because he was merely the lookout. but the court examined the court file from that prior case and determined that although esquivias did not enter the residence initially with his cohorts, he eventually did enter the house; thus, esquivias was more than a lookout. second, esquivias asserts that the court did not consider his age 29 or the absence of any juvenile adjudication. however, the courtas noted abovedid s age and was cognizant conduct started with the first degree burglary. third, esquivias asserts that the court was required to consider his status as a juvenile. but he was not a juvenile at the time of this crime. (accord, miller v. alabama (2012) 567 u.s. 460, 465 (miller).) lastly, esquivias asserts that he still would have a 50-year sentence on the murder case even if his prior strike was dismissed. however, this fact does not call ultimate conclusion. b. failure to consider factors relevant to juveniles while sentencing garcia garcia notes that she was under the age of 18 at the time of the charged crimes, and the trial court was obligated by the eighth amendment to consider several factors when imposing her sentence. we review this constitutionality claim de novo. (people v. em (2009) 171 cal.app.4th 964, 971.) the eighth amendment requires a juvenile court, before imposing a sentence of life without the possibility of parole or a term of years that amounts to a de facto life sentence on a person who was a juvenile at the time of her crimes, to consider the (1) lack of maturity, impulsiveness, and underdeveloped sense of responsibility, (2) vulnerability to negative influences and limited control of her own environment, and (3) lack of well-formed character. (miller, supra, 567 u.s. at p. 471; graham v. florida (2010) 560 u.s. 48, 68-69, 74-75; people v. caballero (2012) 55 cal.4th 262, 266-269.) however, our legislature enacted section 3051 as a means of assuring that juvenile defendants are accorded this eighth amendment right. 30 years of age , or 25 years after the imposition of sentence to enable the defendant to seek parole compared to adults, the hallmark features of youth, and any subsequent growth and increased maturity. 3051, subds. (a)(1), (b) & 4801, subd. (c).) our supreme court has held that the availability of section 3051 renders a -based constitutional challenge moot. (people v. franklin (2016) 63 cal.4th 261, 279- (garcia does not request a remand for purposes of assessing whether a hearing to receive evidence relevant to a future youth offense parole hearing is required.) c. s counsel at sentencing salinas argues that her trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective (1) for not correcting several factual errors in the probation report, and (2) for not seeking an updated report. we review claims of ineffective assistance of counsel de novo. (people v. mayfield (1993) 5 cal.4th 142, 199.) to establish that counsel was constitutionally ineffective, a criminal defendant bears the burden of showing (1) her standard of reasonableness . . . under prevailing professional people v. mickel (2016) 2 cal.5th 181, 198, quoting people v. lopez (2008) 42 cal.4th 960, 966.) n to forego a meritless objection is not deficient performance. (people v. lucero (2000) 23 cal.4th 692, 732.) 31 s counsel was not constitutionally ineffective. s first claim, she argues that the probation report before the trial court at the time of sentencing (rather than just an associate of the gang), that she was in she claims there was no evidence), and that shmurder on the june 20 call (of which she claims there was no evidence). to be sure, counsel has a duty to ensure sentence imposed is based on complete and accurate people v. cotton (1991) 230 cal.app.3d 1072, 1085-1086 (cotton).) even if we assume that counsel should have objected to the report, there is no reasonable probability that the report would have lead to a different sentence. to begin, a probation report is merely advisory. (people v. johnson (1999) 70 cal.app.4th 1429, 1432.) more importantly, the trial court was aware of the accurate facts: the court specifically noted the the gang, and the court heard the evidence at trial, which s s boasting about her s second claim, she asserts that her counsel should have requested an updated probation report. supplemental reports may be requested (cal. rules of court, rule 4.411(c)), and can cotton, supra, 230 cal.app.3d at pp. 1085-1086). but, for the reasons detailed above, no prejudice arose from the absence of a more recent report. 32 d. s presentencing credits salinas asserts that the trial court miscalculated her presentence credits, and the people agree. salinas was arrested on june 27, 2013, and sentenced on january 29, 2016. this entitles defendant to 947 days of actual credit, but the trial court awarded her only 868 days. because this issue may be raised for the first time on appeal along with other properly preserved claims (people v. mendez (1999) 19 cal.4th 1084, 1100-1101), we order that the abstract of judgment be amended to reflect a total of 947 days of custody credit. e. clerical errors in the abstracts of judgment 1. esquiudgment the indeterminate abstract of judgment for esquivias (1) fails to indicate the degree of murder of which he was he was sentenced to li accordingly, esquiviass abstract of judgment should be rst firearm enhancement. 2. udgment the indeterminate abstract of judgment for garcia incorrectly indicates that (1) she (2) that she was sentenced pursuant to the three strikes law-(i) or penal code section 33 1170.12, when she was notfor the section 12022.53, subdivisions (d) and (e) firearm enhancement, when the actual modified indication that garcia was sentenced pursuant to the three strikes law. 3. the indeterminate abstract of judgment for salinas incorrectly indicates that (1) she the section 12022.53, subdivisions (d) and (e) firearm plus enhancement time, when the actual sent enhancement; anabovejudgment on page 3, item 15, should be amended to reflect a total of 947 days of custody credit. 34 disposition is criminal threat is reversed. the matter is remanded to the trial court, and the people shall have 60 days from issuance of the remittitur from this court to decide whether to retry garcia for criminal threats. if the people do not file a charge of criminal threats within that period, the judgment shall be modified to reflect conviction for attempted criminal threats. the clerk of the trial court is directed to correct the abstracts of judgment to reflect the modifications discussed above and to forward the amended abstracts to the department of corrections and rehabilitation. as modified, the judgments are affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. ______________________, j. hoffstadt we concur: _________________________, acting p. j. ashmann-gerst _________________________, j. chavez
