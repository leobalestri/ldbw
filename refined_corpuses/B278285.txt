(apr. 10, 2012, b222428, b225438 [nonpub. opn.]). the details of the crimes are set forth in that opinion, and we derive the facts of the underlying case from that opinion. in short, in 2006, defendant and coconspirators forged grant deeds and other documents, sold and attempted to sell real properties they did not own, and pocketed the proceeds. at trial, a jury convicted defendant and one coconspirator of 51 counts of forgery, identity theft, grand theft, making false financial statements, and other crimes relating to six real estate transactions. as relevant to this appeal, defendant was convicted of 22 counts of forgery under penal code section 470, subdivision (a).1 in 2010, defendant was sentenced to 27 years and four months in prison. we affirmed and his coconvictions in 2012. on november 4, 2014, the voters enacted proposition 47, the safe neighborhoods and schools act, which went into effect the following day.

( 17, subforgery is rolland shelton. (see people v. shelton, nov. 10, 2015, b262081 [nonpub. opn.].) 5 punishable by imprisonment in a county jail for not more than one year, or by imprisonment pursuant to subdivision (h) of ].) proposition 47 amended section 473 to add a new subdivision (b) (section 473(b)), which states, in relevant notwithstanding subdivision (a), any person who is guilty of forgery relating to a check, s check, or money order, where the value of the check, bond, bank bill, note, s check, or money order does not exceed nine hundred fifty dollars ($950), shall be punishable by imprisonment in a county jail for not more than one year. . . . (people v. bloomfield (2017) 13 cal.app.5th 647, 651-652 (bloomfield).) do not fall under the scope of section 473(b). we agree. based on provides forgery will be classified as a misdemeanor when a defendant has used one of seven specific instruments (check, bond, bank bill, s check, or money (bloomfield, supra, 13 cal.app.5th at p. 652.) if the forgery does not involve one of the seven instruments specified in section 473(b), it may not be classified as a misdemeanor under proposition 47. the express identification of those seven instruments in section 473, subdivision (b) excludes from misdemeanor designation forgeries committed with (martinez, supra, 5 cal.app.5th at p. 242; see also bloomfield, supralanguage used in section 473(b) means forgery crimes are classified as straight misdemeanors only when one of the seven because 6 any of the seven instruments in section 473(b), this section does not apply. in his reply brief, defendant argues that martinez and bloomfield he contends that martinez and bloomfield involved credit card transactions and to these cases ar although martinez and bloomfield interpretation of section 473(b) is squarely applicable: section 473(b) does not apply to transactions other than the ones specifically listed in the statute. defendant also argues that the forged documents in this casea residential purchase agreement, a buyer inspection advisory, and a grant deed he cites people v. chretien (1902) 137 cal. 450, in which the evidence showed that the defendant forged a deed to real property. the defendant was charged with forgery under section 470, but he argued that the evidence only supported a charge for passing or publishing or check purporting to be the bill, note, or check or other instrument in writing for the payment of money the supreme court rejected this uttering of certain specified instruments. (id. at p. 453.) on the other hand, section 470 was written very broadly, and therefore (id. at p. 452-453.) forgery of any fictitious instrument mentioned in section 470, and 7 not mentioned or included in section 476, falls within the former section. (id. at p. 453.) defendant asserts that the chretien a deed transferring property was the same as a bill, note, or check, this misstates the holding of the case. moreover, interpretation of the statutes in chretien holdings in martinez and bloomfield, as well as our conclusion here, that section 473(b), a narrowly written statute involving specific instruments, does not encompass a broader class of instruments not included in the statute. defendant also argues in his reply brief that this case is similar to people v. mutter (2016) 1 cal.app.5th 429, in which the defendant pled guilty to possession of a counterfeit item under section 475, subdivision (a). (id. at p. 432.) the defendant later sought resentencing under proposition 47, asserting that the counterfeit currency he possessed met the definition of a the court noted that other statutes id. at p. 435.) the court concluded that fell within the scope of section 473(b). (id. at p. 436) defendant asserts that in mutteritems were similar in character to the section 473 enumerated counterfeit currency. instead, the court considered only whether 473(b). this holding is not applicable here, where defendant has made no effort to assert that a residential purchase agreement, a buyer inspection advisory, or a grant deed could fall within the 8 definitions of the seven instruments enumerated in section 473(b). in his opening brief, defendant did not address the trial convictions. instead, he devoted his opening brief to the argument that the trial court erred by finding that the amount of the losses at issue in the underlying convictions barred resentencing under proposition 47. because the forged documents at issue do not fall within section 473(b), however, the dollar amounts involved are irrelevant. disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports collins, j. we concur: epstein, p. j. willhite, j.
