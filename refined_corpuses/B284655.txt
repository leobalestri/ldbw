(a)). the complaint further alleged appellant suffered one prior conviction for a serious felony (pen. code,  1192.7) and served eight prior prison terms (pen. code,  667.5, subd. (b)). 1 all further statutory references are to the health and safety code unless otherwise indicated. 2 both parties refer to the probation report for these facts. 3 on january 23, 2012, appellant pled guilty to both charges and admitted one of the prison priors, a 2009 conviction for possession of cannabis for sale. ( 11359.) the trial court sentenced appellant to a total of four years in county jail: the upper term of three years on the possession count and one year for the prior prison term. in addition, the trial court sentenced defendant to time served on the misdemeanor driving without a license count. ate passed the control, regulate and tax adult use of marijuana act, proposition 64, which amended health and safety code section 11359 to provide, possesses marijuana for sale shall be punished by imprisonment in a county jail for a period of not more than six months or by a fine of not more than five hundred dollars ($500), or by both such (health & saf. code,  11359, subd. (people v. rascon (2017) 10 cal.app.5th 388, 392.) that is, it generally reduced section 11359 from a felony to a misdemeanor. person has one or more prior convictions for an offense specified in clause (iv) of subparagraph (c) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (e) of section 667 of the penal code or for an offense requiring registration pursuant to subdivision (c) of section 290 of the d in connection with the knowing sale or attempted sale of cannabis to a person ( 11359, subd. (c).) proposition 64 also added section 11361.8, which allows a under sections 11357, 11358, 11359, and 11360, whether by trial 4 or open or negotiated plea, who would not have been guilty of an offense or who would have been guilty of a lesser offense under the control, regulate and tax adult use of marijuana act had that act been in effect at the time of the offense, [to] file an application before the trial court that entered the judgment of conviction in his or her case to have the conviction dismissed and sealed because the prior conviction is now legally invalid or red ( 11361.8, subd. (e).) the criteria in subdivision (e) unless the party opposing the application proves by clear and convincing evidence that the petitioner does not satisfy the criteria in subdivision (e). once the applicant satisfies the criteria in subdivision (e), the court shall redesignate the conviction as a misdemeanor or infraction or dismiss and seal the conviction as legally invalid as now established under the control, regulate and tax adult use of ( 11361.8, subd. (f).) appellant filed a petition to redesignate or dismiss his 2012 section 11359 possession conviction on june 30, 2017. the trial court denied the petition on august 3, 2017, on the ground that appellant was not qualified for relief because he had three prior cannabis convictions: two possession convictions under section 11359 and one transportation conviction under section 11360. appellant timely appealed. discussion appellant contends that the trial court erred in denying his petition. he acknowledges that there are some circumstances in which violations of section 11359 remain felonies, but argues that none of those circumstances are applicable to him or this particular conviction. respondent agrees, as do we. 5 for a person to be ineligible to have his or her felony section 11359 conviction reduced to a misdemeanor, he or she of section 11359; one or more prior convictions that qualify as serious or violent under penal code section 667, subdivision (e)(2)(c) or require registration under penal code section 290, subdivision (c); or commit the instant offense by knowingly selling or attempting to sell cannabis to someone under age 18. ( 11359, subd. (c).) none of the convictions the court relied upon was serious, violent, or required registration, and none involved sale of cannabis to a minor. therefore, the relevant question is whether there was clear and convincing evidence that he had 11359. if not, the trial court was required to redesignate one of the three convictions the court cited involved a the other two cited convictions arose under section 11359. we agree with appellant and respondent that one of them, the 2009 conviction, was properly counted. appellant admitted the conviction as part of his guilty plea; accordingly, its existence was sufficiently proven under the clear and convincing standard applicable to the section 11361.8 inquiry. we further agree that the second section 11359 conviction should not have been counted. the trial court identified it by the case number of the instant offense, meaning it the trial court thus identified only one prior conviction under section 11359, subdivision (b), which is not sufficient to render the instant offense a felony. appellant was therefore entitled to 6 have the instant offense redesignated as a misdemeanor. disposition the order is reversed. the matter is remanded to the trial court with directions to and redesignate his january 23, 2012 section 11359 conviction as a misdemeanor. pursuant to the stipulation of the parties and the prior order of this court, remittitur is to issue three days after this opinion is filed. not to be published in the official reports collins, j. we concur: willhite, acting p. j. manella, j.
