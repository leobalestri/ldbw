(see pen. code,  16460, subd. (a)(5).) according to trial testimony, the process requires a liquid with a maximum flashpoint of 150, but any petroleum distillate will work. 4 procedural background by information filed july 9, 2015, defendant was charged with one count of use or attempted use of an explosive device (pen. code,  18740; count 1), one count of attempt to burn (pen. code,  455; count 2), and one count of criminal threats (pen. code,  422, subd. (a); count 3). the information also alleged that defendant had previously been convicted of violating vehicle code section 2800.3, and that the conviction was a serious or violent felony under the three strikes law. (pen. code,  667, subds. (b)(j), 1170.12, subds. (a)(d).) defendant pled not guilty and denied the allegation. after a bifurcated trial at which he did not testify, defendant was convicted of all counts. during deliberations, the jury asked for guidance in reaching a unanimous decision on counts 1 and 2. the record does not indicate that the court consulted counsel before replying that the jury should continue deliberating. ultimately, after deliberating for five-and-a-half hours over three days, the jury reached a decision on the substantive counts. following the verdicts on the substantive charges, jury trial began for the strike allegation. at the priors trial, the prosecution relied on three exhibits. to prove the existence and nature of the prior conviction, the prosecution presented certified minute orders from case no. ka043325.2 according to the minute order of april 13, 1999, the defendant in case no. ka043325 as relevant here, it also established that the defendant pled no 2 the prosecution did not provide any other documents from the record of conviction or a penal code section 969b packet. 5 contest to evading a peace officer with great bodily injury (veh. code,  2800.3, subd. (a)). the prosecution presented two additional exhibits to prove that defendant was the person who had been convicted in case no. ka043325. exhibit from his june 14, 2015, arrest in this case. exhibit 7 was a partially-redacted printout from the california law enforcement telecommunications system (clets), which reported criminal history information relating to an individual alternatively identified as william king jr., william kenneth king, william king, william kenneth king jr., and rey guillermo. the printout, which also contained four different social security provided below are based upon an arrest or court disposition report. the subject of the entry has been identified with this record based upon soft criteria consisting of a name or number match. positive identification has not been made because fingerprints were not received for the entries. use of this information is the receivers [sic] the report noted that in the 1999 case, defendant had not transmitted the arrest data to the department of justice.3 that the department of justice typically entered information into clets based on superior court minute orders. he defense argued that while there was evidence that defendant was the person in 3 that entry conflicts with the minute order, which indicates that the defendant in the 1999 case was arrested by the west covina police department. 6 the clets report, and while the 1999 conviction appeared in the report, there was no evidence that the department of justice had attached the 1999 conviction to the correct person. since the prosecution did not present any photographs, fingerprints, or other evidence to establish the identity of the person convicted in the 1999 case, and since the minute orders in that case did not tell whether defendant was indeed that person. accordingly, the defense moved to dismiss the alleged prior. the court concluded the prosecution had established identity beyond a reasonable doubt. (pen. code,  1025, subd. (c).) referring to the warning in the clets report, or number match. [] well, the number match has got to be the cii sic.)4 next, the jury was instructed that the court had concluded defendant was the person named in exhibits 68, and was told to determine whether he had been convicted of violating vehicle code section 2800.3 on april 13, 1999, in case no. ka043325. the jury found the allegation that defendant was convicted of 4 that notwithstdefendant was a number match rather than a name match. though we express no opinion about whether the evidence was sufficient to retains the burden of proving identity beyond a reasonable doubt. 7 prior case true. it was not instructed to determineand did not determinewhether defendant personally inflicted great bodily injury on a non-accomplice in the commission of that offense. driving offense for which somebody was seriously injured so the court denied motion to strike the prior, denied the defense motion for a new trial, and sentenced defendant to an aggregate term of 15 years and four months in state prison. the court selected count 1 (pen. code,  18740) as the base term and sentenced defendant to 14 yearsthe upper term of seven years, doubled for the strike prior. the court imposed 16 months for count 3 (pen. code,  422, subd. (a))one-third the middle term of two years, doubled for the strike priorto run consecutively. the court stayed count 2 (pen. code,  455) under penal code section 654. finally, the court recommended that the department of corrections and rehabilitation house defendant in a mental health facility. defendant filed a timely notice of appeal and we appointed counsel to represent him. on june 14, 2016, appointed counsel filed a brief in which he raised no issues and asked us to review the record independently. (people v. wende, supra, 25 cal.3d at p. 443.) after reviewing the record, the superior court file, and the exhibits, we asked appellate counsel and the people to provide us with supplemental briefing on several issues related to : was the evidence sufficient to establish that the prior conviction qualified as a strike offense? under the sixth amendment, should that issue have been resolved by the jury rather than by the court? if the evidence 8 was insufficient or the proceedings violated the sixth amendment, what is the proper remedy? discussion in response to our request for supplemental briefing, defendant argues, and the people agree, that there is insufficient conviction for violating vehicle code section 2800.3 qualified as a serious felony under the three strikes law. the parties also agree that we must remand for a further evidentiary proceeding, but appear to disagree about the precise nature of that proceeding. defendant argues that under descamps v. united states (2013) 570 u.s. __ [133 s.ct. 2276] (descamps), he has a sixth amendment right to a jury determination of whether he personally inflicted great bodily injury on a non-accomplice. the people contend that under descamps, the trial court may first examine the record of conviction in the prior case to determine whether defendant admitted facts sufficient to establish the strike; a jury need resolve only disputed factual issues. 1. there is insufficient evidence to support the strike finding. a criminal defendant may not be convicted of any crime or enhancement unless the prosecution proves every fact necessary for conviction beyond a reasonable doubt. (u.s. const., 5th amend.; u.s. const., 14th amend.; see cal. const., art. i,  7, 15; in re winship (1970) 397 u.s. 358, 364; people v. tenner to shoulder the burden of proving each element of a sentence .) this cardinal principle tenner, at p. 566) is so 9 fundamental to the american system of justice that criminal irrationality or error by the independent review of the sufficiency of the evidence undertaken by the trial and appellate courts. (united states v. powell (1984) 469 u.s. 57, 67.) here, we are concerned with whether the evidence was sufficient to support prior evading conviction (veh. code,  2800.3, subd. (a)) qualified as a strike. (people v. mcgee (2006) 38 cal.4th 682, 706.) 1.1. standard of review in assessing the sufficiency of the evidence, we review the entire record to determine whether any rational trier of fact could have found the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. (people v. zamudio disclose substantial evidence to support the verdicti.e., evidence that is reasonable, credible, and of solid valuesuch that a reasonable trier of fact could find the defendant guilty ibid.) in applying this test, we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution and presume in support of the judgment the existence of every fact the jury could reasonably deduce from the evidence. (people v. kraft (2000) 23 cal.4th 978, 1053.) deference is not abdication, however, and substantial evidence is not synonymous with any evidence. a decision supported by a mere scintilla of evidence need not be affirmed on appeal. [citation.] although substantial evidence may consist of inferences, those inferences must be products of logic and reason and must be based on the evidence.in re james r. (2009) 176 cal.app.4th 129, 135.) 10 1.2. the evidence does not establish that defendant personally inflicted great bodily injury on a non-accomplice. under californias three strikes law, a defendants sentence is doubled upon proof that he has been previously convicted of a strike offensea violent felony as defined in penal code section 667.5, subdivision (c), or a serious felony as defined in penal code section 1192.7, subdivision (c). (pen. code,  667, subd. (f)(1), 1170.12, subd. (d)(1).) although a violation of vehicle code section 2800.3 is not among the crimes listed in those statutes, it nevertheless qualifies as a serious felony within the meaning of the three strikes law, when it involve[s] the personal infliction of great bodily injury on any person, other than an accomplice (pen. code,  1192.8, subd. (a).) since not every evading conviction qualifies, the prosecution burden to prove each of the elements of this definition beyond a people v. valenzuela (2010) 191 cal.app.4th 316, 320 (valenzuela); people v. henley (1999) 72 cal.app.4th 555, 559.) here, the people properly concede that the prosecution did not produce sufficient evidence to establish that defendant personally inflicted great bodily injury on a non-accomplice. according to the certified minute orders in case no. ka043325, in 1999, defendant pled no contest to count 6 of as relevant here, the elements of vehicle code section 2800.3, subdivision (a), are: a peace officer in a vehicle was pursuing the defendant, who was also driving a vehicle; the defendant intended to evade the peace officer; 11 while driving, the defendant willfully fled from or tried to elude the pursuing peace officer; ee from or elude the pursuing peace officer proximately caused serious bodily injury to someone else. (veh. code,  2800.3, subd. (a), 2800.1, subd. (a); see calcrim no. 2180.) by pleading no contest to this charge, defendant admitted these elementsnamely, that his unlawful driving proximately caused another person to suffer serious bodily injury. (people v. learnard (2016) 4 cal.app.5th 1117, 1122; people v. guerrero (1988) 44 cal.3d 343, 355 [fact of prior conviction establishes only that defendant committed the least adjudicated elements of the offense].) as we explain below, however, proximately causing great inflicting great bodily injury on a non-accomplice. accordingly, to prove that the prior conviction was a strike offense, the prosecution had to do more than establish defendant admitted the least adjudicated elements of vehicle code section 2800.3. (see people v. eslava (2016) 5 cal.app.5th 498, 515517 (eslava), review granted feb. 15, 2017, s239061 [jury waiver and stipulation to factual basis for plea do not establish or waive jury determination of non-elemental fact].) we conclude the evidence was insufficient to prove that defendant personally inflicted whatever injuries were sustained by the victim in this case, whomever that may have been. first, there is no substantial evidence that defendant injured someone other than an accomplice in his crime of evading the police. the or status, and no evidence was submitted showing that the victim 12 was an innocent bystander or motorist.5 therefore, the prosecution did not prove defendant injured a non-accomplice. (see people v. henley, supra, 72 cal.app.4th at pp. 561562 [prosecutor failed to prove injured party was not an accomplice where neither the plea transcript nor the complaint mentioned the injured partys status, and the prosecutor did not present any evidence to prove that the injured party was not an accomplice].) second, there is no substantial evidence that defendant personally inflicted the injuries. as discussed, defendant admitted that he proximately caused great bodily injurybut [p]roximately causing an injury is clearly different from an injury is to directly cause an injury, not just to proximately people v. bland think it obvious that an individual can and often does proximately cause injury without personally inflicting that injury ibid., emphasis removed; see valenzuela, supra, 191 cal.app.4th at p. great bodily injury does not constitute proof the defendant people v. slough (2017) 11 cal.app.5th 419 [while heroin sale proximately caused overdose victim it was not sufficient to establish personal infliction].) the record before us does not disclose how the victim in this case was injuredor what injured him or her. as such, 5 as discussed, the minute orders were the only documents from the record of conviction presented below. (see eslava, supra, 5 cal.app.5th at p. 508, fn. 5 [listing documents comprising record of conviction]; people v. martinez (2000) 22 cal.4th 106, 117 [rap sheet inadmissible to prove nature or circumstances of prior crime].) 13 there is no factual basis to support a conclusion that defendant directly caused whatever injuries the victim may have suffered. (see valenzuela, supra, 191 cal.app.4th at pp. 322323 [while the bare facts of his plea establish that defendants reckless driving was a volitional act, we have no facts describing the cause of the victims injuries. it could be that the victims were injured when another driver swerved to avoid defendant and that drivers vehicle collided with the victims. in such a case, the other drivers volitional act of swerving out of defendants path would be the direct cause of the victims injuries, though defendants reckless driving would still be the proximate cause.]; people v. wilson (2013) 219 cal.app.4th 500, 513 [elements of gross vehicular manslaughter insufficient to establish personal infliction]; people v. rodriguez (1999) 69 cal.app.4th 341 [proximately causing serious bodily injury while resisting a police officer insufficient to establish personal infliction].) absent additional facts about the crime, substantial evidence does not support the trial courts determination that defendants violation of vehicle code section 2800.3 was a serious felony within the meaning of penal code section 1192.8, subdivision (a).6 2. proceedings on remand as relevant to the proceedings on remand, we have already conviction do not establish that he personally inflicted great 6 because we conclude reversal is required for insufficient that the strike finding violated his sixth amendment rights or the 14 bodily injury on a person other than an accomplice, and we agree with the parties that the current state of the law requires us to let the people try again. (eslava, supra, 5 cal.app.5th at pp. 519520 & fn. 13; people v. barragan (2004) 32 cal.4th 236.) the state and federal high courts appear to disagree, however, about whether defendant has a sixth amendment right to a jury determination of non-elemental facts like those at issue here. the california supreme court has previously determined that a sentencing court may make strike and serious felony determinations based on the entire record of conviction in the prior case. (see, e.g., people v. woodell (1998) 17 cal.4th 448, 454.) in addition, where the alleged strike prior rests on a plea of guilty or no contest, the trial court may examine the record of serious felony under california law. (people v. mcgee (2006) 38 cal.4th 682, 706.) under the federal constitution, not a judge, may find facts that increase a maximum penalty, mathis v. united states (2016) 579 u.s. ___ [136 s.ct. 2243, 2252], citing apprendi v. new jersey (2000) 530 u.s. 466, 490; see also descamps, supra, 133 s.ct. at p. 2288 any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and mathis and descamps whether a prior conviction qualifies as a strike involves judicial fact-finding beyond the elements of the offense, it violates the sixth amendment. (descamps, at p. 2288; see, e.g., eslava, 15 supra, 5 cal.app.5th at pp. 514521; people v. navarette (2016) 4 cal.app.5th 829, 855; people v. mccaw (2016) 1 cal.app.5th 471, 484, review granted oct. 19, 2016, s236618; people v. denard (2015) 242 cal.app.4th 1012, 10301034; people v. marin (2015) 240 cal.app.4th 1344, 13481349, 13621364; people v. saez (2015) 237 cal.app.4th 1177, 11961197, 12051208; people v. wilson, supra, 219 cal.app.4th at p. 515.) on february 17, 2016, the california supreme court granted review in people v. gallardo, s231260 (gallardo), which will reconcile these clashing principles by resolving the following issue: was the trial courts decision that defendants prior conviction constituted a strike incompatible with descamps v. u.s. (2013) 570 u.s. __ [133 s.ct. 2276] because the trial court relied on judicial fact-finding beyond the elements of the actual prior conviction? gallardo was argued and submitted on october 2, 2017. as such, there is uncertainty about which evidentiary issues must be tried to a jury under the sixth amendment in california. because we do not know what evidence the people may ultimately produce to prove the strike allegation, we offer no opinion on what matters a jury must resolve. the trial court will be in the best position to address the issue in light of the specific elections by the people on remand. should the california supreme court issue an opinion in gallardo before the completion of the new priors trial, the trial court should follow gallardo. 16 disposition the judgment is reversed to the extent it is based on a finding that defendant suffered a prior serious felony conviction. the sentence is vacated, and the matter is remanded for further proceedings. the people shall have 30 days after the remittitur is filed to give notice of their intent to retry the strike allegation that defendant was previously convicted of violating vehicle code section 2800.3 and that he personally inflicted great bodily injury on a non-accomplice in the commission of that offense. if the people give such notice, the trial court shall hold a new priors trial limited to those issues and consistent with the views expressed in this opinion. if, before those proceedings are complete, the california supreme court issues an opinion in gallardo, s231260, the court should conduct the proceedings in accordance with gallardo. if the people fail to give notice, fail to prove that defendant was convicted of violating vehicle code section 2800.3, or fail to prove that the conviction was for a serious felony, the court shall enter a not true finding and shall resentence defendant without application of the three strikes law. in all other respects, the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports lavin, j. we concur: edmon, p. j. stone, j.* * judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
