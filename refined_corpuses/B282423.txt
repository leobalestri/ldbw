(c)). the information also alleged that she had been convicted of one prior felony (a 2007 robbery) that constituted both a strike prior ( 667, subds. (b)(j);  1170.12) and a serious-felony prior ( 667, subd. (a)). defendant pled not guilty and denied the allegations. after a bifurcated trial at which she did not testify, the jury found defendant guilty of robbery. while the jury deliberated, defendant waived her right to a jury trial on the prior-conviction allegation. the court later found the allegation true. conviction under people v. superior court (romero) (1996) 13 1 all undesignated statutory references are to the penal code. 3 cal.4th 497, and sentenced her to an aggregate term of seven years in prisonthe low term of two years for the robbery ( 212.5, subd. (c)) plus five years for the serious-felony prior ( 667, subd. (a)), to run consecutively. defendant filed a timely notice of appeal. factual background 1. prosecution evidence the afternoon of october 6, 2016, kee tae kim and his wife were working at their beauty supply store in los angeles. kim was dozing in the back of the store while his wife operated the cash register at the front. around 4:00 p.m., kim woke up and saw defendant walking towards him holding a can of mousse. defendant then picked up two packages of hair extensions and headed to the storage area in the back of the store. kim followed her and saw her pick up a box cutter. kim used the box cutter to break down boxes and typically left it folded in the storage area. kim told defendant to come out of the storage room. she screamed, and kim told his wife to call the police. as defendant emerged from the storage room holding the closed box cutter, kim tried to grab it from her. kim was scared because he had once been shot. defendant pulled away from kim and walked down another aisle towards the cash register near the entrance. kim thought defendant was trying to leave without paying for the merchandise, so he headed to the front door to block her exitmerchandise she was holding in an attempt to take the box cutter 4 from her.2 defendant resisted, and a struggle ensued. the mousse, hair extensions, and box cutter fell to the ground. sometime during this altercation, defendant scratched make any contact with him, but he explained that he meant defendant never tried to stab him or hurt himshe was only being defensive after he hit the items out of her hands. police arrived during the struggle. as los angeles police department officer sonia dibell approached the store, she saw kim struggling with someone; both people appeared to be her partner entered the store, handcuffed defendant, and escorted her to the back of a police car. defendant was screaming defendant was carrying $94.94 at the time of her arrest. the mousse and hair extensions cost a total of about $25. 2. defense evidence forensic psychologist dr. ann walker performed a clinical evaluation of defendant after her arrest. defendant told walker about her upbringing, background, and history of trauma. 2 kim testified at the preliminary hearing that he could not tell whether the box cutter was open or closed at this point; at trial, he testified that the box cutter blade was either out or that defendant was simply holding it. 5 walker diagnosed defendant with schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder. walker explained that when a person with extreme ptsd and schizophrenia is struck or grabbed unexpectedly, the person will not in this the person may scream and hit to protect herself from perceived dangers. after watching surveillance video of defendant, walker opined that her behavior was consistent with that of a person suffering from ptsd and schizoaffective disorder. discussion defendant contends that there is no substantial evidence to support the force/fear element of robbery, that the court erroneously admitted evidence of her two prior misdemeanor theft convictions, that counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to request a limiting instruction, and that we should vacate her sentence and remand for the court to exercise its new sentencing discretion under senate bill no. 1393. 1. sufficiency of the evidence of force or fear a criminal defendant may not be convicted of any crime unless the prosecution proves every fact necessary for conviction beyond a reasonable doubt. (u.s. const., 5th & 14th amends.; cal. const., art. i,  7, 15; in re winship (1970) 397 u.s. 358, 364; people v. tenner (1993) 6 cal.4th 559, 566.) principltenner, at p. 566) is so fundamental to the american system of justice that criminal irrationality or error by the independent review of the sufficiency of the evidence undertaken by the trial and appellate courts.6 (united states v. powell (1984) 469 u.s. 57, 67.) defendant contends there is insufficient evidence of force or fear to support her conviction for second degree robbery. we conclude that the evidence here is legally sufficient. 1.1. standard of review in assessing the sufficiency of the evidence to support a conviction, we review the entire record to determine whether any rational trier of fact could have found the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. (people v. albillar (2010) 51 cal.4th 47, 5960.) support the verdicti.e., evidence that is reasonable, credible, and of solid valuesuch that a reasonable trier of fact could find the defendant guilty beyond a re (people v. zamudio (2008) 43 cal.4th 327, 357.) in applying this test, we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution and presume in support of the judgment the existence of every fact the jury could reasonably deduce from the evidence. (people v. kraft (2000) 23 cal.4th 978, 1053.) deference is not abdication, however, and substantial evidence is not synonymous with any evidence. (people v. johnson (1980) 26 cal.3d 557, 576577.) decision supported by a mere scintilla of evidence need not be affirmed on appeal.[citation.] although substantial evidence may consist of inferences, those inferences must be products of logic and reason and must be based on the evidence.in re james r.

(people v. anderson, supra, 51 cal.4th at p. 994.) thus, a defendant who does not use force or fear when she first takes the property may nonetheless be guilty of robbery if she uses force or fear to keep it people v. gomez, supra, 43 cal.4th at pp. 256, 264.) 1.3. there is substantial evidence that defendant used force while carrying the property away. defendant contends there is no substantial evidence to she used force or fear to obtain or attempt to keep the hair extensions and mousse. after reviewing the transcript and videos in this case, we agree that there is no substantial evidence defendant used force or fear when she exited the storage room.3 we conclude, however, that there is substantial evidence she forcibly resisted to regain his property at the store entrance. based on the video, the jurors could conclude that defendant used some level of force not just to protect herself but also to escape with the hair extensions and mousse. as defendant approached the front of the store, kim tried to take the merchandise from her hands. defendant then swung her body around and hugged the items to her chest as kim continued to grab at his property. with her back to kim, defendant successfully held on to the items for a few seconds before they fell 3 out of the storage room is supported neither by the transcript pages they cite nor by the video evidence. 9 to the floor. this was sufficient.

(college hospital inc., at p. 715people v. vasquez (2017) 14 cal.app.5th 1019, 1041.) here, defendant does not explain why or how the asserted error prejudiced her.6 accordingly, she has not carried her burden on appeal. 6 defendant briefly addresses the issue in her reply brief, noting that 12 3. failure to request a limiting instruction defendant argues that her attorney provided constitutionally ineffective assistance by failing to request an instruction thefts.7 we find no constitutional violation. 3.1. legal principles under either the federal or state constitution, the benchmark for judging any claim of ineffectiveness must be o undermined the proper functioning of the adversarial process that the trial cannot be relied on as having produced a just result.(strickland v. washington (1984) 466 u.s. 668, 686 (strickland).) to establish ineffective assistance of counsel, defendant must satisfy two requirements. (id. at pp. 690692.) first, she must show her outside the wide range of professionally competent assistance. (strickland, supra, 466 u.s. at p. 690.) then, she must demonstrate the deficient performance was prejudiciali.e., the result of the proceeding would have been different. (id. at p. 694.) it is not sufficient to show the alleged errors may have as propensity evidence. as we have discussed, however, there was sufficient evidence to support the robbery conviction. 7 defendant does not appear to argue that counsel should have requested such an instruction about the felony priors. nor does defendant argue that counsel was ineffective for mentioning that the misdemeanors were theft- 13 had some conceivable effect on must demonstrate a reasonable probability that absent the errors the result would have been different. (people v. mesa (2006) 144 cal.app.4th 1000, 1008.) petition for writ of habeas corpus [citation], where relevant facts and circumstances not reflected in the record on appeal, such as (people v. snow appellate counsel will consider it advisable to raise the issue on direct appeal. there may be instances, too, when obvious deficiencies in representation will be addressed by an appellate court sua spontemassaro v. united states (2003) 538 u.s. 500, 508.) but those cases are rare. acted or failed to act in the challenged manner, we must reject the claim on appeal unless counsel was asked for and failed to provide a satisfactory explanation, or there simply can be no people v. scott (1997) 15 cal.4th 1188, 1212.) these arguments should instead be raised on collateral review. (people v. mendoza tello (1997) 15 cal.4th 264, 266267.) 3.2. counsel had tactical reasons not to request the instruction. failure to request a limiting instruction is not necessarily evidence of incompetence. here, for example, a attorney may have tactically concluded that the risk of a limiting instruction ... outweighed the questionable benefits such 14 people v. hernandez (2004) 33 cal.4th 1040, 1053.) the testimony about defendants prior criminal conduct was exceedingly brief and did not affect . moreover, the substance of the prior crimes was revealed only in the questionswhich the jury was explicitly instructed not to consider as evidence. under the circumstances, defense counsel may have deemed it unwise to call further attention to defendants criminal history by requesting an instruction on it. (see people v. hinton (2006) 37 cal.4th 839, 878; hernandez, at p. 1053.) here, the decision not to [the] broad range of trial tactics that we may not second-(people v. riel (2000) 22 cal.4th 1153, 1197.) performance was not deficient. 4. resentencing is required. in response to our request for supplemental briefing, defendant contends we must remand for the trial court to exercise its newly-acquired sentencing discretion under senate bill no. 1393. (sen. bill no. 1393 (20172018 reg. sess.); stats. 2018, ch. 1013,  12.) the people properly concede the point, and we agree. when defendant was sentenced in this case, the court had to strike any prior conviction of a serious felony for purposes of enhancement [of a sentence] under section 667. ( 1385, subd. (b); people v. jones (1993) 12 cal.app.4th 1106, 11161117.) thus, though the court could (and did) strike under romero, supra, 13 cal.4th 497, it imposed a five-year enhancement for the same prior conviction under section 667, subdivision (a). 15 after briefing was complete in this appeal, the california legislature passed, and the governor signed, senate bill no. 1393, which went into effect on january 1, 2019. (sen. bill no. 1393 (20172018 reg. sess.); people v. camba (1996) 50 cal.app.4th 857, 865 [effective date of non-urgency legislation].) the bill amended section 667, subdivision (a), and section 1385, subdivision (b), to allow a court to exercise its discretion to strike or dismiss a serious-felony prior for sentencing purposes. (stats. 2018, ch. 1013,  12.) legislation which vests trial courts with discretion, which they formerly did not have, to dismiss or strike a prior serious felony conviction people v. garcia (2018) 28 cal.app.5th 961, 972.) as such, senate bill no. 1393 applies retroactively to all cases, such as this one, that were not final when it took effect.
