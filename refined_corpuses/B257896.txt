answered and was arrested. on may 12, 2013, detective jamie yamasaki interviewed j.b. telephonically. j.b. repeated what she had told deputy estrella, and also stated that appellant had raped her. a few days later, detective yamasaki met with j.b. and took photographs of the bruises on her legs. er salena carter testified on his behalf. she stated that she did not see any injuries on j.b. during

that he had been employed in various jobs throughout his ten-year relationship with j.b. he never hit j.b. or called her names. about a year after their relationship began, j.b. became a heavy

vegas began when j.b. became inebriated, called him names, grabbed a knife from the kitchen and ran at him. appellant took the knife away from her, but she then bit and kicked him. he bit back in self-defense. the neighbors called the police. appellant pled guilty to a misdemeanor because he wanted to be released quickly so that he could be with his daughter. appellant did not tell the police about the knife because he did not want j.b. to go to jail. appellant denied that he hit j.b. on april 2, 2013, in los angeles. he stated that j.b. received the black eye earlier when they were still living in las vegas. there, j.b. argued with an unidentified woman on the way to the liquor store, and the woman hit her. appellant testified that he was never contacted by the police about the incident. 5 according to appellant, the scratching incident which formed the basis of the count 1 corporal injury charge occurred on thursday, may 9, 2013. j.b. went out to a club with her sister and returned drunk. she urinated on herself, then threw a backpack at appellant when he tried to ask her questions about her evening. she tried to scratch him, but he grabbed her arms and restrained her.

insulting each other. j.b. threw a backpack at him. he grabbed her arms in an attempt to calm her down, scratching her arms in the process. they continued to drink until 7:00 or 8:00 p.m., when j.b. left the house and did not return. 6 discussion 1. calcrim no. 362 the court instructed the jury with calcrim no. 362, which permits the jury to the crime. appellant contends the trial court erred in giving this instruction because there was no evidentiary basis for it and it violated his right to a fair trial. appellant did not object to calcrim no. 362 on any ground. accordingly we review the instruction only to determine if it affected his substantial rights. (pen. code,  1259.) it did not. a. instruction calcrim no. 362 as given provided: misleading statement before this trial relating to the charged crime, knowing the statement was false or intending to mislead, that conduct may show he was aware of his guilt of the crime and you may consider it in determining his guilt. [] if you conclude that the defendant made the statement, it is up to you to decide its meaning and importance. however, evidence that the defendant made such a statement cannot prove there is no discussion of this instruction in the record. b. constitutional challenges appellant contends the instruction violated his state and federal rights to due process, an impartial jury, and a presumption of innocence. appellant acknowledges that the california supreme court has repeatedly rejected constitutional challenges to caljic no. 2.03, the predecessor instruction to calcrim no. 362. (see people v. howard (2008) 42 cal.4th 1000, 1025.) he indicates that he makes these claims to preserve them for federal review. appellant specifically contends the instruction was improper because it was not accompanied by an instruction telling the jury that other evidence might be indicative of innocence. the california supreme court has held that a defendant has no right to such an instruction. (people v. green (1980) 27 cal.3d 1, 38 [holding that defendant has no 7 right to instruction that the fact that defendant did not flee was evidence indicating innocence].) he also contends the jury instruction contains a permissive inference which violates the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment, is an improper pinpoint instruction, offense is in dispute. the california supreme court has rejected these claims when used to challenge caljic no. 2.03, the predecessor instruction to calcrim no. 362. (people v. ashmus (1991) 54 cal.3d 932, 977 [permissive inference]; people v. kelly (1992) 1 cal.4th 495, 531-532 [pinpoint instruction]; people v. breaux (1991) 1 cal.4th 281, 304 [mental state].) we agree with our colleagues in the third district court of lthough there are minor differences between caljic no. 2.03 and calcrim no. 362 . . . none is sufficient to undermine our suprems approval of the language of these instructions.people v. mcgowan (2008) 160 cal.app.4th 1099, 1104.) accordingly, we are bound to follow to follow the decisions of our supreme court. (auto equity sales, inc. v. superior court (1962) 57 cal.2d 450, 455.) c. evidentiary claim appellant contends the trial court erred in instructing the jury with calcrim no. 362 because there was no evidentiary basis for it. he claims there is no significant difference between his pretrial statement to police and his testimony at trial, and so no evidence that the pretrial statement was false apart from j.b.2 appellant focuses on the portion of his pretrial statement which describes the details of the scratching incident. however, appellant also discussed j.b.the scratching incident, claiming that she left after the incident and never returned. although there was no discussion of calcrim no. 362 at all during trial, the j.b. left after the scratching incident. during closing argument, the prosecutor stated, 2 to the extent that appellant contends that calcrim no. 362 is inapplicable to al statements to police and his trial testimony are consistent, appellant is mistaken. (people v. kimble (1988) 44 cal.3d 480, 498.) 8 ve that for 36 hours from may 10th at 1:30 p.m. when he last sees his three-year old daughter get on the bus with the violent, unpredictable, raging alcoholic and not return for 36 hours, that he does nothing, except send one text. that is this is the only statement by appellant relating to the current charges that the prosecutor directly argued was false. j.b. left after the scratching incident is a denial that he raped and injured j.b. on may 11. it suggests that someone else committed those crimes. if false, it would support giving calcrim no. 362. pretrial statement about j.b. al statement an extremely intoxicated j.b. left home one night and never returned, yet he did nothing at all about the disappearance of the mother (and historically the primary caretaker) of his daughter. further, there were significant differences between j.b.the pretrial version, j.b. left alone the night of the incident. at trial, she left the next day with her daughter. based on these differences, a jury could find both statements to be fabrications. thus, there was an evidentiary basis for calcrim no. 362. 2. section 1109 pursuant to section 1109, the trial court permitted the admission of multiple prior uncharged assaults and rapes of j.b. by appellant over a ten year period. 3 appellant contends the admission of this propensity evidence under section 1109 deprived him of equal protection and his due process right to a fair trial. 3 evidence code section 110xcept as provided in subdivision (e) or (f), in a criminal action in which the defendant is accused of an offense violence is not made inadmissible by section 1101 if the evidence is not inadmissible pursuant to section 352. 9 respondent contends that appellant has forfeited these claims by failing to object to the evidence on constitutional grounds. (see people v. burgener (2003) 29 cal.4th 833, 869 [claim that improper admission of evidence violated due process waived by failure to raise it in trial court].) respondent is correct. however, even assuming that appellant has preserved his claims, it is well settled under california law that section a. due process appellant contends that section 1109 violates due process because it renders a trial fundamentally unfair. appellant acknowledges that the california supreme court has held that section 1108, which permits the admission sexual offenses when he is on trial for a sexual offense, satisfies due process because it requires that a defendant be given pretrial notice of the offenses to be used and gives the trial court discretion to exclude evidence under section 352 if its prejudicial potential outweighs its probative value. (people v. falsetta (1999) 21 cal.4th 903, 917-918 (falsetta).) as appellant also acknowledges, california courts have relied on the reasoning of falsetta to uniformly reject due process challenges to section 1109. (see people v. johnson (2010) 185 cal.app.4th 520, 529; people v. williams (2008) 159 cal.app.4th 141, 146-147; people v. cabrera (2007) 152 cal.app.4th 695, 703-704; people v. escobar (2000) 82 cal.app.4th 1085, 1095-1096; people v. jennings (2000) 81 cal.app.4th 1301, 1310-1311 (jennings); people v. brown (2000) 77 cal.app.4th 1324, 1331-1334; people v. hoover (2000) 77 cal.app.4th 1020, 1025-1030.) appellant asks us to find that the reasoning of falsetta should not be applied to section 1109 in light of subsequent intermediate federal court opinions, particularly garceau v. woodford (9th cir. 2001) 275 f.3d 769. even if we were free to depart from the reasoning of falsetta with respect to section 1109, we would not do so. we agree with the reasoning of the courts of appeal in the cases cited above. in particular, we agree that section 352 provides a realistic safeguard that ensures that the 10 presumption of innocence and other characteristics of due process are not weakened by an unfair use of evidence of past acts. (people v. harris (1998) 60 cal.app.4th 727, 730people v. brown, supra, 77 cal.app.4th 1324, 1334.) further, several federal circuit courts of appeal, including the ninth circuit, have found admission of uncharged sex crimes in sex offense cases is not a violation of due process. federal rules of evidence 413 and 414 permit the admission of evidence of uncharged sexual assaults in sexual offense cases and uncharged child molestation incidents in child molestation cases. (see united states v. lemay (9th cir. 2001) 260 f.3d 1018, 1026-1027; united states v. castillo (10th cir. 1998) 140 f.3d 874, 881; united states v. enjady (10th cir. 1998) 134 f.2d 1427, 1430-1435; united states v. mound (8th cir. 1998) 149 f.3d 799, 800-802; kerr v. caspari (8th cir. 1992) 956 f.2d 788, 790.) this same reasoning applies to section 1109 and domestic violence offenses. section 1109 does not violate b. equal protection appellant contends section 1109 violates the equal protection clause. appellant acknowledges that at least two appellate courts have rejected an equal protection claim to section 1109. (people v. price (2004) 120 cal.app.4th 224, 240-241; jennings, supra, 81 cal.app.4th at pp. 1310-1313.) he argues the reasoning in those cases is flawed. a statutory law violates the equal protection clause when it arbitrarily treats similarly situated individuals differently. (people v. romo (1975) 14 cal.3d 189, 196.) we will assume for the sake of argument that defendants charged with domestic violence offenses are similarly situated to all other criminal defendants. because, as we discuss above, section 1109 does not violate due process, it satisfies equal protection (jennings, supra, 81 cal.app.4th at p. 1312.) as appellant acknowledges, the legitimate state purpose behind section 1109 is the prosecution of domestic violence offenses. however, he contends that section 1109 is both an over-inclusive and an under-inclusive means chosen by the legislature to advance 11 that purpose. appellant does not dispute that domestic violence crimes, like sexual offenses, are committed in secret and often involve credibility issues. he argues that section 1109 is both over-inclusive because it is not limited to domestic violence cases where there are no witnesses and under-inclusive because it does not apply to other crimes which are committed in secret without witnesses. we agree with the court in jennings that like sex crimedomestic violence is quintessentially a secretive offense, shrouded in private shame, embarrassment and ambivalence on the part of the victim, as well as intimacy with and intimidation by the perpetrator. the special relationship between victim and perpetrator in both domestic violence and sexual abuse cases, with their unusually private and intimate context, easily distinguishes these offenses from the broad variety of criminal conduct in general. although all criminal trials are credibility contests to some extent, this is unusually -- even inevitably -- so in domestic and sexual abuse cases, specifically with respect to the issue of victim credibility. the legislature could rationally distinguish between these two kinds of cases and all other criminal offenses in permitting the admissibility of previous like offenses in order to assist in more realistically adjudging the unavoidable credibility contest between accuser and accused. the fact that other crimes such as murder and mayhem may be more serious and that credibility contests are not confined to domestic violence cases do not demonstrate the absence of the required rational basis for s distinction between these crimes.jennings, supra, 81 cal.app.4th at p. 1313.) 3. motion for a new trial appellant moved for a new trial on the ground that his counsel was ineffective in failing to impeach j.b. with a prior conviction. he contends the trial court erred in denying this motion. 12 a. applicable law a motion for a new trial is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. (people v. rodrigues (1994) 8 cal.4th 1060, 1124.) a trial court abuses its in a manifest miscaibid.) in order to establish ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant must show that s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness, and that, s error, a different result would have been reasonably probable. (strickland v. washington (1984) 466 u.s. 668, 687-688, 694; people v. ledesma (1987) 43 cal.3d 171, 216-a reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to under (strickland v. washington, supra, 466 u.s. at p. 694.) when an appellant makes an ineffective assistance claim on appeal, we look to see if the record contains any explanation for the challenged aspects of the representation. if the record is silent, then the contention musunless counsel was asked for an explanation and failed to provide one, or unless there simply could be no satisfactory explanation (people v. haskett (1990) 52 cal.3d 210, 248.) [a] court must indulge a strong presumption s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance; that is, the defendant must overcome the presumption that, under the circumstances, the challenged action might be considered sound trial (people v. thomas (1992) 2 cal.4th 489, 530-531.) in denying the motion for a new trial, the court stated, with the grand theft conviction, i have been on the bench doing this for 16 y, tactical 13 decision because he -- about it. . . . he knew. . . . the trial court also found that appellant was not a sympathetic witness, j.b. had corroboration for some of her claims and the use of the conviction to impeach j.b. c. analysis appellant contends the trial court abused its discretion in finding that his trial counsel might have had a tactical reason for not impeaching j.b. appellant argues that this case was almost entirely a credibility contest between him and j.b., his counsel vigorously attacked j.b. during cross-examination and so would not have forgone using the conviction to impeach j.b. for tactical reasons. appellant implies that his counsel had memory or organizational challenges and forgot to impeach j.b. we agree with the trial court that a defense counsel may well forgo impeaching a sympathetic witness with a prior conviction as a tactical matter. appellanttrial counsel did attack j.b. although it is possible that counsel decided during cross-examination that his credibility attack was not being received favorably by the jury and so abandoned the use of the prior conviction, we will assume for the sake of argument that counsel did not have a tactical reason for his failure to use the conviction. we agree with the trial court it is not reasonably probable that appellant would have received a more favorable result if j.b. had been impeached with her prior theft-related conviction. as the trial court pointed out, j.b. was a very sympathetic witness. there is no doubt that she was brutally attacked by someone in may 2013. photographs of some of her injuries were shown at trial. j.b. was living with appellant at the time of the offenses in this case. in contrast to j.b., appellant was not a sympathetic witness. his defense to the may 11 rape and corporal injury charges was that j.b. left home before the time those incidents supposedly occurred. as we discuss above in section 1, appellant gave two different versions of j.b.er was particularly believable. further, the record does not provide any evidence of who, apart from appellant, might have attacked 14 j.b., or why she would lie about the identity of her attacker. to the contrary, the record shows that j.b. had a long history of either trying to cover it up. in this case, she was compelled by her mother to report the abuse. there is no reasonable probability that the jury would have found j.b. not credible about the abuse if it had known about her prior conviction and thus no reasonable probability that appellant would have received a more favorable result if the conviction had been introduced. disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports kirschner, j. we concur: turner, p.j. kriegler, j. judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
