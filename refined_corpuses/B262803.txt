(b)); (2) felony evasion of a peace officer (veh. code,  2800.2, subd. (a)); and (3) possession of a firearm as a previously convicted felon (former  12021, subd. (a)(1), now  29800, subd. (a)(1).)2 the court sentenced him to a total term of 6 years plus 77 years to life in prison under the three strikes law. (see people v. underwood (feb. 25, 2010, b212973, at p. 7 [nonpub. opn.] (underwood i).)3 underwood appealed, but the appellate court sentence. (underwood i, at pp. 1, 19.)4 underwood petitioned the supreme court for review, but the supreme court denied review. proposition 36, the three strikes reform act of 2012, underwood filed a petition for 1 undesignated statutory references are to the penal code. 2 references to the charge of possession of a firearm as a previously convicted felon will be referred to as section 29800 offenses because the substance of the statute did not change when it was amended. 3 the parties did not submit a complete record in this case due to the limited scope of issues on appeal. 4 this court upheld underwoconviction but ordered the trial court to issue an amended abstract of judgment to give underwood 1,945 days of presentence credit and to acknowledge (underwood i, supra, b212973, at p. 19.) 3 recall of his sentence under section 1170.126. the lower court held that because 1192.7, subdivision (c)(31), he was ineligible for resentencing on all three counts under section 1170.126, subdivision (e)(2). w resentencing petition was pending before the trial court, the california supreme court had not yet decided johnson; it issued johnson about a month after the lower (johnson, supra, 61 cal.4th 674.) in johnson, the supreme court held that defendants are eligible for resentencing on any qualifying counts, even if they are ineligible for resentencing on unqualified counts. (at pp. 687688.) underwood appealed encing petition. discussion on appeal, underwood argues his evasion and possession counts are eligible for resentencing under johnson because they are non-serious felonies which are not otherwise disqualifying under sections 1170.126, subdivision (e)(2), 667, subdivision (e)(2)(c)(iii), and 1170.12, subdivision (c)(2)(c)(iii). ( 1170.126, subd. (e)(2), 667, the commission of the current offense, the defendant . . . was armed with a firearm or underwood further contends we cannot hold he event, for the section 29800, subdivision (a)(1) possession charge as a matter of statutory interpretation. underwood is correct that, under johnson, it was error as a matter of law for the court to deny his petition for resentencing on all counts because his assault charge was a serious felony under section 1192.7, subdivision (c)(31). (johnson, supra, 61 cal.4th at p. 688.) we agree with the attorney general, however, that evasion and possession counts remain ineligible for resentencing because he was armed under sections 667, subdivision (e)(2)(c)(iii) and 1170.12, subdivision (c)(2)(c)(iii). we affirm. 4 a. sections 667, subdivision (e)(2)(c)(iii) and 1170.12, subdivision (c)(2)(c)(iii), rendering his evasion and possession counts ineligible for resentencing underwood claims we must remand resentencing to the lower court because determining wheth would require us to impermissibly decide a newbased on evidence outside the record of conviction. although the california supreme court has not comprehensively defined courts of appeal have consistently held that in the three strikes context people v. myers (1993) 5 cal.4th 1193, 1195; see people v. bartow (1996) 46 cal.app.4th 1573, 1580; people v. woodell (1998) 17 cal.4th 448, 454455.) in underwood i, the appellate court reported that at trial, two police officers testified they pistol grip underwood i, supra, b212973, at p. 3.) underwood does not cite to any cases challenging an appellate court using trial transcripts or a previous appellate opinion to determine whether a defendant was ; the cases he does cite to as a challenge to our use of the record are inapplicable because they address portions of the record not at issue here. (see, e.g., people v. berry (2015) 235 cal.app.4th 1417 [use of preliminary hearing transcript and probation report was improper to establish conduct necessary for 1170.126, subdivision (e)(2) purposes where charges alleging that conduct were dismissed].) thus, the court correctly found, based on the above evidence, at issue. underwood argues that even if the record of conviction could allow a fact finder to armed while committing the offense, the record does not clearly establish the jury actually determined he was armed. for resentencing purposes, however, courts have held that conduct under sections 667 and 1170.12 need not be pleaded, proved, or clearly found by a jury to render counts ineligible for sentencing. 5 (people v. blakely (2014) 225 cal.app.4th 1042, 1058; see also people v. osuna (2014) 225 cal.app.4th 1020, 1033 (osuna).) as a pointed example, in a case where the underlying count was a section 29800 possession charge, one appellate court factually determined a defendant was s 667, subdivision (e)(2)(c)(iii) and 1170.12, subdivision (c)(2)(c)(iii) purposes based on a prior appellate car (osuna, at p. 1030.) based on this case law, finding underwood given the evidence at bar of his conduct underlying the charges does not require us to impermissibly determine a disputed issue of fact, as underwood argues. (see blakely, at p. 1058; people v. mcgee (2006) 38 cal.4th 682, 691692, quoting people v. guerrero to allow the trier of fact to look to the entire record of the conviction is certainly reasonable see also people v. wilson (2013) 219 cal.app.4th 500, 516 [unlike here, appellate resolution of sentencing about whether defendant caused element of .) we therefore sed on the record of conviction. b. section 29800, subdivision (a)(1) possession counts underwood additionally argues that as a matter of statutory interpretation, a a section 29800, subdivision (a)(1) felon in possession charge. a body of case law addressing this statutory interpretation issue refutes his contention. (people v. white (2014) 223 cal.app.4th 512, 524526 [convicted felon carrying revolver during current offense osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1030; people v. elder for purposes of section 1170.126, unlawful possession of a firearm can constitute being armed during an offensepeople v. brimmer (2014) 230 cal.app.4th 782, 792793 exclusion dictates ineligibility if defendant was current offense]; people v. hicks (2014) 231 cal.app.4th 275, 284 [likewise finding the .) underwood provided no 6 contrary cites. we agree that under the plain language of the armed with a firearm exclusion, [a] defendant is ineligible for resentencing relief as a second strike offender if his life imposed because [d]uring the commission of the current offense, [he] used a firearm, [or] was armed with a firearm.(brimmer, at p. 792793.) as described above, therefore to refuse to remand for resentencing. disposition the order is affirmed. not to be published. lui, j. we concur: rothschild, p. j. chaney, j.
