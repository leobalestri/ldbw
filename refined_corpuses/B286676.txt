(people v. smith, supra, b250674, pp. 1-2.) in 2013, a jury found smith guilty of two counts of assault with a firearm (pen. code,  245, subd. (a)(2))4 and two counts of battery causing serious bodily injury ( 243, subd. (d)). the jury also found true the special enhancement allegations that, in the commission of the assaults with a firearm, smith personally inflicted great bodily injury ( 12022.7, subd. (a)) and, in the commission of all offenses, smith personally used a firearm ( 12022.5, subd. (a)). (people v. smith, supra, b250674, p. 2.) after waiving jury trial on prior conviction allegations, the trial court found true that smith had two prior convictions for serious or violent felonies within the meaning of the three strikes law ( 667, subds. (b)-(i) & 1170.12, subds. (a)-(d)), two prior serious felony convictions within the meaning of section 667, subdivision (a)(1), and had served two prior prison terms within the meaning of section 667.5, subdivision (b). (people v. smith, supra, b250674, p. 4.) initial sentencing hearing on july 1, 2013, the trial court held the initial sentencing hearing in this matter.5 at the outset, the court heard and people v. superior court (romero) (1996) 13 cal.4th 497. smith argued the court should dismiss one of his prior strike convictions because they both arose from the same criminal case and involved the same course of conduct. 4 further statutory references are to the penal code. 5 motion, we augmented the 1, 2013 sentencing hearing. 4 in denying the motion, thistory since the time he was convicted of the two prior strike offenses in 1998 appear to be someone who is in that pattern of the revolving door the trial court sentenced smith to 81 years to life in prison: on count 2 for assault with a firearm (deemed the base count), 25 years to life under the three strikes law, plus consecutive terms of 10 years (the high term) for the firearm enhancement, three years for the great bodily injury enhancement, five years for each of the two prior serious felony enhancements, and one year for the prior prison term enhancement;6 and on count 1 for assault with a firearm, 25 years to life under the three strikes law, plus consecutive terms of four years (the midterm) for the firearm enhancement and three years for the great bodily injury enhancement. in selecting the high term on the firearm enhancement in counconsidering all of the circumstances in aggravation in this case, including, but not limited to, the fact that this crime involved great violence, great bodily harm, and the threat of great bodily harm and acts disclosing a high degree of cruelty, viciousness or callousness. [] i do find that the victims in this case, based on how the crime was committed, were in a particularly vulnerable state and were basically ambushed by the defendant. i do note 6 the trial court struck the other prior prison term allegation because the prior conviction on which it was based was used to enhance (a)(1) and the three strikes law. 5 that the defendant has engaged in violent conduct, which does in imposing consecutive terms on counts 1 and 2, the trial separate attacks. the way the testimony came out at trial, after the attack on mr. howard, as mr. howard was basically trying to leave, then the attack to mrs. howard began. he had to come back to rescue his wife. so two violent crimes committed against multiple victims. these are two distinct acts against two distinct victims. given thaconvictions are numerous and of increasing seriousness, the fact that the defendant was on parole at the time the crime was committed, i choose to serve these two sentences consecutively if there is any discre the trial court then imposed and stayed under section 654 the sentence on the two counts for battery causing great bodily injury (counts 4 & 5), finding the offenses arose from the same set of operative facts as counts 1 and 2. for each battery, the court imposed and stayed 25 years to life under the three strikes law, plus a consecutive four years (the midterm) for the firearm enhancement. on january 9, 2015, this court affirmed the judgment against smith, ordering the trial court to correct clerical errors. (people v. smith, supra, b250674, p. 11.) resentencing hearing smith filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the california supreme court (case no. s232701). the court issued an order to show cause returnable before the trial court. on september 17, 2017, the trial court granted the petition without 6 an evidentiary hearing. the court found, under the reasoning in people v. vargas (2014) 59 cal.4convictions for robbery and carjacking, which arose from the same criminal case, could not both be used as prior strikes under span of time, with a single objective of taking property from the the court concluded smith was entitled to a new sentencing hearing. at an october 17, 2017 hearing, the trial court set aside e and resentenced him to 36 years and four months in prison: on count 2 for assault with a firearm (the base count), the high term of four years, doubled to eight years under the three strikes law, plus consecutive terms of 10 years (the high term) for the firearm enhancement, three years for the great bodily injury enhancement, five years for each of the two prior serious felony enhancements, and one year for the prior prison term enhancement;7 and on count 1 for assault with a firearm, one year (one-third the midterm of three years), doubled to two years under the three strikes law, plus consecutive terms of one year and four months (one-third the midterm of four years) on the firearm enhancement and one year (one-third the term of three years) for the great bodily injury enhancement. 7 as set forth above, at the initial sentencing hearing, the trial court struck the other prior prison term allegation because the prior conviction on which it was based was used to enhance three strikes law. at the resentencing hearing, the court indicated that this other prior prison term enhancement remained stricken. 7 in selecting the high term on the firearm enhancement in couninal sentencing, i had stated all of the factors in aggravation justifying the imposition of the trial court then imposed and stayed under section 654 the sentence on the two counts for battery causing great bodily injury (counts 4 & 5). for each battery, the court imposed and stayed the high term of four years for the offense, doubled to eight years under the three strikes law, plus a consecutive 10 years (the high term) for the firearm enhancement. discussion section 12022.5 firearm enhancements in october 2017, the legislature amended section 12022.5 to provide section 1385 and at the time of sentencing, strike or dismiss an en( 12022.5, subd. (c); stats. 2017, ch. 682,  21.)8 the amendment went into effect on january 1, 2018, before the judgment of smithsubd. (c).) smith contends, the attorney general concedes, and case. (see people v. francis (1969) 71 cal.2d 66, 75-76 [where statute enacted during pending appeal gave trial court discretion to impose lesser penalty, remand was required for resentencing].) smith contends the amendment requires the trial court be given an opportunity to exercise its new discretion to strike the 8 under section 1385, the court may, in furtherance of justice, & (c); see people v. meloney (2003) 30 cal.4th 1145, 1155.) 8 firearm enhancement imposed as part of his sentence. the attorney general argues remand for resentencing is not required in this case because [w]hen the record shows that the trial court proceeded with sentencing on the . . . assumption it lacked discretion, remand is necessary so that the trial court may have the opportunity to exercise its sentencing discretion at a new sentencing hearing. [citations.] defendants are entitled to sentencing decisions made in the and a court that is unaware of its discretionary authority cannot exercise its informed [citation.] the record shows that the trial court would not have exercised its discretion even if it believed it could do so, then remand would be an idle act and is not requiredpeople v. mcdaniels (2018) 22 cal.app.5th 420, 425.) in people v. gutierrez (1996) 48 cal.app.4th 1894, 1896, the trial court increased the defendanbelieved the three strikes law required, by imposing the high term and two additional discretionary one-year enhancements. the court stated during sentencing that imposing the maximum sentence would be appropriate. (ibid.) on appeal, the defendant requested that his case be remanded to the trial court for resentencing after our supreme court decided in people v. superior court (romero), supra, 13 cal.4th 497 that a trial court has discretion to strike prior strikes in determinsentence. the appellate court denied the request, noting that because the trial court had indicated both in its comments and by the sentence itself that a maximum sentence was appropriate, 9 gutierrez, at p. 1896.) during the initial sentencing hearing in gutierrez, the this is the kind of individual the law was intended to keep off the street as long as it would not have exercised its discretion to lessen the sentence. (ibid.) light of [senate bill no.] 620, clearly indicated when it originally sentenced the defendant that (people v. mcdaniels, supra, 22 cal.app.5th at p. 425.) sentencing, the trial court had no discretion to strike the firearm enhancement and did not indicate how it would exercise such discretion if available. notwithstanding that, the attorney general argues remand is not necessary because the -term firearm enhancements for the principal determinate term and the stayed offenses, selection of upper-term sentences for the non-subordinate substantive offenses, selection of consecutive establish a clear indication that the court would not strike any the fact the trial court imposed a longer prison term than required does not necessarily mean the court would have declined to strike the enhancement if, at the time of the hearing, section 12022.5 afforded the court such discretion. moreover, because the law at the time of sentencing did not allow the trial court to strike firearm enhancements, smith had 10 no reason to argue the court should strike his enhancement. as our supreme court explained in a somewhat similar circumstance in people v. rodriguez (1998) 17 cal.4th 253, 258, his counsel have never enjoyed a full and fair opportunity to marshal and present the case supporting a favorable exercise of ibid. [requiring the presence of defendant and counsel at a hearing in which the court would determine whether it could reasonably exercise its discretion to strike a prior strike].) for these reasons, we remand the matter for the trial court to determine whether to strike the firearm enhancement. section 667 prior serious felony enhancements on september 30, 2018, the governor signed senate bill no. 1393 which, effective january 1, 2019, amends sections 667, subdivision (a) and 1385, subdivision (b) to give trial courts discretion to strike or dismiss prior serious felony enhancements. (stats. 2018, ch. 1013,  1-2.) smith argues, the attorney general concedes, and we agree the new legislation applies conviction was not final as of january 1, 2019, the effective date of senate bill no. 1393. (people v. garcia (2018) 28 cal.app.4th 961, 971-972.)9 9 y filed in november 2018, prior to the january 1, 2019 effective date of the legislation. we are deciding this appeal after january 11 in his supplemental brief, smith contends the amendment requires the trial court in his case be given an opportunity to exercise its new discretion to strike the five-year prior serious felony enhancements imposed as part of his sentence. the indicated that it would not dismiss the enhancements in any we remand the matter for the trial court to determine whether to strike the prior serious felony enhancements for the same reasons discussed above regarding the firearm enhancement. the law did not allow the court to strike the prior serious felony enhancements, the court did not indicate how it would exercise such discretion if available, and smith did not (and had no reason to) present argument urging the court to exercise a discretion it did not have. upon remand, if the trial court strikes an enhancement, it must resentence smith. disposition the convictions are affirmed. the matter is remanded to the trial court to determine whether to strike the enhancements under penal code sections 12022.5 and 667, and if an enhancement is stricken, to resentence smith. not to be published. chaney, j. we concur: rothschild, p. j. bendix, j.
