(people v. wende (1979) 25 cal.3d 436.) appellant filed a motion to augment the record on appeal with an order by judge henry j. hall, who treated the recall petition as a petition for writ of habeas corpus and denied it as untimely and lacking merit. the motion to augment was denied. in 1997, appellant was convicted by jury of sale of a controlled substance. (health & saf. code,  11352, subd. (a).) he admitted to having suffered three prior strike convictions and to having served prior prison terms. (pen. code,  667, subds. (b)-(i),  667.5, subd.

(people v. bradford (2014) 227 cal.app.4th 1322, 1336.) it does not authorize a collateral attack on a prior strike conviction. the validity of such a conviction may properly be challenged by way of a petition for writ of habeas corpus.

(people v. garrett (1998) 67 cal.app.4th 1419, 1423.) we have reviewed the record on appeal and find no appealable issues.
