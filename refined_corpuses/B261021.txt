(pen. code,  1170.126, subd. (b), 422, 667, subds. (a) & (d), 667.5, subd. (b).) we affirm the order denying appellants petition for a recall of sentence. factual and procedural background on november 6, 2002, a jury convicted appellant as previously indicated. on november 25, 2002, the trial court imposed the above sentence, which included a prison term of 25 years to life pursuant to the three strikes law for the present offense of criminal threats.1 on october 24, 2014, appellant filed a petition for a recall of sentence pursuant to proposition 36. (pen. code,  1170.126, subd.

(evid. code,  452, subd. (d)(1), 455, subd. (a), 459, subds. (a), (c).) if a party disputes said taking of judicial notice, said party may furnish this court with appropriate information in a petition for rehearing. this procedure is deemed sufficient compliance with the requirement of evidence code section 459, subdivision (c). (people v. hallman (1973) 35 cal.app.3d 638, 641, fn. 1.) 3 by notice filed february 24, 2015, the clerk of this court advised appellant to submit within 30 days any contentions, grounds of appeal, or arguments he wished this court to consider. on april 9, 2015, appellant belatedly filed with this court a supplemental letter. in it, appellant asserts, inter alia, his petition for a recall of sentence is meritorious and he is amenable to rehabilitation. he also asserts he was 44 years old when arrested, he is 57 years old, he has accumulated countless character accolades, he accepts personal responsibility for his actions, and he no longer poses an unreasonable risk to public safety. he essentially argues we should reverse the trial courts order denying his petition. however, [o]n november 6, 2012, the voters approved proposition 36, the three strikes reform act of 2012, which amended sections 667 and 1170.12 and added section 1170.126 (hereafter the act). . . . the act . . . created a postconviction release proceeding whereby a prisoner who is serving an indeterminate life sentence imposed pursuant to the three strikes law for a crime that is not a serious . . . felony . . . may have his or her sentence recalled and be sentenced as a second strike offender . . . . (people v. yearwood (2013) 213 cal.app.4th 161, 167-168, italics added.) the act became effective november 7, 2012. (id. at p. 169.) penal code section 1170.126, subdivision (e)(1), states, in relevant part, an inmate is eligible for resentencing if [t]he inmate is serving an indeterminate term of life imprisonment . . . for a conviction of a felony or felonies that are not defined as serious . . . felonies by . . . [penal code section 1192.7, subdivision (c)]. (italics added.) in 2002, when appellant committed the present offense, on november 7, 2012, the effective date of the act, and in 2014, when appellant filed his petition, the crime of criminal threats was a  serious felony  within the meaning of penal code section 1192.7, subdivision (c)(38). it follows appellant was, by statute and as a matter of law, ineligible for resentencing under proposition 36. (pen. code,  1170.126, subds. (b), (e)(1) & (f).) the trial court properly denied appellants petition for a recall of sentence. 4 review on appeal we have examined the entire record and are satisfied counsel has complied fully with counsels responsibilities.
