(pen code,  1170.18, subd. (a).)1 we affirm. background according to the probation report, when hernandez was arrested on suspicion of burglary, he had in his possession a plastic baggie that contained methamphetamine, a play station joy box, an electronic gram scale, a cell phone charger, a gun holster, icenses and social security cards, and a ruger semi-automatic .22-caliber handgun. the victim told a probation officer that some of his property had been recovered and he estimated the total loss to him and his family to be more than $5,000. on march 22, 2005, hernandez pled no contest to grand theft and possession of a controlled substance, and admitted prior serious felony conviction and prior prison term allegations. ( 487; health & saf. code,  11377.) he was sentenced to a prison term of eight years and four months. following the enactment of proposition 47, hernandez petitioned on december 11, 2014, to have his convictions redesignated as misdemeanors. on january 6, 2015, n (count 3), but denied it as to the grand theft conviction (count 1). the trial court then -month prison term on count 3, redesignated that count as a misdemeanor conviction, and sentenced hernandez to one year in county jail, to be served consecutive to the seven-year prison term on count reconsideration of this ruling was denied by the trial court on february 27, 2015 because, 1 all further references are to the penal code unless otherwise specified. 3 contention hernandez contends the trial court erred by refusing to redesignate the count 1 grand theft conviction as a misdemeanor. discussion e conclude he was not eligible for relief under proposition 47 as to his count 1 conviction for grand theft because he failed to make any showing that the value of the stolen property did not exceed $950. proposition 47, enacted by voters on november 4, 2014 and effective the following day, reduces certain drug and theft offenses to misdemeanors unless committed by ineligible defendants.

(see people v. rivas-colon (2015) 241 cal.app.4th 444, 449; people v. sherow (2015) 239 cal.app.4th 875, 879-880.) 4 under well-e stole did not exceed $950.

(people v. rivas-colon, at pp. 449-450.) at the hearing on the petition, hernandez offered no evidenceand no argumentdemonstrating he was eligible for resentencing. the court therefore properly denied value of the property he stole did not exceed $950. determine whether the petitioner satisfies the criteria in subdivision (a 1170.18, the existence or nonexistence of which is essential to the claim for relief . . . that he is t the probation report, police report, and inadmissible hearsay are not part of the record of conviction; and that hernandez received ineffective assistance of counsel because his counsel failed to raise these issues. 5 disposition post-judgment ruling is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports edmon, p. j. we concur: aldrich, j. lavin, j.
