filed 5/14/19 p. v. magana ca2/7 not to be published in the official reports california rules of court, rule 8.1115(a), prohibits courts and parties from citing or relying on opinions not certified for publication or ordered published, except as specified by rule 8.1115(b). this opinion has not been certified for publication or ordered published for purposes of rule 8.1115. in the court of appeal of the state of california second appellate district division seven the people, plaintiff and respondent, v. wuendy m. magana et al., defendants and appellants. b280357 (los angeles county super. ct. no. pa083962) appeals from judgments of the superior court of los angeles county, daniel b. feldstern, judge. affirmed. karyn h. bucur, under appointment by the court of appeal, for defendant and appellant, wuendy m. magana. william l. heyman, under appointment by the court of appeal, for defendant and appellant, maria clemencia estrada. xavier becerra, attorney general, gerald a. engler, chief assistant attorney general, lance e. winters, senior assistant attorney general, zee rodriguez, acting supervising deputy 2 attorney general, and steven e. mercer, deputy attorney general, for plaintiff and respondent. _________________ wuendy m. magana and maria clemencia estrada each pleaded no contest to one count of transporting more than four kilograms of a controlled substance in violation of health and safety code sections 11352, subdivision (a), and 11370.4, subdivision (a)(2), and were sentenced to a split term of three years in county jail and five years of mandatory supervision. on appeal magana and estrada contend the condition of mandatory supervision authorizing unlimited searches of their electronic devices, including smart phones, is unconstitutionally overbroad. we affirm. factual and procedural background conducted a traffic stop of an suv in the area of interstate 5 north of castaic on the afternoon of july 22, 2015. magana was after receiving permission to search the vehicle, leitelt opened a black suitcase in the rear storage area of the suv and found five wrapped packages that contained a total of 4.992 kilograms of cocaine. leitelt also found four cell phones in the suv. magana and estrada were charged with the sale or transport of a controlled substance (health & saf. code,  11352, subd. (a)), with a special allegation that the weight of the controlled substance exceeded four kilograms (health & saf. code,  11370.4, subd. (a)(2)). after initially pleading not guilty and prior to a hearing on a motion to suppress evidence (pen. code,  1538.5), magana and estrada each pleaded no contest to 3 the charge of transporting a controlled substance and admitted the special allegation that the controlled substance exceeded four kilograms by weight. at the sentencing hearing on october 4, 2016 the court denied probation and sentenced both magana and estrada to eight-year terms in county jail (the lower term of three years for the substantive offense plus five years for the weight enhancement), but suspended execution of five years on each sentence, placing them instead on mandatory supervision for five years pursuant to penal code section 1170, subdivision (h)(5).1 one of the conditions of mandatory supervision imposed by the court is that magana and estrada time of the day or night by any probation officer or other peace officer, with or without a warrant, probable cause, or reasonable suspicion. and this search and seizure condition involves their person, residence, vehicles, electronic information, and personal belongings. and [as to the] property subject to search and seizure, which includes any electronic devices owned or possessed by the defendants, they are consenting to provide passwords and any access to those phones or other electronic devices as a condition of this search and rsuant to 2 1 magana and estrada were each awarded eight days of presentence custody credit. 2 orders is slightly different: search and seizure at any time of the day or night, by any probation officer or other peace officer, with or without a warrant, probable cause or reasonable suspicion. [] as part of your 4 neither magana nor estrada objected to any of the conditions imposed by the court for the five-year period of mandatory supervision. discussion 1. magana and estrada have not forfeited their facial overbreadth challenge to the electronics search condition in most cases the failure to object to a condition of probation or mandatory supervision forfeits the issue for appellate review. (see people v. welch (1993) 5 cal.4th 228, 234-235 [failure to object to the reasonableness of a probation condition precludes the defendant from raising the challenge on appeal]; accord, people v. moran (2016) 1 cal.5th 398, 404, fn. 7.)3 supervision, whether probation, mandatory supervision, community supervision or parole, you will be required to submit your person, residence, vehicle, electronic information, and personal belongings to search or seizure, at any time of the day or night, with or without probable cause by any law enforcement officer. you will also be waiving all rights under the electronic communications privacy act specified in penal code section 1546 the of the condition, which included the requirement that magana and estrada provide passwords for their electronic devices, controls ove(see people v. farell (2002) 28 cal.4th 381, 384, fn. 2; people v. mullins (2018) 19 cal.app.5th 594, 612.) 3 mandatory supervision following a county jail commitment, imposed under penal code section 1170, subdivision (h), s akin to a state prison commitment; it is not a grant of probation or a people v. fandinola (2013) 221 cal.app.4th 1415, 1422; see id. ; see also 5 this forfeiture rule applies to constitutional challenges to probation conditions if the constitutional question cannot be resolved without reference to the sentencing record developed by the trial court. (in re sheena k. (2007) 40 cal.4th 875, 889 (sheena k.).) however, in sheena k. the supreme court held a constitutional challenge to a probation condition based on vagueness or overbreadth may be reviewed on appeal if it id. at pp. 888-889.) as discussed, magana and estrada did not object to the electronics search condition in the trial court. to the extent they raise a facial challenge to the constitutional validity of that condition, their claim has not been forfeited. (sheena k., supra, 40 cal.4th at pp. 888-889.) however, we address only the constitutionality of the challenged condition, not whether it is reasonable as applied to magana or estrada. (see generally people v. olguin (2008) 45 cal.4th 375, 380 even if a condition of probation has no relationship to the crime of which a defendant was convicted and involves conduct that is not itself criminal, the condition is valid as long as the condition is reasonably related to people v. lent (1975) 15 cal.3d ondition of probation will not be held invalid people v. martinez (2014) 226 cal.app.4th 759, 763.) nonetheless, it is similar to probation in the sense that the terms and conditions of the defendants release are ordered by the court at the sentencing hearing. thus, the rationale for the rule of forfeiture imposing conditions for mandatory supervision. 6 offender was convicted, (2) relates to conduct which is not in itself criminal, and (3) requires or forbids conduct which is not reasonably related people v. moran, supra, 1 cal.5th at p. 403.) 2. the electronics search condition is not unconstitutionally overbroad or those limitations to the purpose of the condition to avoid being invalidated as sheena k., supra, 40 cal.4th at p. 890.) magana and estrada acknowledge that cell phones are frequently used in connection with the transportation and sale of cocaine4 and concede that requiring a defendant convicted of violating health and safety code section 11352, subdivision (a), to permit law enforcement officers to search his or her cell phone as a condition of mandatory supervision serves a legitimate state interest. however, smartphone as a powerful computer privacies of life, as recognized by the united states supreme court in riley v. california (2014) 573 u.s. 373, 393, 403 [134 s.ct. 2473, 189 l.ed.2d 430] (riley),5 magana and estrada 4 as discussed, in addition to nearly five kilograms of cocaine, deputy leitelt recovered four cell phones from the suv being driven by magana. 5 explaining triley, supra, 573 u.s. at p. 393), the united states supreme court in riley held the search-incident-to-arrest exception to the general 7 contend by authorizing unlimited searches of their smartphones and other personal electronic devices, rather than restricting permissible searches to data that may be reasonably likely to contain indicia of illegal conduct, the condition imposed by the trial court is unconstitutionally overbroad, violating their fourth amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures and their right to privacy.6 an identical constitutional challenge to a similar electronics search condition imposed as a condition of probation methamphetamine for sale was upheld in people v. maldonado (2018) 22 cal.app.5th 138, review granted june 20, 2018, s248800 (maldonado). the court explained its holdingconditions serve to promote rehabilitation and reduce recidivism while helping to protect the community from potential harm by probatbroader privacy guaranteed under the fourth amendment to individuals who are not serving sentences or on grants of onviction expectation of privacy that was at issue in riley [] the purpose of the challenged conditions is to prevent defendant from using prohibition of warrantless searches does not apply to cell phones. (id. at pp. 401-402.) 6 we review de novo a constitutional challenge to a condition of mandatory supervision. (see people v. appleton (2016) 245 cal.app.4th 717, 723; in re malik j.

(see schmitz, at p. pursuant to california rules of court, rule 8.512(d)(2), the supreme court has granted a petition for review and deferred pending consideration and disposition of a related issue in in re ricardo p., s230923 . . . or pending further order of in more than 70 cases involving the validity of electronics search conditions similar to the condition imposed in this case. the courts of appeal have been divided in ruling whether those search condition are constitutional. (compare, e.g., people v. trujillo (2017) 15 cal.app.5th 574, review granted nov. 29, 2017, s244650 [electronics search condition not unconstitutionally overbroad] with, e.g., people v. valdiva (2017) 16 cal.app.5th 1130, review granted feb. 14, 2018, s245893 [electronics search condition is unconstitutionally overbroad].) briefing in in re ricardo p. was completed by the parties on september 28, 2016. oral argument has now been scheduled for may 30, 2019. 10 interest in supervising parolees is substantial.
