(a)(1)), and the jury found true allegations that he had four , including two convictions for robbery, a conviction for possession of a firearm by a felon, and a conviction for possession of cocaine for salelaw to 25 years to life in prison and imposed a sentence enhancement of 3 years for prior prison terms pursuant to section 667.5, subdivision (b). in january 2013, morrison filed a petition to recall his sentence under the three strikes reform act of 2012, added by proposition 36 and approved by the voters on november 6, 2012, 1 all further statutory references will be to the penal code. 3 which permits an inmate serving an indeterminate life sentence under the three strikes law for a nonviolent, nonserious felony to seek a new, lesser sentence, unless resentencing would pose an unreasonable risk to public safety. ( 1170.126, subds. (b), (e), (f).) after reviewing the record of conviction, including the trial conviction (people v. morrison (aug. 20, 1997, b102553 [nonpub. opn.]), the trial court found morrison was ineligible for resentencing because he had been armed with a firearm during the commission of his offense. morrison timely appealed. discussion morrison contends he is eligible for resentencing. we disagree. section 1170.126 was added as part of the three strikes reform act. (voter information guide, text of prop. 36,  6, pp. 109-110.) among its stated purposes, as explained to voters, was repeat offenders convicted of non-violent, non-serious crimes like shoplifting and simple drug possession will receive twice the id.,  1, p. 105.) in accordance with these goals, section 1170.126 permits an inmate serving an indeterminate life sentence under the previous version of the three strikes law to petition for recall of the sentence and resentencing to a term that would have been imposed under the revised law. but subdivision (e)(2) of section 1170.126 provides that an inmate is ineligible for resentencing if the current sentence was imposed for an offense described in subdivision (e)(2)(c) of section 4 667. ( 1170.126, subd. (e)(2); people v. hicks (2014) 231 cal.app.4th 275, 282.)2 among the offenses described in subdivision (e)(2)(c) of section 667 is any offense during the com . . . was armed with a firearm or deadly weapon . . . .3 possession of a firearm was armed with the firearm during the commission of that offense, the armed with a firearm exclusion proposition 36. (people v. brimmer (2014) 230 cal.app.4th 782, 797; accord people v. white (2016) 243 cal.app.4th 1354, 1363-1365; people v. hicks, supra, 231 cal.app.4th at pp. 283-284; people v. elder (2014) 227 cal.app.4th 1308, 1312-1314, 1317; people v. osuna (2014) 225 cal.app.4th 1020, 1030-1032; people v. white (2014) 223 cal.app.4th 512, 525.) here, morrison was armed with a gun during the commission of his possession offense, which sufficed for the firearm exclusion to apply. morrison argues that having been armed during the commission of his offense (possession of a firearm by a felon) does 2 subdivision (e)(2) of section 1170.126 provides in pertinent part that an inmate is eligible for resentencing if the inmates current sentence was not imposed for any of the offenses appearing in clauses (i) to (iii), inclusive, of subparagraph (c) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (e) of section 667 3 subdivision (e)(2)(c)(iii) of section 667 disqualifies a uring the commission of the current offense, the defendant used a firearm, was armed with a firearm or deadly weapon, or intended to cause great bodily injury to another person. 5 not disqualify him from resentencing under proposition 36 because being armed is an element of the offense. he argues the armed with a firearm exclusion applies only when being armed is other offense. the argument is without merit. eing armed with a firearm is not an element of possession of a firearm by a felon. (see people v. brimmer, supra, 230 cal.app.4th at pp. 795, 799.) people v. pea (1999) 74 cal.app.4th 1078, 1083.) armed if the defendant has the specified weapon people v. bland ing available for use. lives) is searched and a firearm is found next to his bed. the parolee is in possession of the firearm, because it is under his dominion and control. if he is not home at the time, however, he is not armed with the firearm, because it is not readily available to him for offensive or defensive use. accordingly, possessing a firearm does not necessarily constitute being armed with a people v. osuna, supra, 225 cal.app.4th at p. 1030.) that is, whether a felon in possession of a firearm was armed with the firearm at the time of the offense depends on the specific circumstances. (see ibid.) here, morrison had a loaded .357 magnum on his person as he was chased by deputies. thus, at the time that he possessed the firearm, morrison also had it readily available for use. he was therefore meaning of proposition 36, which renders him ineligible for resentencing. the trial court correctly denied his recall petition. 6 disposition the order dismissing petition is affirmed. not to be published. chaney, j. we concur: rothschild, p. j. johnson, j.
