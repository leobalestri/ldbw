(people v. tenner (1993) 6 cal.4th 559, 563; in re jones (1994) 27 cal.app.4th 1032, 1041; people v. elmore (1990) 225 cal.app.3d 953, 956-957.) under s were sufficient. (people v. mosby (2004) 33 cal.4th 353, 356; people v. carrasco (2012) 209 cal.app.4th 715, 724-725.) the totality of the circumstances in this case include: the inallegations; ; 1 further statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise noted. 3 representation by counsel at the court trial on the alleged prior convictions; -year enhancements. the information alleges defendant had suffered three prior convictions within the meaning of section said offense(s). did not remain free of prison custody for, and did commit an offense resulting in a felony conviction during, a terms were alleged to have been served in case nos. ba224181 (2002), ba315050 (2007), and ba384290 (2012). defendant was representing himself when he first appeared for trial. the trial court discussed with him his potential sentence. the trial -ion of his potential sentence. defendant advised the trial court: consistent with his representations in the trial court, defendant had a long history of prior convictions including: unauthorized use of a vehicle in 1977; burglary in 1980; two theft convictions in 1983; petty theft in 1984; petty theft again in 1986; robbery in 1985; failure to appear in 1987; controlled substance transportation or sale in 1987; controlled substance possession in 1990; controlled substance transportation or sale in 1991; two separate convictions of narcotic, drug or alcohol possession in 1996; driving on private property without consent in 1997; controlled substance use in 1997; narcotic, drug or alcohol possession in 1998; public intoxication in 2000; controlled substance possession in 2000; controlled substance transportation or sale in 2002; controlled substance transportation or sale in 2007; controlled substance possession in 2012; controlled substance paraphernalia possession in 2013; and controlled substance possession in 2013. defendant waived his jury trial right and a court trial was held on the prior conviction allegations, including the prior prison terms. by this time, defendant was 4 represented by appointed counsel. at the outset of the proceeding, the trial court hink there is a strike prior and some one-allegation, including the prior prison term enhancements. mr. wilson discussed the case numbers, the crimes committed and the conviction dates. defendant then admitted that the nine prior conviction allegations were true. defendant expressly admitted that one of those convictions was for a serious or violent felony within the meaning of sections 667, admission of the prior conviction, the strike in case a765289, and i accept the three one-year priors pursuant to 667.5(b), anlight of all the foregoing circumstances, we conclude defendant voluntarily and intelligently admitted the section 667.5, subdivision (b) prior separate prison term allegations. the trial court did not err by imposing three one-year enhancements for the prior prison terms. (people v. mosby, supra, 33 cal.4th at p. 365; people v. carrasco, supra, 209 cal.app.4th at pp. 724-725.) the information alleged defendant had been convicted of a serious felony, robbery, in case no. a765289 and was thus subject to sentencing under sections 667, section 1385, subdivision (a) (section 1385) motion to strike that prior serious felony conviction allegation. defendant contends the trial court abused its discretion in so doing. we find no abuse of discretion. when exercising its section 1385 authority with respect to a prior conviction allegation under sections 667, subdivisions (b) through (i), and 1170.12, a trial court may consider: serious or violent felonies; his or her background, character, and prospects; whether the 5 defendant may be deemed outside the spirit of the sentencing scheme, in whole or in part; and therefore whether the accused should be treated as though he or she had not previously been convicted of one or more serious or violent felonies. (people v. wallace (2004) 33 cal.4th 738, 747-748; people v. williams (1998) 17 cal.4th 148, 160-161.) on review, we consider those same factors. (in re large (2007) 41 cal.4th 538, 552; people v. williams, supra, 17 cal.4th at p. the prior conviction allegation for an abuse of discretion. (people v. carmony (2004) 33 cal.4th 367, 374-376; people v. philpot (2004) 122 cal.app.4th 893, 904; see in re coley (2012) 55 cal.4th 524, 545.) there was no abuse of discretion. as noted briefly above, defendant had a long history of felony convictions as well as several misdemeanors. on november 12, 1977, defendant was charged in texas with unauthorized use of a vehicle. he was sentenced to efendant committed a burglary, also in confinement. and on february 18, 1983, defendant committed another theft in texas. defendant then moved from texas to california. defendant committed his first california crime on november 13, 1984. compton police officers arrested defendant for petty theft ( 484, subd.

(case no. ba408028.) we have no record of the disposition in that matter. on april 4, 2013, defendant committed the present offense. officer jose diaz testified he was conducting surveillance in an area known for drug trafficking. officer diaz saw defendant sell heroin to another person for cash. defendant testified he was a 8 vietnam veteran who had been living in the skid row area of downtown los angeles for at least 15 years. date is december 25, 1965, which belies his claim he was a vietnam veteran, at least during a period of armed conflict. defendant was trying to help a young man obtain heroin from a drug dealer. defendant identified the young man only as mr. gleason. defendant denied he had sold any heroin. defendant testified, d asked if i could take some time to decided to help them because they were white. mr. gleason and his girlfriend looked out of place in skid row because of their race. defendant received a $20 bag of methamphetamine from mr. gleason. mr. gleason handed defendant $18 in cash when they were about a half a block from the location of the heroin connection. defendant said he never had any heroin in his possession. defendant denied giving any heroin to mr. gleason. with for 35 years. just the last two years i replaced it with methamphetamine because it lasts -release community supervision when he committed the present offense. but defendant had never reported to the probation department. as a result, an arrest warrant had been issued for his apprehension. his post-release community supervision had been due to expire on july 31, 2015. defendant also had an outstanding traffic warrant. and he had a record of four out-of-state arrests with no disposition indicated. the probation officer of criminal activity. . . . apparently, he continues to commit criminal conduct. evidently, defendant . . . chose to participate in a scheme to sell a controlled substance. his unlawful and anti-social conduct contribute[s] to the deterioration of the community, and has no social redeeming value. there is no compelling reason to believe he will comply under supervision even if probation is granted. moreover, the defendant is deemed unsuitable and ineligible for a 9 grant of probation at this point. [] if convicted of the present offense, a state prison and safety of the community at risk. therefore, a period of incarceration would serve both to protect the community from further criminal acts by defendant . . . , and as a ion allegation under sections 667, subdivisions (b) through (i), and 1170.12, was well within the bounds of reason. defendant made no case that his character, background or prospects set him outside the spirit of the sentencing scheme. as the trial court reasonably concluded, the defendant from continuing to use illegal drugs and commit crimes. no abuse of discretion occurred. c. fines and fees the trial court orally imposed a $50 criminal laboratory analysis fee (health & saf. code we assume the trial -only deoxyribonucleic acid penalty (gov. code,  76104.7, subd.

(b)) and a $2,520 parole revocation restitution fine ( 1202.45). those fines are erroneously recorded in the abstract of judgment in the amount of $2,500 each. the oral pronouncement of judgment controls. (people v. farell (2002) 28 cal.4th 381, 384, fn. 2; people v. mesa (1975) 14 cal.3d 466, 471.) the parties agree that the abstract of judgment must be amend iii. disposition the judgment is modified to include, in connection with the $50 criminal laboratory analysis fee (health & saf. code,  11372.5, subd.
