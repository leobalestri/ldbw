(a)) and illegally cultivating marijuana2 (health and saf. code,  11358). as to the attempted murder charge, the people alleged salido personally and intentionally discharged a firearm causing great bodily injury under section 12022.53, subdivision (d), and that he personally inflicted great bodily injury under section 12022.7, subdivision (a). the people also alleged two firearm enhancements under section 12022.53, subdivisions (b) and (c). finally, the people alleged salido suffered four prior convictions for robbery ( 211), one of which occurred in 2002 while salido was a juvenile and three of which occurred in 2005, and all of which qualified as serious or violent felonies under the three-strikes law ( 667, subds. (b)-(i) & 1170.12, subds. (a)-(d)). in september 2015, a jury convicted salido of attempted murder and illegally cultivating marijuana. the jury also found true all of the firearm and great bodily injury allegations.3 in a bifurcated bench trial, salido admitted his four prior robbery convictions. after admitting his prior convictions, salido made an oral motion to strike those convictions under romero. following: romero, submit.the people opposed the motion, arguing salido did not fall outside the spirit of the three-strikes law because his prior convictions were not remote in time. the people explained he had received a seven-year prison sentence for those convictions, and had therefore failed to remain crime-free while out of custody for a significant period of time before 2 while investigating the shooting, police found numerous marijuana plants and 3 in addition, the jury found that the attempted murder was committed willfully, deliberately, and with premeditation. 4 committing the attempted murder in this case. tfound his prior convictions were similar in nature to his current attempted murder conviction because they were all violent crimesconvictions were not remote in time because salido had remained crime-free for only a . the court sentenced salido to an aggregate term of 53 years to life in prison. as to murder conviction, the court imposed a term of 25 years to life pursuant to the three-strikes law ( 667, subds. (b)-(i) & 1170.12, subds. (a)-(d)), a consecutive term of 25 years to life under section 12022.53, subdivision (d), and a consecutive three-year term under section 12022.7, subdivision (a). the court also imposed, but stayed, 10- and 20-year enhancements under section 12022.53, subdivisions (b) and (c), respectively. as to illegally cultivating marijuana, the court imposed the mid-sentence for the attempted murder conviction. discussion 1. the court should have stayed execution of the great bodily injury enhancement imposed under section 12022.7, subdivision (a). salido contends, and the people concede, the court erred when it imposed and executed both great bodily injury enhancements under sections 12022.53, subdivision (d), and 12022.7, subdivision (a). we agree. the sentence enhancements imposed under sections 12022.53, subdivision (d), and 12022.7, subdivision (a), increase the punishment for a defendant who personally inflicts great bodily injury on someone other than his or her accomplice. under section 12022.53, subdivision (d), the court must impose an additional term of 25 years to life in prison if the jury finds the y and intentionally discharge[d] a firearm . . . [,] proximately caus[ing] great bodily injury . . . to any person other than an accomplice (a), the court must impose an additional three-sonally inflicts great bodily injury on any 5 however, in the event both sentence enhancements are proven true, the court can impose and execute only the section 12022.53, subdivision (d), enhancement; the court should impose but stay execution of the section 12022.7, subdivision (a), enhancement. ( 12022.53, subd. (f) n enhancement for great bodily injury as defined in section 12022.7 . . . shall not be imposed on a person in addition to an enhancement imposed pursuant to [section 12022.53,] subdivision (d)]; see also people v. gonzalez (2008) 43 cal.4th 1118, 1127-1130 (gonzalez) [if both enhancements are proven true, the court should impose but stay execution of the section 12022.7, subdivision (a), enhancement].) here, the court imposed both great bodily injury sentence enhancements, but it did not stay execution of the three-year enhancement imposed under section 12022.7, subdivision (a). the judgment should be modified to reflect a stay of execution of that enhancement. ( 12022.53, subd. (f); see also gonzalez, supra, 43 cal.4th at pp. 1127-1130.) 2. the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to strike onvictions. salido next contends the court abused its discretion when it denied his romero motion and refused to strike his prior convictions. specifically, he contends he falls outside the spirit of the three-strikes law because he remained crime-free for nearly ten years before he committed the attempted murder in this case. we disagree. in romero, the california supreme court held that, under the three-strikes law, a sentencing court retains discretion to strike the furtherance of justice. (romero, supra, 13 cal.4th at p. 504.) when ruling on a motion to strike a prior strike conviction, the court in question must consider whether, in light of the nature and circumstances of his present felonies and prior serious and/or violent felony convictions, and the particulars of his background, character, and prospects, the defendant may be deemed outside the schemes spirit, in whole or in part, and hence should be treated as though he had not previously been 6 convicted of one or more speople v. williams (1998) 17 cal.4th 148, 161.) abuse of discretion. (people v. carmony (2004) 33 cal.4th 367, 376.) when the factors manifestly support the striking of a prior conviction and no reasonable minds could differthe failure to strike would constitute an abuse of discretion.(id. at p. 378.) in this case, the court reasonably found salido did not fall outside the spirit of the three-argument on appeal, his prior robbery convictions are not remote in time and nothing in the record supports finding that the three robbery convictions in 2005 arose from the same act. in fact, salido concedes salido was convicted of his first robbery in 2002, he committed three additional robberies in 2005, or just three years later. as a consequence of his 2005 convictions, salido received a seven-year prison sentence. within only a few years of being released from custody for the 2005 crimes, salido committed the 2014 attempted murder offense. put another way, the fact salido waited until 2014 to commit the attempted murder offense was not because he was rehabilitated after 2005he was in state custody for most of that time period. moreover, as the court observed, were similar in nature to his instant attempted murder conviction in that they were all violent felonies. on this record, we cannot say the court abused its discretion in denying romero motion. 7 disposition the judgment is modified to reflect a stay of execution of the three-year sentence enhancement imposed under section 12022.7, subdivision (a). as modified, the judgment is affirmed. the trial court is directed to prepare a corrected abstract of judgment and to forward it to the department of corrections and rehabilitation. not to be published in the official reports lavin, j. we concur: edmon, p. j. stratton, j.* * judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
