the evidence indicated that appellant lived in the residence; and appellant was the one who suggested a possession charge. thus, there was no misunderstanding about what the nature of the charges were against him. offered appellant a reduced charge because there was insufficient evidence that the pleading to possession of cocaine. also, appellant had indicated that he understood the plea form thescobedo got what can only be called a good deal for you, and it appears from everything pleading to. there was no mention of b. applicable law in marsden, the california supreme court held that a defendant seeking substitution of counsel must be permitted by the trial court to specify the reasons for the request. (marsden, supra, 2 cal.3d at p. marsden are fully performed when it affords a defendant the opportunity to present the grounds for his motion. (people v. majors (1998) 18 cal.4th 385, 412413.) an indigent defendant does not have the right to the appointment of new counsel absent a clear and substantial showing of inadequate representation or that the defendant and counsel have become embroiled in such an irreconcilable conflict that ineffective representation is likely to result. (people v. myles (2012) 53 cal.4th 1181, 1207; people v. clark (2011) 52 cal.4th 856, 912.) but, tactical disagreements between a defendant and his appointed counscause for substitution of counsel. (people v. myles, supra, at p. 1207; people v. jackson 6 with his counsel in order to receive effective representation. (people v. clark (1992) 3 cal.4th 41, 100.) marsden motion will not be reversed absent an abuse of discretion. (people v. myles, supra, 53 cal.4th at p. 1207.) c. analysis here, the appellate record establishes that the trial court conducted a marsden hearing when appellant stated that he wanted to withdraw his guilty plea on the ground that his attorney provided ineffective assistance. according to appellant, mr. escobedo did not properly inform him regarding the charge to which he was pleading guilty. appellant thought that the charge was possession of marijuana. but, according to mr. na; the only issue discussed people v. myles, supra, 53 cal.4th at p. 1207.) after listening to trial court reasonably concluded that appellant had not shown a substantial impairment of his right to counsel. (people v. clark, supra, 52 cal.4th at p. 912.) the trial court did far more than rely solely on its courtroom observations. rather, the record shows that the trial court gave appellant the opportunity to relate specific acts of misconduct and areas of dissatisfaction. thus, he was not entitled to substitute counsel and the trial court did marsden motion. ii. the trial court did not abuse its discretion by finding no materials responsive to pursuant to pitchess v. superior court (1974) 11 cal.3d 531 (pitchess), appellant moved for discovery of personnel information relating to officer lozano regarding numerous types of misconduct. the trial court granted the motion. after examining the ials responsive to the 7 discovery request. on appeal, appellant asks us to independently review for error the sealed record of the in camera proceeding. the people do not object to this request. when requested by an appellant, an appellate court may independently review the pitchess hearing to determine whether the trial court disclosed all relevant complaints. (people v. mooc (2001) 26 cal.4th 1216, 12291232.) a trial court is vested with broad discretion in pitchess motion for abuse of that discretion. (people v. samayoa (1997) 15 cal.4th 795, 827.) we have reviewed the record of these proceedings, court properly evaluated the materials and its order concerning the disclosure of the pitchess materials was correct. disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. _____________________________, j. ashmann-gerst we concur: ______________________________, p. j. boren ______________________________, j. chavez
