(a)).2 1 unless otherwise specified, all further statutory references are to the penal code. 2 the charging information was unclear as to what ray allegedly had counterfeited and forged. count 1 alleges she . . . [by] unlawfully and with intent to defraud, forg[ing] and counterfeit[ing] a u.s. is unclear whether this referred to a u.s. treasury intent to pass and facilitate the passage and utterance of [a] resentencing hearing, her counsel stated that both sentences 3 ray entered a plea as to both charges and was sentenced to state prison. on february 3, 2015, ray filed a petition seeking to reduce her felony conviction3 to a misdemeanor under proposition 47. on the petition, she checked the box indicating she was eligible 470/473 the trial court denied the petition, finding statute is pretty specific as to what does and does not come under ray filed a timely appeal. discussion a. proposition 47 and the applicable code sections 47 makes certain drug- and theft-related offenses misdemeanors, unless the offenses were committed by certain ineligible defendants. these offenses had previously been purposes of our analysis, we will assume that ray had in her possession $400 worth of counterfeit u.s. currency bearing the seal of the u.s. treasury. it is irrelevant to our ultimate holding whether she in fact was convicted of possession of forged treasury bills, treasury notes or currency, provided the total value was $950 or less, as bills, notes and currency are all covered under section 473, subdivision (b). 3 it is unclear whether ray sought to reduce one or both of the convictions. in the trial court and on appeal, she focuses solely on her conviction of forgery or counterfeiting of a seal in violation of section 472. 4 designated as either felonies or wobblers (crimes that can be (people v. rivera (2015) 233 cal.app.4th 1085, 1091.) 47 (1) added chapter 33 to the government code ( 7599 et seq.), (2) added sections 459.5, 490.2, and 1170.18 to the penal code, and (3) amended penal code sections 473, 476a, 496, and 666 and health and safety code . . . . (voter information guide, gen. elec. (nov. 4, 2014) text of prop. 47,  4-14, pp. 70-ibid.) section 1170.18, subdivision (a), now provides: a person currently serving a sentence for a conviction, whether by trial or plea, of a felony or felonies who would have been guilty of a this act been in effect at the time of the offense may petition for a recall of sentence before the trial court that entered the judgment of conviction in his or her case to request resentencing in accordance with sections 11350, 11357, or 11377 of the health and safety code, or section 459.5, 473, 476a, 490.2, 496, or 666 of the penal code, as those sections have been amended or added by 4 forgery is punishable by imprisonment in a county jail for not more than one year, or by imprisonment pursuant to subdiviamended by proposition 47, the former provisions became subdivision (a). proposition 47 added subdivision (b) 4 subdivision (b) of section 1170.18 provides additional criteria for determining whether a defendant qualifies for resentencing, behavior while incarcerated, and whether the defendant poses an unreasonable risk to public safety. 5 (section 473(b)), which provides in relevant part: of order does not exceed nine hundred fifty dollars ($950), shall be punishable by imprisonment in a county jail for not more than one year . . . . this subdivision shall not be applicable to any person who is convicted both of forgery and of identity theft, as (see generally people v. salmorin (2016) 1 cal.app.5th 738, 743.) section 473 does not define the substantive offense of rather, it sets the sentence for substantive forgery offenses defined elsewhere in the penal code. section 470, the general forgery statute, defiofof documents, which includes the items listed in section 473(b), plus others, such as warrants, promissory notes, contracts, lottery tickets, powers of attorney, and stock certificates. sections 470a and 470b refer to forgery of licenses and identification cards; sections 471 and 471.5 refer to forgery of records. section 472 refers to forgery or counterfeiting of the seal of this state, the seal of any public officer authorized by law, the seal of any court of record, or the seal of any corporation, or any other public seal authorized or recognized by the laws of this state, or of any other state, government, or country5 5 every person who, with intent to defraud another, forges, or counterfeits the seal of this state, the seal of any public officer authorized by law, the seal of any court of record, or the seal of any corporation, or any other public seal 6 b. analysis ray claims that her conviction involved the possession of $400 worth of counterfeit u.s. currency, on which an official seal appeared. she contends that therefore she was convicted of bank bill [or] notewithin the types of forgeries that the voters intended to make eligible for resentencing. the courts of appeal have previously within the meaning of section 473.

[citation.] provision employed in a statute is intended to have meaning and to perform a useful function . . . [citations. (white v. county of sacramento (1982) 31 cal.3d 676, 681.) we should strive to give effect and significance to every word and phrase of a statute . . . . (save our heritage organisation v. city of san diego (2015) 237 cal.app.4th 163. 174.) with this expansive reading of the find proposition 47 intended to treat as misdemeanors any type of forgery or counterfeiting activity connected to the specific instruments enumerated in section 473(b): a check, bond, bank bill, note, cashforgery of a false u.s. treasury seal that appears on a bill, note 9 forgery of the seal is an integral aspect of forging a counterfeit bill, at least one with any possibility of passing as real. under underlying financial instrument. this interpretation of section 473(b) is also consistent with intent in enacting proposition 47, which ensure that prison spending is focused on violent and serious offenses, to maximize alternatives for nonserious, nonviolent crime, and to invest the savings generated from this act into prevention and support programs in k-12 schools, victim services, and mental health and drug treatment. this act ensures that sentences for people convicted of dangerous crimes (voter information guide, gen. elec. (nov. 4, 2014) text of prop. 47,  2, p. 70.) as applicable here, the stated intent of proposition 47 was (1) ensure that people convicted of murder, rape, and child molestation will not benefit from this act. [] . . . [] (3) require misdemeanors instead of felonies for nonserious, nonviolent crimes like petty theft and drug possession, unless the defendant has prior convictions for specified violent or serious crimes. [] (4) authorize consideration of resentencing for anyone who is currently serving a sentence for any of the offenses listed herein that are now misdemeanors. (ibid.) there is no reasonable basis for concluding the voters intended to treat the forgery of a seal on a bank bill or note as more serious and deserving of greater punishment than the forgery of the bank bill or note itself. rather, the language of section 473(b) suggests that as long as the forgery was connected to or associated with any of the listed monetary instruments 10 checkschecks, or money ordersand the value of the instrument did not exceed $950, it would be considered a misdemeanor for purposes of sentencing. moreover, to the extent there is ambiguity in the phrase [w]hen language which is reasonably susceptible of two constructions is used in a penal law ordinarily that construction which is more favorable to the offender will be adopted. [] the defendant is entitled to the benefit of every reasonable doubt, whether it arise[s] out of a question of fact, or as to the true interpretation of words or the construction of language used in a statutein re rosalio s. (1995) 35 cal.app.4th 775, 781, quoting people v. davis (1981) 29 cal.3d 814, 828.) this principle supports an interpretation of section 473(b) to include a conviction of forgery or counterfeiting of a seal under section 472 to the extent the forgery or counterfeiting is related to any of the listed items having a value not exceeding $950. under this interpretation, a conviction of counterfeiting a seal unconnected to any of these instruments still would remain a crime ineligible for resentencing. however, section 473(b) must be interpreted more narrowly, applying only to offenses involving the forgery of the particular items listed. they rely on the maxim expressio unius est exclusio alteriusthe expression of some things in a statute necessarily means the exclusion of other things not expressedin re eric h. (1997) 54 cal.app.4th 955, 965) and the rule codified in code of civil procedure section 1858 statute. [citation.] (people v. guzman (2005) 35 cal.4th 577, 587). since section 473(b) does not specifically mention a seal, 11 the people claim forgery of a seal would not fall within that subdivision. (see people v. bush (2016) 245 cal.app.4th 992, 1001 [omission of  368 from  1170.18 means defendant convicted of that offense ineligible for resentencing under prop. 47]; cf. mountain lion foundation v. fish & game com. (1997) 16 cal.4th 105, 125; people v. williams (1963) 222 cal.app.2d 152, 155.) people v. gray (1979) 91 cal.app.3d 545, 551, on which the people rely, is distinguishable. gray considered the legislative enactment of former section 12022.7, which imposed an enhanced the intent to inflict such injury, personally inflicts great bodily injury on any person other than an accomplice in the commission or attempted commission of a felony . . . expressly excluded four offenses manslaughter, assault with a deadly weapon [and] (gray, supra, at p. 551, fn. 4; see also former  12022.7.) gray [t]he legislative inclusion of the four crimes as exceptions necessarily excludes any other exceptions [citation], a principle that the people argue applies to this case as well. (gray, supra, at p. 551.) the language of former section 12022.7, however, was unambiguous that the enactors intended only four enumerated crimes to be excluded from the three-year enhancement. the legislature did not use the broad and inclusive term . had the legislature included such language (for example, excluding from the three-year enhancement), the court in gray might well have found the attempted murder conviction at issue in that case to be excluded from the three-year enhancement. 12 our construction of the language in section 473(b) to include the related act of counterfeiting a seal on a bank note does not conflict with the court of appeal decisions finding the non-inclusion of certain penal code sections in section 1170.18 to preclude resentencing. for example, in people v. bush, supra, 245 cal.app.4th 992, the court held that a defendant convicted of elder abuse under section 3686 was not entitled to resentencing under proposition 47 because such conviction was not one of the specified offenses listed for eligibility under section 1170.18. it is true that section 472 also is not listed as one of the offenses explicitly designated for resentencing in section 1170.18. but proposition 47 expressly singled out section 368 convictions for exclusion from its resentencing goals. as the court pointed out in bush, proposition 47 rewrote section 666, adding language to subdivision (b) of section 366, excluding section 368 from the limited punishment under section 666 of one year in jail or 6 section 368, subdivision (b)(1), provides: any person who knows or reasonably should know that a person is an elder or dependent adult and who, under circumstances or conditions likely to produce great bodily harm or death, willfully causes or permits any elder or dependent adult to suffer, or inflicts thereon unjustifiable physical pain or mental suffering, or having the care or custody of any elder or dependent adult, willfully causes or permits the person or health of the elder or dependent adult to be injured, or willfully causes or permits the elder or dependent adult to be placed in a situation in which his or her person or health is endangered, is punishable by imprisonment in a county jail not exceeding one year, or by a fine not to exceed six thousand dollars ($6,000), or by both that fine and imprisonment, or by imprisonment in the state prison for two, three, or four 13 prison. this reflects proposition 47 was not intended to provide resentencing for a section 368 crime, because section 368 is considered a more serious offense than the listed theft crimes in section 1170.18. section 368 punishes offenders who prey on vulnerable elders and dependent adults . . . bush, supra, at pp. 1004-1005, fn. omitted.) proposition 47 did not rewrite any of the forgery statutes to exempt forgery involving a seal, nor is there anything in the penal code to indicate forgery of a seal is a more serious offense than forgery of a low denomination bank note bearing a seal. by contrast, section 368 contains prefatory language explaining precisely why the legislature considered crimes against the elderly or dependent adults to warrant special approbation. ( 368, subd. (a).) as we recently explained in people v. salmorin, supra, 1 proposition 47 also included a misdemeanors instead of felonies for nonserious, nonviolent crimes like petty theft and drug possession, unless the defendant interpretation of section 473, subdivision (b), is not a liberal construction of the statute and interpretation, fewer forgery offenses would qualify as because the trial court found a conviction under section 472 could not qualify for resentencing under proposition 47, as a matter of law, the trial court never considered whether conviction falls within the monetary cap imposed by 14 section 473(b), or whether she is entitled to resentencing given the other criteria set forth in section 1170.18. accordingly, the remanded for ray to have the opportunity to establish her eligibility for resentencing under proposition 47. (see people v. sherow (2015) 239 cal.app.4th 875, 880.) as we reverse, we need enial of due process argument. disposition the order is reversed, and the trial court is directed to this opinion. keeny, j.* we concur: perluss, p. j. zelon, j. * judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
