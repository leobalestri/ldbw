(b), counts 1, 2, and 6),2 two counts of sexual intercourse or sodomy with a child who is 10 years of age or younger ( 288.7, subd. (a), counts 4 and 5), and one count of using a minor as a model for sex acts ( 311.4, subd. (c), count 3). ortiz pleaded not guilty. trial was to the court. 2. the trial according to the evidence at trial ivy, then six years old, moved into an apartment in pomona with her great uncle, uncle and brother in december 2010. ortiz, a neighbor, lived downstairs in the same apartment building. once when they were alone, ortiz photographed ivy while she was naked. in response to a report of child sexual abuse in 2012, pomona police officer richard sprague was given a digital camera by ortigrandson, who also pointed out ortiz to sprague. the camera contained images of ortiz and ivy; ; ivy pulling up her skirt; and ivy with her pants lowered, exposing her genitals. the camera also contained a video recording depicting ortiz and 1 2 statutory references are to the penal code. 3 ivy engaged in sex acts. the photographs were introduced into evidence, and the video recording was played in court. nsel made a motion to dismiss ( 1118.1), which the trial court denied. ortiz neither testified nor introduced other evidence in his defense. argument. defense counsel did as well. the court found ortiz guilty of all charges. while discussing scheduling for the sentencing hearing, defense counsel asked the court to reconsider whether the people had proved the element of penetration beyond a reasonable doubt as to the three counts of violating section 288.7, subdivision (b). counsel argued ivy never testified there was penetration. although the video recording showed some sexual activity, counsel maintained it was questionable whether penetration had occurred. the court explained its findings based on its review of the video recording: t was clear to the court. the court could see penis, and his penis was in a position exposed and presented to her vaginal area where he had her legs up and he was leaning against her. at different times she indicated that it hurt and that he was engaging in thrusting motions while he had her in that position, and it was clear as he withdrew at different times, the court could still see his exposed penis, that he was stroking it at times after he withdrew and then engaged in the same conduct as he pushed up against her again. and she made comments about what he was doing, and it was clear based on his thrusting motions and the position he had her that it was clear that penetration was taking 3. the sentencing hearing at sentencing defense counsel urged the trial court to consider the interaction between ortiz and ivy of time, maybe about 15, 20 minutes . . . least five separate would start a different act, and that went on throughout the 20 minutes. there was time 4 for reflection between acts. for that reason, your honor, i believe it is clear that these [counts] should be sentenced separately. the trial court sentenced ortiz to an aggregate state prison term of 95 years to life, consisting of three consecutive terms of 15 years to life for oral copulation or sexual penetration of a child who is 10 years of age or younger (counts 1, 2 and 6) and two consecutive terms of 25 years to life for sexual intercourse or sodomy with a child who is 10 years of age or younger (counts 4 and 5); plus a consecutive term of eight months (one-third the middle term of two years) for using a minor as a model for sex acts (count 3).3 explaining its sentencing decision, the trial court stated, made its findings and found the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, the court also made characterizations from one count or crime to the other. in fact, as one of the sexual intercourse events were [sic] taking place between the defendant and the six-year-old, the six-year-old brought to his attention that she believed there was someone outside. he stopped. they both looked, and they closed the curtains. there was [sic] a lot of conversations between the minor and the defendant about different sex acts and the changing of positions. it was clear to this court that that i would characterize not a single occasion, but a single time frame in which multiple crimes were committed. the theory between the multiple crimes or multiple sex acts between one to the other is that the defendant had reasonable opportunity to reflect on his actions. nonetheless [he] resumed his sexual conduct with this six-year-old. the video is the best evidence for that acts from one act to the other, the circumstances from one act to the other, be it interruptions because of fear of detection or interruptions based upon a change of position or interruptions based upon going from one act to another act, after discussion or suggestions. this was one of the most egregious events that this court has 3 the abstract of judgment omits the consecutive sentence of 15 years to life the trial court orally pronounced on count 6. following resentencing on remand as directed in this opinion, this clerical error should be corrected in the new abstract of judgment. 5 i was presented with graphic videos that left nothing to the imagination or what was o discussion 1. ortiz has not demonstrated his counsel was ineffective a. governing law to establish ineffective assistance of counsel under either the federal or state constitutional guarantee, a defendant must show ths representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness under prevailing professional norms, and that counsels deficient performance was prejudicial, i.e., that a reasonable probability exists that, but for counsels failings, the result would have been more favorable to the defendant. (in re crew (2011) 52 cal.4th 126, 150; see strickland v. washington (1984) 466 u.s. 668, 694 [104 s.ct. 2052, 80 l.ed.2d 674]the burden of sustaining a charge of inadequate or ineffective representation is upon the defendant. the proof . . . must be a demonstrable reality and not a speculative matter.people v. karis (1988) 46 cal.3d 612, 656.) sound trial ststrickland v. washington, supra, 466 u.s. at pp. 689, 694; accord, people v. gamache (2010) 48 cal.4th 347, 391.) on a direct appeal a conviction will be reversed for ineffective assistance of counsel only when the challenged act or omission. (gamache, at p. 391; people v. anderson (2001) 25 cal.4th 543, 569.) in considering a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, it is not necessary to suffered by the defendant as a result of the alleged deficiencies. . . . if it is easier to dispose of an ineffectiveness claim on the ground of lack of sufficient prejudice, which in re champion (2014) 58 cal.4th 965, 1007, quoting strickland v. washington, supra, 466 u.s. at p. 697; in re alvernaz (1992) 2 cal.4th 924, 945; people v. mesa (2006) 144 cal.app.4th 1000, 1008.) 6 it is not sufficient to show the alleged errors may have had some conceivable effect on absent the errors the result would have been different. (champion, at p. 1007; mesa at p. 1008.) b. ortis waiver of closing argument although closing argument may serve an important function at trial, defense counsel may waive closing argument as a matter of tactics without that decision constituting ineffective assistance. (see bell v. cone (2002) 535 u.s. 685, 701-702 [122 s.ct. 1843, 152 l.ed.2d 914] [waiver of closing argument may be a reasonable tactical decision about which competent lawyers might disagree]; people v. diggs (1986) 177 cal.app.3d 958, 970 [waiver of closing argument in appropriate case is matter of sound trial strategy].)4 here, the record is silent on the reasons for decision to waive closing argument. nonetheless, it is highly plausible that defense counsel concluded ortiz would be better served if neither she nor the prosecutor made a closing argument and that, if she had proceeded to make an argument, the prosecutor would then have asserted the right to a final rebuttal. that would be a reasonable judgment call under the circumstances. in any event, ortiz has failed to demonstrate any likelihood, let alone a reasonable pro decision. this was a one-day court trial. the factual issues were simple. the evidence consisted of the brief testimony of four witnesses, several photographs and a 20-minute video recording. the testimony was straightforward and uncontroverted. there is simply no reason to believe closing moreover, counsel did ask the court to reconsider whether the video recording was sufficient 4 the mischaracterization of the issue by appellate counsel for ortiz as one simply a claim of ineffective assistance, is, at best, a gross distortion of the record. (see generally rules prof. conduct, rule 5-200(b) [in presenting a matter to a tribunal, a member of the state bar shall not seek to mislead the court by an artifice or false statement of fact or law].) 7 evidence of penetration. in response, the court explained what it saw and how that evidence proved penetration. thus, notwithstanding the initial waiver of closing factual issue with the court. 2. ortiz was properly sentenced to consecutive indeterminate terms section 288.7, subdivision (a), provides that any person 18 years or older who engages in sexual intercourse or sodomy with a child who is 10 years of age or younger is subject to a prison term of 25 years to life. section 288.7, subdivision (b), provides that any person who engages in oral copulation or sexual penetration with a child who is 10 years of age or younger is subject to a prison term of 15 years to life. the trial court has broad discretion in deciding whether to impose sentences for multiple convictions under section 288.7 concurrently or consecutively. (see  669; people v. monge (1997) 16 cal.4th 826, 850-851.) that discretion is guided by rule 4.424 of the california rules of court, which identifies specific criteria affecting the sentencing decision, including the presence of circumstances in aggravation or mitigation as identified in other provisions of the rules of court. one factor in aggravation may support a series of consecutive sentence. (see people v. scott (1994) 9 to impose both the upper term and a consecutive term. [citations.] however, one relevant and sustainable fact may explain a series of consecutivpeople v. osband (1996) 13 cal.4th 622, 728-729.) even though a defendant may have committed multiple violations of section 288.7, however, section 654 prohibits separate punishment for those offenses if they arose from a series of acts constituting an indivisible course of criminal conduct. (people v. rodriguez (2009) 47 cal.4th 501, 507; people v. latimer (1993) 5 cal.4th 1203, 1206.)5 a course of criminal conduct is divisible and therefore gives rise to 5 s punishable in different ways by different provisions of law shall be punished under the provision that provides for the longest potential term of imprisonment, but in no case shall the act or 8 more than one act within the meaning of section 654 depends on the intent and objective of the actor. if all the offenses were incident to one objective, the defendant may be rodriguez, at p. 507.) the supreme court in people v. perez (1979) 23 cal.3d 545 held a defendant could be separately punished for each sex crime committed in a single encounter even when closely connected in time. defendant should id. at p. 552), the c each sex offenseto is much too broad and amorphous to determine the applicability of section 654. . . . to accept such a broad, overriding intent and objective to preclude punishment for otherwise clearly separate ibid.) observing a defendant who attempts to achieve sexual gratification by committing a number of criminal acts is substantially more culpable than a defendant who commits only one such act, the court concluded: 654 beyond its purpose to preclude punishment for each such act.id. at p. 553; see people v. harrison (1989) 48 cal.3d 321, 336, 338 perez itself is the touchstone in determining ; a defendant should from the victim, he voluntarily resumed his s].) s multiple sexual convictions were not subject to section 654. as the trial court found, each offense was a distinct act, clearly separated by when ortiz ceased his sexual activity because he feared detection, changed positions with ivy or engaged in a discussion with her. omission be punished under more than one provision. an acquittal or conviction and 9 without questioning any of these fundamental sentencing principles or challenging their application to his case, ortiz argues the consecutive indeterminate life sentences imposed in this case were improper because violations of section 288.7, subdivisions (a) and (b), are not offenses listed in section 667.6, subdivision (e), and therefore are not subject to secticonsecutive offenses be imposed for certain specified sex crimes if they involve the same 667.6 is correct but wholly irrelevant. neither the prosecutor in her sentencing memorandum urging imposition of consecutive life terms for ortiz nor the trial court in explaining its sentencing decision referred in any way to section 667.6; and nothing in the record suggests the court misunderstood the nature of its obligation to sentence ortiz under sections 288.7 and 669, subdivision (a), which authorizes imposition of life occasions6 that is generally comparable to the test under people v. perez, supra, 23 cal.3d 545 and people v. harrison, supra, 48 cal.3d 321, to determine whether multiple punishment for multiple sex crimes is permissible under section 654. thus, in discussing its reasons for imposing consecutive sentences, the court referred to many of the same factors that would be germane to an analysis under that different sentencing scheme. that similarity standing alone, however, does not indicate the court relied upon 6 whether crimes against a single victim were committed on separate occasions under this subdivision, the court shall consider whether, between the commission of one sex crime and another, the defendant had a reasonable opportunity to reflect upon his or her actions and nevertheless resumed sexually assaultive behavior. neither the duration of time between crimes, nor whether or not the defendant lost or abandoned his or her opportunity to attack, shall be, in and of itself, determinative on the issue of whether the crimes in question occurred on separate occasion 10 7 3. trial in apprendi v. new jersey (2000) 530 u.s. 466, 490 [120 s.ct. 2348, 147 l.ed.2d 435] (apprendi) the united states supreme court held any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum, other than a prior conviction, must be submitted to the jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. in alleyne v. united states (2013) 570 u.s. ___ [133 s.ct. 2151, 186 l.ed.2d. 314] (alleyne) the court held apprendi applies with equal force to facts increasing the mandatory minimum penalty for an offense. based on his mistaken assertion his five consecutive indeterminate life terms (aggregating 95 years to life) were imposed under section 667.6, subdivision (d), ortiz mandatory sentencing scheme must be made by the jury, rather than determined by the sentencing judge. we seriously doubt whether imposition of mandatory, consecutive full term are the functional equivalent of elements of an offense. we need not resolve that question, however, because it is now well established that the trial discretion to impose consecutive sentences, as occurred in the case at bar, does not fall within the rule of apprendi. (see oregon v. ice (2009) 555 u.s. 160, 164, 168 [129 s.ct. 711, 172 l.ed.2d 517] [sixth amendment does not preclude states from assigning to 7 the penalty prescribed for a felony violation of section 311.4 is 16 months, two years or three years. (see  311.9, subd. (b), 1170, subd. (h).) the trial court erred in imposing a consecutive sentence of one third the middle term (eight months) for this offense, rather than selecting one of the full triad terms (upper, middle or lower) and deciding whether it should be served consecutively or concurrently, since this was the single determinate term offense for which ortiz was convicted. (see, e.g., people v. rodriguez (2012) 207 cal.app.4th 204, 210-211 [trial court separately determines sentence to be imposed for indeterminate term crimes and determinate term crimes].) accordingly, the case must be remanded for resentencing as to count 3 only. 11 judges, rather than to juries, the finding of facts necessary to the imposition of consecutive, rather than concurrent, sentences for multiple offenses]; people v. mckinzie (2012) 54 cal.4th 1302, 1369 [both the united states and california supreme courts have rejected the claim that any factfinding engaged in by the trial court in justifying consecutive sentences violates the right to a jury trial].) disposition the consecutive sentence of a determinate term of eight months on count 3, using a minor as a model for a sexual act ( 311.4, subd. (c)), is vacated and the matter remanded for resentencing as to that count only. in all other respects the judgment is affirmed. perluss, p. j. we concur: woods, j. segal, j.* * judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
