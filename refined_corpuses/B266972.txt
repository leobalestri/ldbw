(see people v. shabazz (2015) 237 cal.app.4th 303, 308 & fn. 2; people v. rivera (2015) 233 cal.app.4th 1085, 1091.) as amended by proposition 47, health and safety code section 11350 now provides that a violation of that section is a misdemeanor unless the defendant has one or more prior convictions for an offense specified in section 667, subdivision (e)(2)(c)(iv) super strike 1 statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise indicated. 3 offensesor for an offense that requires the defendant to register as a sex offender under section 290, subdivision (c). (rivera, at p. 1092.) proposition 47 also created a new resentencing/reclassification provision. under hat is now a misdemeanor under proposition 47 may petition for a recall of that sentence and request resentencing in accordance with the statutes that were added or amended by proposition 47. ( 1170.18, subd. (a).) before resentencing an otherwise eligible petitioner, however, the court must determine whether resentencing would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. ( 1170.18, subd. (b).) the petitioner is subject to a new, one-year parole term unless the court releases the petitioner from parole as part of its resentencing order. ( 1170.18, subd. (d).) section 1170.18 also provides that person who has completed his or her hat would now be a misdemeanor under proposition 47 may file an application with the trial court to have the felony conviction or convictions .) section 1170.18, subdivision (k), subdivision (b) or designated as a misdemeanor under subdivision (g) shall be considered a misdemeanor for all purposes, except that such resentencing shall not permit that person to own, possess, or have in his or her custody or control any firearm or prevent his or her conviction under [ 29800 to 29875, which contain prohibitions on firearm access by 2. dismissals under section 1203.4 section 1203.4, subdivision (a)(1), provides that a defendant placed on probation who fulfills the conditions of probation for the entire period may withdraw his or her guilty plea or plea of no contest and enter a not guilty plea, or, if convicted following a trial, the court must set accusations or information against the defendant . . . . with certain exceptions the effect . . be released from all penalties and 4 disabilities resulting from the offense of which he or she has been convicted . . . .

(ibid.) conviction under provisions of the penal code prohibiting firearm access by individuals convicted of specified offenses. ( 1203.4, subd. (a)(2).) although a dismissal pursuant to section 1203.4 restores certain rights and removes certain disabilities, this statutory language plainly limits the effect of the ]he conviction may be treated as if it were not a conviction for most people v. guillen ibid.; accord, people v. frawley (2000) 82 cal.app.4th 784, 791.) as courts have observed, declaring that an order under section 1203.4 is ineffectual to avoid specified consequefrawley, at p. 791 [citing statutes including veh. code,  13555 (revocation or suspension of privilege to drive a motor vehicle); bus. & prof. code,  490 (suspension or revocation of professional license)]; see people v. vasquez (2001) 25 released pursuant to penal code section 1203.4, do not include nonpenal restrictions or .) perhaps most significantly, as just in any subsequent prosecution of the defendant for any other offense, the prior conviction may be pleaded and proved . . . .see frawley, at pp. 791-792 [describing 5 3. the trial court retains jurisdiction to reclassify a felony conviction that has been dismissed under section 1203.4 our colleagues in the sixth district recently considered the precise issue presented by manfelony conviction that has been dismissed under section 1203.4. (people v. tidwell (2016) 246 cal.app.4th 212.) we fully agree with their analysis and conclusion. under the plain meaning of section 1170.18, subdivision (f), manson was entitled to apply for proposition 47 relief: he was convicted in 2002 and 2004 of felony violations of health and safety code section 11350, subdivision (a). those felonies would have been misdemeanors had proposition 47 been in effect at the time of the offenses. having fulfilled the conditions of probation for the prescribed term, manson has completed his sentence for those convictions within the meaning of section 1170.18, subdivision (f). (people v. tidwell, supra, 246 cal.app.4th at p. 218; see people v. elliot (2005) 37 principles that govern our construction of a statute. [citation.] we turn first to the statutory language, giving the words their ordinary meaning. [citation.] if the statutory people v. king 2 2 it includes a term in the county jail as a conditpeople v. daniels (2003) 106 cal.app.4th 736, 742), there is some question whether a probationer can petition for relief under section 1170.18, subdivision (a), or must wait until he or she has completed probation to seek reclassification under section 1170.18, subdivision (f). (see couzens & persons who may petition for relief,  iv.a.4, at p. 35.) however that question may be resolved, there is nothing in proposition 47 to suggest an individual such as manson who has been convicted of a felony and completed his term of probation is not entitled to seek reclassification of that conviction as a misdemeanor. (id. at p. 36; see people v. davis (2016) 246 cal.app.4th 127 [rejecting argument defendant on probation is entitled to an unconditional reduction of his felony conviction without petitioning for relief under 6 moreover, nothing in the language of section 1170.18 indicates an otherwise eligible individual who has obtained a dismissal of his or her felony conviction under section 1203.4 is precluded from seeking reclassification of that conviction, which, as discussed, continues to carry potentially serious adverse consequences. indeed, proposition 47 act 18, couzens & (feb. 2016) appendix i: text of proposition 47, at p. 116.) ize 47,  2, couzens & bigelow, at p. 102.) to preclude relief under section 1170.18, subdivision (f), for an eligible individual who has successfully completed probation and obtained a section 1203.4 dismissal would frustrate that intent. (see people v. tidwell, supra, 246 cal.app.4th at p. 219.) as the tidwell court explained, case law considering a closely analogous situation strongly supports this conclusion. in meyer v. superior court (1966) 247 cal.app.2d 133 the trial court had denied an application pursuant to section 17, subdivision (b)(3), to declare a felony conviction for writing checks drawn on insufficient funds ( 476a) a misdemeanor, ruling it lacked the power to do so. (meyer, at p. 136.) the meyer court ordered a peremptory writ of mandate requiring the superior court to hear the motion on its merits, concluding dismissal of charges under section1203.4 did not preclude relief under section 17: under section 1203.4 is also a reward for good conduct and has never been treated as obliterating the fact that the defendant has been convicted of a felony. . . . [] therefore, a conviction which has been expunged still exists for limited purposes, including, among others, evidentiary use at a later trial [citation] and the denial of the right to carry a concealable weapon [citation]. consequently, petitioner should not be barred from pursuing a more suitable remedy, for a felony conviction .) 7 particularly where the final decision as to whether he is worthy rests within the sound (id. at p. 140.)3 the reasoning of the meyer court applies with equal force here. just as a court retains jurisdiction following a section 1203.4 dismissal to reduce a felony conviction to a misdemeanor pursuant to section 17, subdivision (b)(3), it similarly retains jurisdiction to grant relief, if otherwise warranted, under section 1170.18, subdivision (f). disposition the postjudgment orders denying mafelony convictions for possession of a controlled substance as misdemeanors are reversed and the cause remanded for the superior court to consider the applications on their merits. perluss, p. j. we concur: zelon, j. blumenfeld, j.* 3 when the superior court indicated it had no jurisdiction and intended to deny briefing on the issue and specifically noted that meyer v. superior court, supra, 247 cal.app.2d 133 appeared to support his argument that the matter was properly before the court. the request was denied. * judge of the los angeles county superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
