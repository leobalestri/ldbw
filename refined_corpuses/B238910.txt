(c)),1 one count of unlawful taking or driving of an automobile ( 666.5; veh. code,  10851) and one count of misdemeanor evading (veh. code,  2800.1, subd. (a)). the trial court found that diaz suffered one prior strike conviction ( 667, subds. (b)-(i), 1170.12, subds. (c)-(f)), two prior serious felony convictions ( 667, subd. (a)(1)), and two prior prison terms ( 667.5, subd. (b)). diazs total sentence was 26 years two months. with respect to the misdemeanor evading count, the trial court stated that diaz is ordered committed to the department of corrections for [a] period of [six] months to run consecutive with [the sentence on count one for assault on a peace officer]. regarding the same count for misdemeanor evading, the sentencing minute order stated that diaz was sentenced to serve 6 months in los angeles county jail. the abstract of judgment provided: as to [the misdemeanor evading count], [diaz] to serve 6 months in l.a. county jail and may be served in any penal institution. 1 all further statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise indicated. 3in people v. diaz (oct. 19, 2005, b170801) [nonpub. opn.], we vacated one of the two 5-year serious felony conviction enhancements and reduced diazs sentence from 26 years and two months to 21 years and two months. on december 6, 2011, diaz filed a petition for writ of mandate that argued, inter alia, for the recalculation of conduct credits. the petition was denied and he appealed in case no. b238910. on april 16, 2012, diaz moved to correct the abstract of judgment to reflect that the six-month misdemeanor sentence for evading in violation of vehicle code section 2800.1, subdivision (a) is not included in the state prison portion of the sentence. when the motion was denied, diaz appealed in case no. b241417. we consolidated diazs two appeals. discussion misdemeanor evading of a peace officer in violation of vehicle code section 2800.1, subdivision (a) is punishable by imprisonment in county jail for not more than one year. thus, the consecutive sentence of six months in prison for violating vehicle code section 2800.1, subdivision (a) must be stricken. (people v. harbolt (1988) 206 cal.app.3d 140, 160.) as a result, diazs prison term is be reduced to a total of 20 years and eight months. because the trial court determined that the term for evading is to be a consecutive sentence, diaz must serve six months in county jail at the conclusion of his modified prison sentence. (ibid.) diaz does not address the calculation of conduct credits in his appellate brief. we deem the issue waived. 4disposition the six-month prison sentence for violation of vehicle code section 2800.1, subdivision (a) is vacated and diazs prison sentence is reduced to 20 years eight months. the trial court is directed to prepare an abstract of judgment providing that diazs prison sentence is 20 years eight months and that when the prison sentence has concluded, he must serve six months in county jail. additionally, the trial court is directed to forward the new abstract of judgment to the department of corrections. in all other respects, the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. ______________________________, j. ashmann-gerst we concur: _______________________________, p. j. boren _______________________________, j. chavez
