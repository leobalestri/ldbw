(a))1; and possession of methamphetamine for sale ( 11378). after stiles admitted one prior strike conviction (pen. code,  667, subds. (b)(j), 1170.12) and seven prior prison terms (pen. code,  667.5, subd. (b)), he was sentenced to seven years in state prison. factual background on january 21, 2017, stiles was driving his car when officers conducted a traffic stop.2 an officer conducted a search and found a baggie of methamphetamine in center waistband, $111 in his right front pants pocket, and $392 in cash in his wallet. he did not appear to be under the influence of 1 all undesignated statutory references are to the health and safety code unless otherwise noted. 2 he was driving with a co-defendant who was also charged, but he is not party to this appeal. 3 drugs. he told the officer he had meaning he was carrying drugs, which he said was about an ounce and a half of methamphetamine. a criminalist quantified the amount as 47.121 grams. the officer who searched stiles did not believe that amount of methamphetamine was for personal use. an expert testified that the average methamphetamine dose is between 0.05 and 0.10 grams, so 47 grams can supply close to 1,000 hits, and it constituted an excessive amount for personal use. a methamphetamine user typically smokes between 0.20 and 0.40 grams per day, and heavy users can smoke up to a gram. about a quarter ounce a day, which amounts to approximately seven grams. the expert further testified that methamphetamine sellers often hide methamphetamine in their waistbands. in response to a hypothetical question tracking the facts of the case, the expert opined that having 47 grams hidden in a waistband, having over $500 in cash, and having no smoking paraphernalia indicate that an individual is in possession of the drug for the purpose of selling it. discussion i. sufficient evidence supported transportation of methamphetamine for sale section 11379, subdivision (a) imposes imprisonment of . . . any amphetamine.3 (people v. 3 otherwise provided in subdivision (b) and article 7 (commencing with section 4211) of chapter 9 of division 2 of the business and 4 martinez (2018) 4 cal.5th 647, 650 (martinez).) the statute originally prohibited transporting controlled substances for any reason, but the legislature amended it in 2013 to define . ( 11379, subd.

(martinez, supra, 4 cal.5th at p. 650; people v. emmal (1998) 68 cal.app.4th 1313 (emmal) [driving vehicle 20 feet sufficient].) in rejecting limits, these cases rely on the purposes behind prohibiting transportation of controlled substanceslegislature was entitled to assume that the potential for harm to others is generally greater when narcotics are being transported from place to place, rather than merely held at one location. the legislature may have concluded that the potential for increased traffic in narcotics justified more severe penalties for (people v. rogers (1971) 5 cal.3d 129, 136137, fn. omitted (rogers); see ormiston, supra, 105 cal.app.4th a p. 683; lacross, supra, 91 cal.app.4th at p. 186; emmal, supra, 68 cal.app.4th at pp. 13161317.)4 4 rogers, ormiston, lacross, and emmal were all decided before the 2013 amendment limiting section 11379 to transportation of controlled substances for sale. but even after the amendment, the california supreme court cited this language from rogers 6 just as cases have found nothing in section 11379 to limit the distance or method of transporting controlled substances, we can identify nothing in the statute to require identifying a specific origin or destination in order for a defendant to imposing the limitation stiles seeks would severely undermine effort to impose stricter penalties on those who transport controlled substances in order to reduce the increased harm associated with transporting narcotics. (see emmal, supra, 68 cal.app.4th at pp. 1317any illicit transportation of controlled substances, a rule which refuses to set up an artificial threshold for distance is more likely though ormiston, lacross, and emmal rejected limits on facts in those cases to argue that the prosecution must offer evidence of either a specific origin or a specific destination. yet, none of these cases addressedlet alone heldthat identifying either the origin or necessary to a conviction. he also cites a comment in ormiston the requirement of volitional transport of methamphetamine from one location to another avoids any unwarranted extension of the statute to restrained minimal movement within a residence or other confined area that does not facilitat(ormiston, supra, 105 cal.app.4th at pp. 684685.) while true, that reasoning does not suggest that a specific, identified origin or destination is additionally required. drug transportation as a more serious crime than drug martinez, supra, 4 cal.5th at p. 654.) 7 having concluded that evidence of a specific origin or destination is not determine whether sufficient evidence showed he transported the methamphetamine on hfrom one place to another for sale. (lacross, supra, 91 cal.app.4th at p. 185.) challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence to support a conviction, we review the entire record in the light most favorable to the judgment to determine whether it contains substantial evidencethat is, evidence that is reasonable, credible, and of solid valuefrom which a reasonable trier of fact could find the favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable support of the judgment the existence of every fact the trier could people v. maciel (2013) 57 cal.4th 482, 514515.) the evidence demonstrated that stiles was driving his vehicle with methamphetamine on his person, which itself strongly (if not conclusively) showed he was transporting the methamphetamine from one place to another. he admitted he was carrying the drugs, and officers found 47.121 grams of methamphetamine in his waistband and over $500 in cash on his person. an expert testified that the quantity of methamphetamine exceeded the amount for personal use and the circumstances indicated stiles was in possession of the methamphetamine for the purpose of selling it. from this evidence, a jury could reasonably infer that appellant was transporting the methamphetamine in order to sell it, satisfying 8 section 11379. the evidence was sufficient to sustain his conviction. ii. stiles forfeited his challenge to the transportation for sale jury instruction the jury was instructed on the elements of section 11379 with caljic no. 12.02, which defined as to transport 5 stiles contends the court erred by not instructing the jury with calcrim no. 2300, which further instructs that [a] person transports for sale if he or she carries or moves something from one location to another for sale, even if the d stiles did not request calcrim no. 2300 in the trial court or object to the instruction actually given. he argues no request or objection in calcrim no. 2300 was an element of the offense and the trial court had a sua sponte duty to give it. (people v. merritt to instruct the jury on the essential elements of the charged at most, however, the court was required to sua sponte instruct that for sale, which it did. (see people v. mccloud (2017) 15 cal.app.5th 948, 956 [parties agreed instruction for transportation of cocaine 5 s means to transport for sale. [] in order to prove this crime, each of the following elements must be proved: [] 1. a person transported methamphetamine, a controlled substance; and [] 2. that person knew of its presence and nature as a controlled substance; [] 3. that person transported the methamphetamine with the specific intent to sell it; and [] 4. that the substance was in an amount sufficient to be used or 9 base under section 1135and no objection was necessary].) beyond that, stiles was required to request any clarification of 11379, including the language contained in calcrim no. 2300. uty, in the absence of a request . . . people v. eastman (1993) 13 cal.app.4th 668, 673.) except for the recent statutory qualification that the transportation must be for sale, 79 has been given its nonlacross, supra, 91 cal.app.4th at p. 185commonly understood by jurors and . . . the word has not acquired a technical legal definition which would require the trial court to instruct the jury sua sponte people v. cortez (1985) 166 cal.app.3d 994, 999 [interpreting transportation of heroin under section 11352].) thus, stiles has forfeited his claim.6 6 we encourage the trial court to use the calcrim instructions approved by the judicial council in future cases instructions is strongly encouraged. if the latest edition of the jury instructions approved by the judicial council contains an instruction applicable to a case and the trial judge determines that the jury should be instructed on the subject, it is recommended that the judge use the judicial council instruction unless he or she finds that a different instruction would more accurately state the law and be understood by jurors. whenever the latest edition of the judicial council jury instructions does not contain an instruction on a subject on which the trial judge determines that the jury should be instructed, or when a judicial 10 disposition the judgment is affirmed. bigelow, p.j. we concur: rubin, j. dunning, j.* council instruction cannot be modified to submit the issue properly, the instruction given on that subject should be accurate, br * judge of orange superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
