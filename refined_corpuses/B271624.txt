(see  1170.18, subs. (f), (g).) on february 22, 2016, the trial court granted the petition. shortly thereafter, perea filed a second petition requesting the court to strike the section 667.5(b) enhancement that had been imposed on him in 2008 because the underlying drug offense no longer qualified as a felony. the trial court denied the petition. 1 unless otherwise noted, all further statutory citations are to the penal code. 3 discussion perea argues that under the sentencing provisions set forth in proposition 47, the trial court was required to strike the one-year section 667.5(b) enhancement that was imposed as part of his sentence in 2008 because the offense underlying that enhancement has since been designated as a misdemeanor. a. summary of relevant statutes and case law 1. summary of sections 667.5(b) and 1170.18 this case involves the application of two statutes: the prior prison term sentencing provision, set forth in section 1170.18. (people v. jones (1993) 5 cal.4th 1142, 1148.) imposition of the enhancement usly convicted of a felony; (2) was imprisoned as a result of that conviction; (3) completed that term of imprisonment; and (4) did not remain free for five years of both prison 2 (people v. abdallah (2016) 246 cal.app.4th 736, 742 (abdallah); see also people v. tenner (1993) 6 cal.4th 559, 563.) courts sometimes refer to the fourth requirement, which exempts from the enhancement defendants who have not reoffended [citations.]. . . . custody and the commission of a new felony for any five-year period following 2 e the new offense is any felony for which a prison sentence . . . is imposed[,] . . . the court shall impose a one-year term for each prior separate prison term . . . for any felony; provided that no additional term shall be imposed under this subdivision for any prison term . . . prior to a period of five years in which the defendant remained free of both the commission of an offense which 4 discharge from custody or release on parole, [citationabdallah, supra, 246 cal.app.4th at p. 742.) the safe neighborhoods and schools act, commonly known as proposition 47 (hereafter proposition 47 or the act), and theft-related offenses misdemeanors, unless the offenses were committed by certain ineligible defendants. these offenses had previously been designated as either felonies or wobblers (crimes that can be punished as either felonies riviera, supra, 233 cal.app.4th at p. 1091.) proposition 47 also created section 1170.18, which establishes a mechanism for resentencing and reclassifying felony convictions for offenses that are now misdemeanors under the act. under section 1170.18, subdivision (a), a person felony sentence for an offense that is now a misdemeanor under proposition 47 may petition for a recall of that sentence and request resentencing in accordance with the statutes that were added or amended by proposition 47. a person who satisfies the criteria in section 1170.18 shall have his or her in its discretion, determines that resentencing the petitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to section 1170.18, subdivisions (f) and (g) provide that persons who have completed felony sentences for offenses that would now be misdemeanors under proposition 47 may file an application with the trial court to have their subdivision (k) (hereafter 1170.18(k))conviction that is recalled and resentenced under subdivision (b) or designated as a misdemeanor under subdivision (g) shall be considered a misdemeanor for all purposes, except that such resentencing shall not permit that person to own, possess, or have in his or her custody or control any firearm or prevent his or her conviction [for various fire the act further provides: diminish or abrogate the finality of judgments in any case not falling within .) 5 2. summary of recent decisions analyzing the effect of a section 1170.18 redesignation on a prior prison term enhancement in abdallah, supra, 246 cal.app.4th 736, this court considered the effect of a proposition 47 reclassification on a prior prison term enhancement. the defendant in abdallah was charged with several felony counts, including possession of methamphetamine while armed with a firearm (health & saf. code,  11370.1). the information included a special allegation under section 667.5(b) asserting that the defendant had served a term of imprisonment for a prior felony conviction in 2002, and was then convicted of a second felony in 2011 (resulting in a suspended sentence) that he had committed within five years of completing his term on the 2002 conviction. in june of 2014, a jury convicted the defendant of the offenses charged in the information. prior to sentencing, the defendant obtained an order under section 1170.18 recalling his 2011 felony conviction, and reclassifying it as a misdemeanor. at sentencing, the trial court imposed a one-year enhancement under section 667.5(b), concluding that the prosecution had established the defendant had served a prior prison term for a felony conviction (the 2002 conviction), and then committed a second felony within five years of his completion of that prison term (the 2011 conviction). on appeal, the defendant argued that the section 667.5(b) enhancement specifically, he argued that because his 2011 felony conviction had been reclassified as a misdemeanor under proposition 47, he had not committed a felony conviction within five years of completing his prison term for the 2002 felony conviction. the attorney general, however, argued that the proposition 47 reclassification had no efconviction was a felony at the time he had committed that offense. vision (k), from section 17, subdivision (b), which describes the effect of a judicial declaration that a wobbler offense is a misdemeanor. (see  17, subd. (b)(3) [where a crime is a . . . [w]hen . . . the court abdallah, supra, 246 cal.app.4th at p. 745.) we further explained that in people v. park (2013) 56 6 cal.4th 782 (park), the supreme court had  667, subd. (a)) that the trial court had imposed based on an offense that another court had previously declared to be a misdemeanor under section rior proceeding properly exercised its discretion by reducing the [felony] conviction to a misdemeanor, that offense no longer qualified as a prior serious felony within the meaning of section 667, subdivision (a), and could not be used, under that provisi [citation.] the court observed generally precludes its use as a prior felony conviction in a subsequent abdallah, supra, 246 cal.app.4th at pp. 745-746 [citing and quoting park, supra, 56 cal.4th at p. 794].)

[the fourth requirement of] [s]ection 667.5, subdivision (b) excludes from the prior prison term enhancement a defendant nor been subject to [a prison term] within five years of release on parole or official discharge from asentence and resentenced him to a misdemeanor, section 1170.18, subdivision (k), reclassified that conviction as a misdemeanor [citation.] therefore, at the time of sentencing . . ., [the defendant] was not a within five years after his release on parole for his prior conviction. [citations.] thus, the trial court erred by imposing the one-year sentence abdallah, supra, 246 cal.app.4th at p. 746.) in people v. evans (2016) 6 cal.app.5th 894 (evans)), district four agreed with abdallah reasoning, and concluded prohibits a court from imposing a section 667.5(b) enhancement based on an id. at p. 901.) although abdallah considered the effect of a proposition 47 reclassification in the context of section 667.5(b)element (the wash out rule), evans 7 concluded the same analysis applied to section 667.5(b), which requires proof that the defendant was previously convicted of a felony. . . (abdallah, supra, 246 cal.app.4th at p. 742.) citing abdallah and park, the evans court explained that once a trial court has reclassified a prior felony offense to be a misdemeanor, the section 1170.18(k) prohibits the offense from serving as the basis for any subsequent section 667.5(b) enhancement. b. section 1170.18 does not apply retroactively to invalidate a section 667.5(b) enhancement imposed in a judgment that became final prior to proposition in this case, perea argues that once a prior felony conviction has been designated a misdemeanor pursuant to section 1170.18, the conviction cannot support a section 667.5(b) enhancement, even if the enhancement was imposed as part of a sentence that became final before proposition 47 was enacted. thus, perea contends that a redesignation of a prior felony conviction under proposition 47 applies both prospectively, barring a court from imposing a section 667.5(b) enhancement based on any offense that has previously been designated a misdemeanor, and retroactively, invalidating any section 667.5(b) enhancement that was imposed and became final before proposition 47 was enacted, and before the redesignation occurred. abdallah and evans sups contention that once a felony offense has been designated as a misdemeanor under section 1170.18, the offense cannot support a section 667.5(b) enhancement in any subsequent proceeding. neither case, however, considered whether proposition 47 allows a trial court to retroactively strike a section 667.5(b) enhancement where, as here, the enhancement was imposed in a judgment that became final prior to enactment.3 indeed, in both cases the courts specifically 3 the california supreme court has granted review in several cases that addressed this issue, all of which concluded that a redesignation order does not invalidate a previously-imposed section 667.5(b) enhancement that became final prior to proposition 47see people v. valenzuela, review granted march 30, 2016, s232900 (lead case); people v. carrea, review granted april 27, 2016, s233011; people v. williams, review granted may 11, 8 noted that they were not required to address that issue. (see abdallah, supra, 246 cal.app.4th at pp. 746-747 [explaining that case did not involve a retroactive application of proposition 47 because the underlying conviction was redesignated as a misdemeanor before the enhancement was imposed]; evans, supra, 6 cal.app.5th at p. 901 [clarifying that defendant was prison prior enhancements imposed prior to proposition 47 based on prior convictions designated as misdemeanors after judgment and sentence have robert l. v. superior court (2003) 30 cal.4th 894, 900.) retroactively is, at least in the first instance, a matter of legislative intent. when the legislature has not made its intent on the matter clear with respect to a particular statute, the legislatu. . .

(brown, supra, 54 cal.4th at p. 320.) 2016, s233559; people v. ruff, review granted may 11, 2016, s233201; people v. jones (2016) 1 cal.app.5th 221, 229, review granted sept. 14, 2016, s235901 (jones).) 9 applying those pra proposition 47 redesignation is intended to apply retroactively to invalidate past sentencing enhancements that became final prior to its enactment. proposition 47 does not contain any language declaring that its provisions are automatically retroactive. instead, the initiative sets forth two mechanisms that allow certain categories of offenders to seek redesignation and resentencing on certain categories of felony convictions that have become final. firscurrently serving a sentence for a felony that would now be a misdemeanor may petition for recall of the felony and resentencing as a misdemeanor. ( 1170.18, subds. (a), (b).) second, a for a felony that would now be a misdemeanor may petition for redesignation of that offense to a misdemeanor. as the fourth district explained in jones, supra, 1 cal.app.5th at p. 229, rev. granted, neither of these procedures provides a mechanism to retroactively strike a previously-imposed sentence not enhancements. neither procedure provides for either the recall and resentencing or the redesignation, dismissal, or striking of sentence enhancements. [citations.] no similar provision provides a process for offenders to seek to strike or otherwise redesignate sentencing enhancements. it follows that nothing in the language of section 1170.18 allows or even contemplates the retroactive redesignation, dismissal, or striking of sentence enhancements imposed in a final judgment entered before proposition 47 passed, even where the offender succeeds in having the id. at pp. 228-229.) moreover, section 1170.18, subdivision (n) expressly states that othing in this and related sections is intended to diminish or abrogate the reading a third mechanism into proposition 47 that allows offenders to would effectively contravene this provision. because previously-imposed sentence , we must avoid any interpretation of section 1170.18 that would diminish their finality. 10 perea, however, argues that section 1170.18(k), which states that a misdemeanor for all purp provides a statutory basis for retroactively striking a section 667.5(b) enhancement. perea appears to contend that the phrase collateral effect of a redesignated offense, including sentence enhancements. as we explained in abdallah, supra, 246 cal.app.4th 736, borrowedlanguage in section 17(b), which describes the effect of a judicial declaration that a wobbler offense is a misdemeanor. (id. at p. 745.) our supreme section 17(b) to operate prospectively, explaining that once a wobbler offense has been declared a misdemeanor, nse is a misdemeanor from that point (people v. feyrer (2010) 48 cal.4th 426, 439; see also park, supra, 56 cal.4th at pp. 794 [misdemeanor under . . . section 17(b) generally precludes its use as a prior ]; rivera, supra, 233 cal.app.4th at p. . . the people v. moomey (2011) 194 cal.app.4th 850, 857 [misdemeanor status of a . . our courts have further concluded that, given its identical language designating a felony as a misdemeanor), section 1170.18(k) should be interpreted in the same manner as section 17(b). (rivera, supra, 233 cal.app.4th at p. 1100; abdallah, supra, 246 cal.app.4th at p. 746; cf. people v. cornett (2012) 53 cal.4th 1261, 1269, fnin separate statutory provisions should receive the same interpretation when in re jerry r. y construed and a subsequent statute on a similar subject uses identical or substantially similar language, the usual presumption is that the legislature consistent with our supreme courtinterpretation of section 17(b) 11 (rivera, supra, 233 cal.app.4th at p. 1100.)4 in sum, we conclude that because section 1170.18 provides no procedure for dismissing or striking sentence enhancements that were imposed, and became final, prior to proposition 47infer voters intended the act to apply retroactively to past sentence enhancements. in the absence of any express language allowing the dismissal of past , precluding future sentence enhancements based on felony convictions redesignated as misdemeanors under proposition 47.5 4 defendant cites park, supra, 56 cal.4th 782 and people v. flores (1979) 92 cal.app.3d 461 (flores), in support of his argument that section 1170.18(k) requires retroactive application of the act to allow the dismissal or striking of a sentence enhancements that was imposed before the underlying offense was redesignated. both cases are distinguishable, however, because both involved a prospective application of a redesignated offense. park held that the de current felony sentence could not be enhanced for a prior conviction that had been previously reduced to a misdemeanor under section 17(b). the court explained that once a wobbler has been [ed] . . . to a misdemeanor[,] . . . section 17(b) generally precludes its use as a prior felony conviction in a subsequent prosecution. (park, supra, 56 cal.4th at p. 794.) similarly, the court in flores sentence for selling heroin could not be enhanced based on a prior felony conviction for marijuana possession because the legislature had reduced the marijuana offense to a misdemeanor before the (see flores, supra, 92 cal.app.3d at p. 471.) in contrast to park and flores, the sentence enhancement at issue in this case was imposed, and became final, years before the felony underlying the enhancement had been redesignated as a misdemeanor. 5 because we conclude the plain and unambiguous language of section 1170.18 prohibits the dismissal of a sentence enhancement that became final analysis and arguments in the official ballot pamphlet show the voters 12 3. imposing the section 667.5(b) enhancement does not violate the equal protection clause perea additionally argues that even if proposition 47 was not intended to retroactively invalidate any section 667.5(b) enhancement that was predicated on an offense that has now been designated a misdemeanor, he is equal protection clauses of the u.s. and california constitut more specifically, perea contends that misdemeanors to the section [667.5(b)] enhancement, when going forward, those same individuals would not be subject to the enhancement[,] violates equal protection. there is no rational basis for treating perea differently than a person who has already had their prior conviction reduced to a misdemeanor under proposition 47, and now, should that person be sentenced to a new offense, not have the one year enhancement applied to him or her. the california supreme court has rejected claims that the state equal protection clause is violated where classes of criminal defendants are treated differently based on the effective date of a statute lessening the punishment for a particular offense. (see people v. floyd (2003) 31 cal.4th 179, 189 (floyd) intended proposition 47 to apply to previously-imposed sentence enhancements (people v. rizo (2000) 22 cal.4th 681, 685 (rizowhen the we refer intent, particularly the analyses and arguments contained in the official ballot pamphletmoore v. superior court (2004) 117 cal.app.4th 401, 406 fn. 6 [when the language of the statute itself is clear and unambiguous, [courts] need not concern [them]selves with the . . . ballot pamphletrule of liberal construction requires that we interpret proposition 47 retroactively.
