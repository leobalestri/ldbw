(a)), and possessing a controlled substance for sale (health & saf. code,  11351). the trial court found true specially pleaded allegations that montano had suffered two prior serious or violent felony convictions for assault with a deadly weapon in 1979 and 1983 and sentenced him under the three strikes law ( 1170.12, subds. (a)-(d), 667, subds. (b)-(i)) to an indeterminate state prison term of 25 years to life. on december 7, 2012 montano filed a petition for recall of his sentence and resentencing under proposition 36, which amended the three strikes sentencing scheme to provide, in general, that a recidivist is not subject to an indeterminate life term for a third strike felony that is neither serious nor violent, unless the offense satisfies other criteria identified in the statute.2 the amendments also allow inmates previously sentenced to 1 statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise indicated. 2 prior to proposition 36, the three strikes law provided that a defendant convicted of two prior serious or violent felonies would be subject to an indeterminate life sentence of at least 25 years to life upon conviction of a third felony, whether or not that felony was serious or violent. (see people v. superior court (kaulick) (2013) 215 cal.app.4th 1279, 1285-1286.) 3 indeterminate terms under the three strikes law to petition for recall of their sentences and resentencing to the term that would have been imposed for their crime had they been sentenced under the new sentencing provisions. ( 1170.126, subd. (a).) montano argued in his petition that his nonviolent third strike convictions for possession and sale of a controlled substance made him eligible for recall of sentence and resentencing under proposition 36. in their opposition to the petition the people described criminal background, including additional felony convictions suffered during his incarceration and a lengthy disciplinary history while in prison, and argued montano currently posed an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. (see  1170.126, subd. (f) [inmate eligible under proposition 36 shall be resentenced under new law termines that resentencing the petitioner would pose montano argued he had not engaged in any violent crime for more than five years, had a clean disciplinary history during that time and had not been involved in prison gang culture. he also emphasized his age (55 years old) and his deteriorating health as factors making it unlikely he would pose a risk to public safety. following a suitability hearing conducted over a three-day period, the court found montano posed an unreasonable risk to public safety and denied his petition. discussion as discussed, proposition 36 repeat offenders under the amended law, a defendant with two prior qualifying strike convictions is not subject to an indeterminate life sentence as a third strike offender when the current offense is neither serious nor violent ( 1170.126, subd. (e)(1)) and does not meet one of the criteria in section 667, subdivision (e)(2)(c)(i)-(iii) ( 1170.126, subd. (e)(2)), and ke convictions was for one of the offenses listed in section 667, subdivision (e)(2)(c)(iv) ( 1170.126, subd. (e)(3)). 4 convicted of non-violent, non-serious crimes like shoplifting and simple drug possession [to] information guide, gen. elec. (nov. 6, 2012) text of prop. 36,  6, p. 109.) as part of its goal of limiting indeterminate life sentences to serious or violent felony offenders, proposition 36 added section 1170.126, which permits inmates previously sentenced to life terms under an earlier version of the three strikes law to petition to recall their sentences and, if eligible for relief, to be resentenced to the term that would have been imposed for their crime under the new sentencing provisions. ( 1170.126, subd. (a).) even if the petitioner is otherwise entitled to be resentenced under the new three strikes law, however, the petition may be denied if resentencing the petitioner would pose an unreasonable ( 1170.126, subd. (f).) proposition 47, passed by the voters in november 2014 as part of the safe neighborhoods and schools act (voter information guide, gen. elec. (nov. 4, 2014) text of prop. 47,  14, p. 73), was designed to reduce the punishment for certain drug and theft offenses by reclassifying them from felonies to misdemeanors. like proposition 36, proposition 47 creates a postconviction procedure by which a person currently serving a sentence for a specifically identified drug or theft crime may petition for resentencing under the new law. if a proposition 47 petitioner meets certain eligibility requirements, he or she must be determines that resentencing the petitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to 1170.18, subd. (b).) under proposition 36 the court has broad discretion in determining whether an inmate poses a current danger to public safety. in making this determination, the court record of conviction and any other evidence the court determines to be relevant to the question whether imposing a new sentence would result in an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. ( 1170.126, subd. (g)(1)-(4).) 5 under proposition 47 to determine whether an inmate otherwise eligible for resentencing poses an unreasonable danger to public safety is more limited: within the meaning of section 667, subdivision (e)(2)(c)(iv). ( 1170.18, subd. (c).)3 montano specific to his suitability review and insists, had it done so, the court would have had no choice (based on his history) but to danger to public safety applies in proposition 36 cases has divided the courts of appeal and is currently pending in the supreme court.4 proponents of emphasized the identical language in propositions 47 (section 1170.18, subd. (b)) and 36 (section 1170.126, subd. (f))danger to public and observe section 1170.18, subdivision (c), specifically mandates used code. most appellate courts have rejected this incorporation of the narrow definition of section 1170.18, subdivision (c), however, emphasizing the vastly different purposes of the two statutory schemes: proposition 36 is directed to recidivists with a history of 3 the violent felony offenses identified in section 667, subdivision (e)(2)(c)(iv), include sexually violent offenses; certain sexual offenses against children including oral copulation, sodomy, sexual penetration, and lewd or lascivious conduct; homicide offenses; solicitation to commit murder; assault with a machine gun on a peace officer or firefighter; possession of a weapon of mas 4 the cases currently pending in the supreme court on this issue include people v. guzman (apr. 2, 2015, g049135) [nonpub. opn.], review granted, june 17, 2015, s226410; people v. davis (2015) 234 cal.app.4th 1001, review granted, february 26, 2015, s225603; and people v. valencia (2014) 232 cal.app.4th 514, review granted, february 18, 2015, s223825. 6 qualifying serious or violent felony convictions, while proposition 47 is concerned with relatively minor offenders guilty of nonserious and nonviolent theft and drug possession felonies. in addition, it has been observed that application of proposition to proposition 36 petitions would result in absurd and unintended consequences. for example, a court considering a proposition 36 petition from a serial pyromaniac could not consider if the inmate might commit further arson; or one hearing a petition from a sadist could not consider whether she might again commit mayhem because neither crime is identified in the narrow list of violent crimes to be considered in a proposition 47 case. in our view, those courts that have held proposition unreasonable risk of danger to the public inapplicable to petitions for resentencing under proposition 36 have the far better argument. accordingly, we hold the trial court did not apply an incorrect legal standard when denying under section 1170.126.5 disposition the june 16, 2015 order denying montanosection 1170.126 is affirmed. perluss, p. j. we concur: segal, j. blumenfeld, j.* 5 the legal issue of the applicability of proposition suitability determinations. he does not otherwise challenge the trial that he posed an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. * judge of the los angeles county superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
