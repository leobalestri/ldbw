(a); count 1); attempted first degree murder ( 664/187, subd. (a); count 2); residential burglary ( 459; count 3); rape ( 261, subd. (a)(2); count 4); resisting an executive officer ( 69; counts 56); and dissuading a witness ( 136.1, subd. (b)(1); counts 78). as to count 1, the information also alleged that defendant personally used a deadly weapon (a knife). ( 12022, subd. (b)(1).) defendant pled not guilty and denied the allegation. 1 all undesignated statutory references are to the penal code. 3 after a jury trial at which he testified in his own defense, defendant was found guilty of counts 1, 3, and 58. as to count 1, the jury also found the deadly weapon allegation true. the jury was unable to reach verdicts on counts 2 and 4, and the court later dismissed them. the court sentenced defendant to an aggregate determinate term of 2 years 8 months consecutive to an indeterminate term of 26 years to life. for the determinate term, the court selected count 5 ( 69) as the base term and sentenced defendant to the midterm of two years. the court imposed 8 months for count 7 ( 136.1, subd. (b)(1))one-third the midterm of two yearsto run consecutively, plus full-term concurrent sentences for counts 3 ( 459), 6 ( 69), and 8 ( 136.1, subd. (b)(1))the upper term of six years for count 3, the middle term of two years for count 6, and the middle term of two years for count 8. for the indeterminate sentence, the court imposed the mandatory term of 25 years to life for count 1 ( 187, subd. (a)) plus one year for the knife enhancement ( 12022, subd. (b)(1)), to run consecutively. defendant filed a timely notice of appeal. factual background sarah met defendant in october 2009 and moved in with him soon after. they married in may 2010. she has two children, one of whom is sarah moved with defendant and the children to a second-story two-bedroom apartment in gardena. on july 9, 2014, sarah began dating robert villagran. two weeks later, she told defendant she wanted to separate. defendant finally moved out of the gardena apartment in september 2014 after sarah got a restraining order against him. 4 she had the locks changed the following month, and was in the process of getting a divorce. on december 22, 2014, at around 2:00 a.m., defendant broke into the apartment through a window.2 sarah awoke to a crashing sound. she got out of bed to investigate, and saw defendant crouched down in the living room. sarah screamed, at that point, villagran walked out of the bedroom and into the hallway. defendant had never seen him before. defendant villagran with his fists raised. defendant was cursing at doing here in my house, in my bed?villagran, and they began to fight. during the fight, defendant and villagran backed into the bedroom and fell onto the bed. sarah tried unsuccessfully to separate them. she heard villagran scream. sarah got off the bed and saw defendant standing over villagran, stabbing him. at that point, the children came into the room and started screaming. defendant picked them up and put them back to bed, then villagran. when sarah tried to get between them, defendant threw her to the edge of the bed, got on top of her, choked her, and tried to break her neck. 2 discovered on the window. surveillance footage from a nearby business showed him entering the apartment through the window. 5 eventually, defendant got off sarah and went after villagran, who had gotten up. defendant knocked him to the ground, and villagran started crawling to the bedroom door. of herebut as villagran continued crawling out of the bedroom, defendant walked over to him, crouched down, and slit his throat. villagran died of three stab wounds to the neck: a seven-[ ] into the muscle of the neck nine-at severed the carotid artery, and a six-inch cut that severed the jugular vein ears, face, hands, wrists, back, chest, and abdomen. meanwhile, sarah had given her daughter her phone and told her to call 911. defendant snatched the phone away, and sarah begged him to call for help. defendant refused. he sarah neighbors had called the police after hearing sarah and the children screaming for help. sarah was in the shower when she heard a knock at the door. still naked, she ran out of the shower and crouched next to the children in the living room. defendant told the officers nothing was wrong. when they said they wanted to come in and see for themselves, defendant threw a box cutter 6 in a gift bag behind the christmas tree. the box cutter was covered in blood.3 defendant eventually opened the door and complied with the put his hands behind his head. the officers noticed defendant was bleeding from the head and that his hands were covered in blood. as defendant left the apartment he just killed someone, he e, but officers struggled with him until backup arrived. after about 10 minutes, the officers were able to subdue him and take him into custody. a search of mobile phone. defendant testified on his own behalf that he went to the apartment that night after waking up from a nightmare about his children. when he arrived, he thought he heard his son crying, so when no one answered his knocks, he entered through the window. defendant thought sarah might not be home because her brother said she had been neglecting the children and leaving them alone, so after checking on the children, defendant knocked on her bedroom door. she emerged with villagran, whom he had never seen before. both of them started yelling at and hitting defendant. as defendant turned to leave, he was hit from behind and fell to the ground. eventually, he began to fight back. though the details were blurry, defendant remembered being scared and thinking sarah and villagran were trying to kill him. 3 officers later recovered a small steak knife from the same gift bag. blo 7 defendant acknowledged that he owned the box cutter, but said he did not bring it with him when he broke into the apartment. discussion defendant contends the court erroneously denied his request to instruct the jury with calcrim nos. 522 and 570, concerning provocation and heat of passion. the people argue the court properly refused these instructions because they were not supported by substantial evidence and, in any event, any error was harmless. in response to our request for letter briefs, defendant also contends the court should have stayed his sentence for count 3 under section 654. the people argue multiple punishment was appropriate because defendant harbored distinct objectives during the burglary and the murder, and defendant committed acts of violence against both villagran and sarah. 1. any instructional error was harmless. 1.1. murder and felony murder the unlawful killing of a human being, or a fetus, with malice aforethought. ( 187, subd. (a).) malice may be express or implied. ( 188.) express malice is the intent to kill, conscious disregard that the natural and probable consequences of the act or actions were dangerous to human life. [ci(people v. gonzalez (2018) 5 cal.5th 186, 197.) not all murder requires the people to prove the defendant killed intentionally or with conscious disregard for life. (people v. rios (2000) 23 cal.4th 450, 460, fn. 6 (rios).) a killing may also become murder by operation of the felony-murder rule. 8 under the felony-murder rule, a homicide is murder when it occurs in the course of certain serious and inherently dangerous felonies. [citations.] in such cases, the intent to commit a dangerous felony that actually results in death is substituted for malice, thus establishing the extent of culpability appropriate to ibid.) felony-murder liability does not require an intent to kill, or even implied malice, but (people v. gonzalez (2012) 54 cal.4th 643, 654 (gonzalez).) ( being with malice . (people v. chun (2009) 45 cal.4th 1172, 1181.) people v. gonzalez, supra, 5 cal.5th at p. 197.) felony murder, on the other hand, is divided into degrees based on the felony the first degree; if not, the murder is of the second degree. gonzalez, supra, 54 cal.4th at p. 654.) burglary, the felony at issue here, is listed in section 189. 1.2. manslaughter an intentional, unlawful killing without malice is manslaughter. ( 192; rios, supra, 23 cal.4th at p. 460.) a defendant lacks malice and is guilty of voluntary manslaughter in limited, explicitly defined circumstances: either when the defendant acts in a sudden quarrel or heat of passion [citation], or when the defendant kills in unreasonable self-defensethe unreasonable but good faith belief in having to act in self-defense [citations]. people v. lasko (2000) 23 cal.4th 101, 108.) 9 negating the element of malice that otherwise inheres in such a homicide [citaprovocation has this effect because of the words of section 192 itself, which specify that an unlawful killing imperfect self-defense obviates malice because that most culpable of mental or serious bodily injury. (rios, supra, 23 cal.4th at p. 461.) as we have discussed, however, felony murder does not require malice. (gonzalez, supra, 54 cal.4th at p. 654.) accordingly, provocation and heat of passion are irrelevant to felony murder. (people v. robertson (2004) 34 cal.4th 156, 165, overruled on other grounds by people v. chun, supra, 45 cal.4th at pp. 11991201.) 1.3. instructions below here, the court instructed on murder, felony murder, voluntary manslaughter due to imperfect self-defense, and the legally exonerating effect of actual self-defense. but defendant also asked the court to instruct with calcrim nos. 570 and 522. calcrim no. 570 informs the jury that murder may be reduced to voluntary manslaughter if the defendant killed someone because of a sudden quarrel or in the heat of passion. calcrim no. 522 allows the jury to reduce malice murder from first degree to second degree if the defendant was provoked. the court refused both instructions based on its conclusion that the evidence of a sudden quarrel or heat of passion was too insubstantial for the theory to merit consideration by the jury. 10 defendant contends the court erred because the facts supporting the self-defense instructions also supported heat-of-passion and provocation instructions. (see, e.g., people v. breverman (1998) 19 cal.4th 142, 148, 162164 [error not to give heat-of-passion instruction where jury was instructed on both theories of self-defense]; people v. barton (1995) 12 cal.4th 186, 202203 [sufficient evidence supported giving both heat-of-passion and imperfect-self-defense instructions]; people v. st. martin (1970) 1 -of- -defense people v. millbrook (2014) 222 cal.app.4th 1122, 11381143 [error not to give provocation instruction in addition to imperfect self-defense instruction].) we do not reach that issue, however, because, as we explain below, any error was harmless.4 (people v. demetrulias (2006) 39 cal.4th 1, 24decide whether the trial court was required to instruct on heat-of-passion voluntary manslaughter, because any error in failing to constitutional errors].) 1.4. any error was harmless. even assuming the court committed instructional error, we will not reverse the judgment unless we also determine the error was prejudicial. but the law is presently unsettled on which prejudice test applies to the failure to instruct on heat of passion or provocation. (see people v. breverman, supra, 19 cal.4th at 4 point violated the california and federal constitutions by forcing defendant to testify to obtain the instructions. defendant has not raised that issue on appeal and we do not address it. 11 p. 170, fn. 19 [declining to decide issue]; id. at pp. 188191 (dis. opn. of kennard, j.) [suggesting the erroneous refusal of instructions on heat of passion is federal constitutional error due people v. moye (2009) 47 cal.4th 537, 558, fn. 5 [declining to decide issue]; people v. lasko, supra, 23 cal.4th at p. 113 [same]; people v. millbrook, supra, 222 cal.app.4th at pp. 1143the error was prejudicial even under state law]; people v. thomas (2013) 218 cal.app.4th 630, 641644 [on transfer from california supreme court, refusal to give requested instruction was federal constitutional error].) defendant argues the error violated his federal due process right to have the jury consider his theory of the case and every element of the crime, therefore requiring the people to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the error was harmless. (chapman v. california (1967) 386 u.s. 18, 2324.) the people assert the error is one of state law, which requires defendant to establish that it is reasonably probable he would have achieved a more favorable result absent the error. (people v. watson (1956) 46 cal.2d 818, 836.) we need not wade into this debate, however, because we conclude any error was harmless even under the more stringent chapman test. the people contend that because the jury found defendant acted willfully, deliberately, and with premeditation, it necessarily found that he did not act under the heat of passion; that the evidence was overwhelming; there was no evidence defendant was provoked; and that the jury could have relied on a felony-murder theory. defendant responds that because provocation and heat of passion can negate malice or raise doubts 12 about the presence of premeditation and deliberationconclusion that he acted with malice aforethought is not dispositive, numerous requests, and inability to reach verdicts on two counts indicate the case was close. he does not address felony murder. we agree beyond a reasonable doubt that any error was harmless in light of the error in failing to instruct the jury on a lesser included offense is harmless when the jury necessarily decides the factual questions posed by the omitted instructions adversely to people v. lewis (2001) 25 cal.4th 610, 646; people v. demetrulias, supra, 39 cal.4th at p. 25 [failure to instruct on heat-of-passion less, as the jury necessarily determined the killing was first degree murder, not in this case, the jurors were instructed on alternative theories of first degree murder: deliberate, premeditated murder with malice aforethought and felony murder. they were also instructed that they did not need to agree on which theory applied. (calcrim no. 548; see people v. moore (2011) 51 cal.4th 386, 412413 [lesser offenses of second degree murder and manslaughter are not legally available if defendant killed the victim in the commission of a burglary or robbery].) in closing argument, the prosecutor explained that the jury could convict on either theory. question that appellant fatally stabbed villagran13 we disagree. certainly, provocation or heat of passion can reduce an unlawful, intentional killing from first degree to second degree murder, or to voluntary manslaughter, by negating malice or by raising a reasonable doubt about the premeditation and deliberation element of first degree murder. (see rios, supra, 23 cal.4th at p. 461.) yet even assuming a properly instructed jury would have agreed that provocation or heat of passion negated malice and reduced the killing to voluntary manslaughter, or raised a reasonable doubt about whether defendant acted with premeditation and deliberation and reduced the killing to second-degree murder, that conclusion would not have helped defendant under the felony-murder theorybecause, as discussed, provocation and heat of passion are irrelevant to felony murder. (people v. robertson, supra, 34 cal.4th at p. 165.) and this jury was properly instructed on felony murder. the elements of felony murder by burglary are: the defendant committed or attempted to commit burglary; the defendant intended to commit burglary; and while committing or attempting to commit burglary, the defendant caused the death of another person. ( 189; see calcrim no. 540a.) here, the jurors convicted defendant of burglary. and they concluded he killed villagran. those conclusions, taken together, established that defendant was guilty of felony murder. no malice was required. indeed, the jury may well have accepted 14 that defendant acted in imperfect self-defense. (see, e.g., people v. balderas provocation can ever reduce a murder properly based on the felony-murder doctrine to voluntary manslaughter, and an people v. seaton (2001) 26 cal.4th 598, 613 -murder rule, a killing in the commission of certain felonies specified in [section] 189, is first degree murder, not manslaughter, even if the killer acts in unreasonable self- -murder rule, commission of burglary, together with the killing of the victim[ ] in the commission of the burglary, made him people v. cain (1995) 10 cal.4th 1, 31; people v. hardy (2018) 5 cal.5th 56, 100 [failure to instruct on provocation harmless where court also instructed on felony murder and jury found the predicate cessarily found that [the] murder was first degree murder under a felony- people v. visciotti (1992) 2 cal.4th 1, 57, fn. under properly given instructions that the murder was intentional, and was committed in the perpetration of the robbery, thus establishing that the killing was murder of the first degree under the felony-murder rule and section 189 without the necessity of proving malice. any error in failing to instruct on voluntary manslaughter was harmless. [citatio.) thus, even if the jury had been instructed on provocation and heat of passion, and even if the jury had accepted defendanttestimony that villagran and sarah attacked him, the verdict would be the same. accordingly, any error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. 15 2. count 3 must be stayed under section 654. under section 654, when a criminal defendant commits multiple offenses incident to a single objective, he may be punished for only one offense. (people v. latimer (1993) 5 cal.4th 1203, 1211.) whether a course of conduct is divisible depends on id. at pp. 12051206; neal v. state of california (1960) 55 cal.2d 11, 19.) that issue is a question of fact for the trial court. (people v. porter (1987) 194 cal.app.3d 34, 38.) we uphold all implied or express factual determinations supported by substantial evidence. (people v. osband (1996) 13 cal.4th 622, 730731.) here, the court opted to run count 3 (burglary) concurrently to the remainder of tthis conclusion was supported by substantial evidence because, as discussed, burglary was the predicate felony supporting the felony-murder conviction. based on its own factual finding, therefore, the court was required to stay count 3 under section 654.5 (see people v. islas (2012) 210 cal.app.4th 116, 129 [concurrent terms for false imprisonment should have been stayed when burglary was based entirely on entry with intent to commit false imprisonment].) 5 we disagree with the people that this language indicates the court believed defendant had separate intents. 16 disposition the judgment is modified to stay count 3 (pen. code,  459) under penal code section 654. as modified, the judgment is affirmed. upon issuance of the remittitur in this case, the court is directed to correct the june 27, 2016 minute order and the abstract of judgment to reflect the judgment as modified and to send a certified copy of the corrected abstract of judgment to the department of corrections and rehabilitation. not to be published in the official reports lavin, j. we concur: edmon, p. j. egerton, j.
