(pen. code,1  459.) appellant admitted two prison priors under section 667.5, subdivision (b) and a prior serious felony conviction under section 667, subdivision (a)(1) and the three strikes law. ( 667, subds. (b)(i), 1170.12, subds. (b)(d).) the trial court denied a defense romero2 motion and imposed an aggregate sentence of nine years in state prison.3 appellant contends the trial court erroneously instructed on first degree burglary by modifying calcrim no. 1701 and abused its romero motion. we disagree and affirm. factual background in 2016 francesco panzieri lived in a four-story apartment building with 30 to 40 residential units and an attached ground floor parking garage. the garage has three gated entrances/exits for cars and a pedestrian gate. each gate is controlled by a separate remote control. the apartments are accessible from the garage by an elevator requiring a separate access key. on may 2, 2016, approximately 9:00 a.m., panzieri went down to the garage from his apartment to get his motorcycle to 1 undesignated statutory references are to the penal code. 2 people v. superior court (romero) (1996) 13 cal.4th 497 (romero). 3 the sentence consisted of the low term of 2 years for the burglary, doubled to 4 years for the prior strike conviction ( 667, subd. (e)(1)), plus a consecutive 5-year term pursuant to section 667, subdivision (a)(1). 3 drive to work. panzieri had parked the motorcycle behind his orange mini cooper the night before, and had left his helmet on the motorcycle seat. panzieri found his motorcycle parked in its space, but the helmet was missing. after confirming that his girlfriend had not moved the helmet, and certain that he had left it on the motorcycle, panzieri called the police to report it stolen. surveillance video of the garage interior4 showed appellant ride a bicycle through an exterior gate about 10 seconds after the gate had opened to allow a car to exit. appellant looked around as he rode through the garage in between and around cars. motorcycle helmet in his right hand. discussion 1. the trial court properly instructed on the elements of first degree burglary. appellant contends the trial court improperly inserted the creating a mandatory presumption that the parking area was an occupied part of an inhabited dwelling house. appellant claims condominium complex) was a building for purposes of section 460 and whether a street level parking area beneath the apartments 1701, and conclude 4 videos from what appear to be motion-sensor surveillance cameras in the garage were played for the jury. 4 that the trial court properly instructed on all the elements required for first degree burglary. effectively directed an adverse finding against appellant by people v. posey (2004) 32 cal.4th 193, 218.) looking to the instructions as a whole, together with the trial record and the arguments of people v. ramos (2008) 163 cal.app.4th 1082, 1088.) in so doing, we assume that jurors are intelligent people, capable of understanding the jury instructions given. (ibid.) in the final analysis, we interpret the instructions, where reasonably possible, to support the judgment rather than defeat it. (people v. spaccia (2017) 12 cal.app.5th 1278, 1287; people v. ramos, supra, 163 cal.app.4th at p. 1088.) was not whether an apartment building qualifies as a building that could be burglarized, which it most certainly does, but whether appellant entered an inhabited dwelling place with the intent to commit a theft. an apartment is specifically listed in the statutory definition of burglary as one of the structures that can be burglarized.5 means currently being used for dwelling purposes, whether 5 section 459 provides in relevant part: o enters any house, room, apartment, tenement, shop, warehouse, store, mill, barn, stable, outhouse or other building . . . with intent to commit grand or petit larceny or any felony is guilty of 459.) 5 . . or the burglary in the first degree the jury must find the defendant entered an inhabited dwelling house with the intent to commit a felony. (people v. thorn (2009) 176 cal.app.4th 255, 261 (thorn).) inclusive definition, focusing on whether the dwelling is used as a residence. (people v. cruz (1996) 13 cal.4th 764, 776 (cruz); thorn, supra, 176 cal.app.4th at p. and which is currently being used for dwelling purposes. [citation.] a place is an inhabited dwelling if a person with possessory rights uses the place as sleeping quarters intending to cruz, supra, 13 cal.4th at p. 776; thorn, supra, 176 cal.app.4th at p. 261.) as applied here, there can be no debate that an apartment building is patently a dwelling house, and the apartment complex in this case was manifestly inhabited. what remains is the apartments did not constitute an inhabited portion of the not be in the first degree. innumerable courts have rejected structure is part of an inhabited dwelling, the essential inquiry is whether the structure is functionally interconnected with and immediately contiguous to other portions of the housefunctionally interconnectedcontiguouspeople v. rodriguez (2000) 77 cal.app.4th 1101, 1107 (rodriguez).) 6 numerous courts have found an attached garage to be functionally connected to the building to which it is attached, and thus part of the inhabited dwelling for purposes of first degree burglary.6 (see, e.g., people v. debouver (2016) 1 cal.app.5th 972, 981982 (debouver) [secured underground garage was integrated part of apartment complex]; people v. harris (2014) 224 cal.app.4th 86, 8990 [attached garage converted to guest room with no direct access to the main house was part of the inhabited dwelling]; thorn, supra, 176 cal.app.4th at pp. 262263 [carports located directly underneath apartments designated in re edwardo v. (1999) 70 cal.app.4th 591, 594 [garage attached to residential duplex with no direct access to living units qualifies as an inhabited dwelling house under  460]; people v. fox (1997) 58 cal.app.4th 1041, 1047 (fox) [trial court properly instructed jury that, when garage is attached to inhabited dwelling, it is considered part of the inhabited dwelling]; people v. ingram (1995) 40 cal.app.4th 1397, 1402, 1404 [garage with no direct access to house was functionally connected to residence where it shared roof with residence], overruled on other grounds in people v. dotson (1997) 16 cal.4th 547, 560.) 6 in this regard, our supreme court has explicitly acknowledged that an area such as an attached garage, even if it lacks direct access to the residence, nevertheless falls within the policies informing the law of first degree burglary. (cruz, supra, 13 cal.4th at p. 776.) 7 determining whether the garage was an inhabited portion of the apartment complex. but appellant misstates the relevant house may be accomplished even if the specific room that the burglar unlawfully enters is not a space where people live. in determining whether the defendant has burglarized an inhabited used for sleeping or everyday living, but whether the area is functionally interconnected to and immediately contiguous to the residence, which is used fo in re m.a. (2012) 209 cal.app.4th 317, 323, quoting rodriguez, supra, 77 cal.app.4th at p. 1110.) the precise instructional challenge appellant raises here was expressly rejected by the courts in thorn and fox. in both of these cases, as in the present case, the trial court instructed the jury that to find the defendant guilty of first degree burglary, it must find he burglarized an inhabited building, that a building is inhabited if it is used as a dwelling, and that a garage or carport that is attached to an inhabited dwelling is part of the inhabited dwelling, and not a separate structure. (thorn, supra, 176 cal.app.4th at p. 267; fox, supra, 58 cal.app.4th at p. 1047.) both courts reasoned that under these instructions the jury was required to determine whether the structure the defendant entered was inhabited, and whether the garage was attached and structure thorn, supra, 176 cal.app.4th at p. 268; fox, supra, 58 cal.app.4th at p. 1047.) in both cases, it was only upon resolution of these factual questions that the jury could find the defendant guilty of first degree burglary. so it is in the case at bar. by directing the jury to determine whether the apartment building was inhabited, and 8 whether the parking structure was attached to the apartment instruction on first degree burglary accurately stated the law and properly left the essential questions of fact to the jury. during oral argument in this case, appellant asserted that an apartment building parking garage, consisting of nothing more than lines painted on the floor with no designated areas for purposes of first degree burglary. in so arguing, appellant relies on people v. singleton (2007) 155 cal.app.4th 1332 (singleton). singleton held that a common area of an apartment building does e special finding under section 667.5, subdivision (c)(21) that elevates a first an accomplice, was present in the residence during the 7 (id. at pp. 13381339.) the court [indicates] the term was intended to refer to a location different 7 section 667.5, subdivision (a) calls for the imposition of a 3-year sentence enhancement where the defendant has served one or more prior prison terms and the new offense is one of the violent felonies specified in subdivision (c). subdivision (c) in shall mean any of the following: [] . . . [] (21) any burglary of the first degree, as defined in subdivision (a) of section 460, wherein it is charged and proved that another person, other than an accomplice, was present in the residence during the 9 id. at p. 1339.) singleton is misplaced, however. in singleton, there was no question that the burglary occurred in an degree. rather, the issue was whether a person standing outside subdivision (c)(21). on the other hand, people v. debouver, supra, 1 cal.app.5th 972 (which appellant asserts was wrongly decided) is directly on point. as in the instant case, the defendant in debouver burglarized a parking garage attached to an apartment complex. and as in singleton, the issue was not whether the burglary was of an inhabited dwelling and thus in the first requirement under section 667.5, subdivision (c)(21). but in an underground garage debouver distinguished singleton, holding that the underground garage, which shared a common roof with the apartment complex, was an integrated part of the dwelling. (debouver, supra, 1 cal.app.5th at p. 981, citing rodriguez, supra, 77 cal.app.4th at p. 1107.) the court concluded that because the burglary of the apartment complex garage qualified as a first degree burglary and the building manager was present during the crime, the burglary constituted a violent felony justifying the section 667.5, subdivision (a) enhancement. (debouver, supra, 1 cal.app.5th at p. 982.) 10 2. the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the romero motion. appellant contends the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to dismiss his prior strike conviction in accordance with romero. we disagree. second strike under the three strikes law. at the sentencing 2015 prior strike conviction for residential burglary under romero. counsel argued that prior to trial the prosecution had been willing to dismiss the prior strike allegation and offered a plea deal to second degree burglary for four years. defense counsel argued that because the value of the stolen property was only $150 and the burglary was not committed in any living quarters, a second strike sentence would be grossly disproportionate to the seriousness of the crime, and another similar conviction could result in a life sentence. romero motion, the trial court specifically found that the nature and circumstances of ctions did not place him outside the spirit of the three strikes sentencing scheme. the court noted that appellant had committed multiple felonies in just five years, and the prior strike he was seeking to dismiss was also a first degree burglary for which he had been released from custody only six months before committing the instant offense. in his lengthy criminal history, appellant had demonstrated no success on probation or parole. the court also took into account its choice of the low term for the current circumstances. 11 under section 1385 a trial court has discretion to strike a prior serious felony conviction for sentencing serious and/or violent felony convictions, and the particulars of his background, character, and prospects, the defendant may be part, and hence should be treated as though he had not previously been convicted of one or more serious and/or violent people v. williams (1998) 17 cal.4th 148, 161 (williamsprior under section 1385 for abuse of discretion. (people v. carmony (2004) 33 cal.4th 367, 376 (carmony); williams, supra, at p. the party attacking the sentence to clearly show that the sentencing decision was irrational or arbitrary. [citation.] in the absence of such a showing, the trial court is presumed to have acted to achieve legitimate sentencing objectives, and its discretionary determination to impose a particular sentence will not be set appellate tribunal is neither authorized nor warranted in [citations.] taken together, these precepts establish that a trial court does not abuse its discretion unless its decision is so irrational or arbitrary that no reasonable person could agree with carmony, supra, 33 cal.4th at pp. 376377.) as our supreme court has explained, the three strikes law presumption that any sentence that conforms to these sentencing norms carmony, supra, 33 cal.4th 12 at p. abuse its discretion in failing to strike a prior felony conviction allegation in limited circumstances. for example, an abuse of ibid.) the high e trial court balanced the relevant facts and reached an impartial decision in conformity with the spirit of the law, we shall affirm ances must be . . by which a career criminal can be deemed to fall outside the spirit of the very scheme within which he squarely falls once he commits a strike as part of a long and continuous criminal record, the continuation of which the law was meant to could disagree that the criminal falls outside the spirit of the ibid.) romero motion in the instant case, the trial court was plainly aware of its discretion to dismiss reasons intended to meet legitimate sentencing objectives. the trial court did not abuse its discretion. 13 disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published. lui, p. j. we concur: ashmann-gerst, j. chavez, j.
