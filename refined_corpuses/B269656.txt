(a)) and two counts of leaving the scene of an accident (veh. code,  20001, subd. (a)). the trial court found true allegations that defendant had suffered two (pen. code,  667, subds. (b)-(i) & 1170.12, subds. (a)-(d)).1 the trial court sentenced defendant to two consecutive terms of 25 years to life pursuant to the three strikes law.2 on march 22, 2013, defendant filed a petition for recall of sentence in the trial court, pursuant to section 1170.126.3 the trial court issued an order to show cause, and the parties filed written briefs addressing the issue of whether relief should be granted to defendant. after conducting a hearing on the issue, the trial court denied defendanuant to section 1170.126, subdivision (f). in a 21-page memorandum of decision, the trial 1 all further statutory references are to the penal code unless otherwise indicated. 2 defendant appealed the judgment of conviction, and on september 30, 2005, we affirmed the judgment. (people v. flowers (sept. 30, 2005, b175317) [nonpub. opn.].) 3 on march 6, 2013, defendant filed a petition in pro. per. his petition was forwardeconviction assistance center subsequently filed the operative petition for recall of sentence. 3 1170.18, subd. (c)) applies in the context of a petition under proposition 36 ( 1170.126). the trial court then detailed disciplinary history, rehabilitative programming, postrelease plans, and other relevant evidence. considering all this evidence, the trial court determined that resentencing defendant would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. defendant timely filed a notice of appeal. he argues that he is eligible for resentencing because (1) the three strikes law has a strong presumption that a defendant whose third strike is not violent or serious should not receive an indeterminate life sentence absent exceptional circumstances; (2) due process requires that a section 1170.126 petition be granted unless there is a rational nexus between the evidence in the record and a finding that the defendant currently poses an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety; (3) the language of proposition 47 .126 petitions for resentencing; and (4) the trial court erred by failing to apply the proper legal standard and by erroneously finding a nexus betwpast criminal conduct and the current risk of danger he poses to the public. we affirm. discussion i. there is no presumption in favor of resentencing defendant argues that he is entitled to resentencing pursuant to proposition 36, the three strikes reform act of 2012 (the act); he claims that he is subject to a second strike sentence. 4 here is no expectation or presumption that a petitioner under the act will be sentenced to a second strike sentence. this contention by defin subdivision (f) of section 1170.126. the court of appeal has previously rejected such a contention (people v. buford (2016) 4 cal.app.5th 886, 901903, review granted jan. 11, 2017, s238790) and defendant offers no compelling reason to depart from that holding. the act does not create an expectation or presumption that under its provisions a petitioner under the act would be resentenced as a second striker. in a similother words, a petitioner who is found eligible for section 1170.126 relief will also be found eligible for relief absent support in the statutory language. had the voters intended such relief, they would have said so, instead of employing language that affords broad discretion to find dangerousness. ii. no due process liberty interest at stake defendant contends that he has a liberty interest in resentencing under proposition 36 protected under the federal guarantee of due process of law (u.s. const., 5th & 14th amends.) and the comparable but broader state guarantee of due process of law (cal. const., art. 1,  7, subd. (a), 15). he argues recognized in [greenholtz v. inmates of nebraska penal & correctional complex (1979) 442 u.s. 1] and [board of pardons v. allen (1987) 482 u.s. 369] because it involves lessening the 5 he further points out that under the california constitution, our sdeprivatory governmental action, he always has a due process liberty interest both in fair and unprejudiced decision-making people v. ramirez (1979) 25 cal.3d 260, 268.) to protect such interest, he posits that when a resentencing petition is denied, a nexus must be established by some evidence on the record and the conclusion that the inmate poses a current risk of danger to public safety, after conducting a particularized assessment of the we are not persuaded by claim of a constitutional liberty interest in resentencing under proposition 36. first, for life sentences, there is a mandatory minimum amount of prison time that must be served before an inmate can be considered for parole. (see  3046.) section 1170.126, on the other hand, provides no mandatory minimum number of years that must be served before petitioning for a sentence reduction. in re lawrence (2008) 44 cal.4th 1181, 1202.) in other words, the statutory scheme provides defendants who are convicted of crimes carrying life an expectation that they will be granted parole unless the [parole] board finds, in the exercise of its discretion, that they are unsuitable for parole in light of the circumstances specified by statute and by regulation.in re lawrence, supra, at pp. 1191, 1204.) third strike prisoners have the same expectation of parole 6 associated with their life sentences, but their original sentence provided no expectation of a sentence reduction. a third difference is the mandatory language of the parole provisions. unlike section 1170.126, none of the relevant parole governor, while having gremust consider the statutory factors concerning parole suitability set (in re prather (2010) 50 cal.4th 238, 251, italics added.) in contrast, the trial coudangerousness. iii. proposition 47 definition of danger is inapplicable to proposition 36 defendant argues that the enactment of proposition 47 clarified the resentencing. on february 18, 2015, our supreme court granted review in people v. valencia (2014) 232 cal.app.4th 514 (valencia), s223825in the proposition 36 context is pending before that court in both valencia, supra, s223825, and people v. chaney (2014) 231 cal.app.4th 1391 (chaney) review granted, february 18, 2015, s223676. in view of the posture of this issue, we shall not belabor the point but simply conclude, as did the court in people v. esparza 7 (2015) 242 cal.app.4th 726 (esparza),4 that the voters in enacting proposition 47 did not intend for its definition of danger to extend to petitions under proposition 36, and thus such definition is inapplicable here. iv. the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying abuse of discretion. statutorily vested in the trial court, its exercise of that discretion except on a showing that the court exercised its discretion in an arbitrary, capricious or patently absurd manner that resulted in a manifest miscarriage of justice. [citations.]people v. rodrigues (1994) 8 cal.4th 1060, 11241125.) in a lengthy, detailed order, the trial court summarized the institutional behavior, rehabilitative programming, postrelease plans, psychological evaluation, and recidivism risk scores before denying his petition. the trial court relied on the language of section 1170.126 and cases governing the suitability for release 4 no petition for review was filed or review granted in esparza, which came from the sixth appellate district. in a subsequent sixth appellate district case, the majority noted that esparza was the only extant decision on this issue and rejected its conclusion. (people v. cordova (2016) 248 cal.app.4th 543, 552, fn. 8, review granted aug. 31, 2016, s236179 (cordova).) in granting review in cordova, the court deferred further action pending resolution of a related issue in chaney, supra, s223676, and valencia, supra, s223825. we decline to consider the cordova majority opinion persuasive on this point. (cal. rules of court, rules 8.1105, 8.1115.) 8 on paroits discretion. in urging us to reverse, defendant argues that the trial court failed to consider his rehabilitation in the context of his young age when he committed the current offenses, that there violations in prison, that d pose an unreasonable risk of danger to the community, and that discretion was arbitrary or capricious. rather, based upon discretion, [whether] resentencing [defendant] would pose an recognized that currently poses an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety if resentenced. the trial court then set forth the factors that it criminal history and the facts of the commitment offense. while defendant claims that the trial court failed to consider his age, the record shows otherwise. the trial court specifically current behavior. the tdiscipline and rehabilitation in prison. the trial court noted that dangerous acts in prison. also, the trial court found that his 9 possession of a cell phone constituted dangerous contraband because it could allow an inmate to conduct illicit activities outside of prison. defendant contends that there is no nexus between his past criminality and his rule violation for possession of a cell phone. indicative of his lack of rehabilitation and current criminality. (in re bettencourt (2007) 156 cal.app.4th 780, 805.) similarly, rule violations for controlled substances. defendant currently has a drug problem and, as the trial court found, his drug use escalated in prison. while there is no evidence that drug use was shows his lack of rehabilitation and current criminality. defendant has not rehabilitated himself in prison. instead, he acquired a drug problem and violated a prison rule prohibiting the possession and/or use of a controlled substance on prison grounds as a result. assessments for recidivism and his california department of corrections and rehabilitation classification score. as the trial evidence of current dangerousness. (in re stevenson (2013) 213 cal.app.4th 841, 869870.) the trial court considered dr. and still found him to pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. constitutes an abuse of discretion. 10 disposition the order is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. __________________________, acting p. j. ashmann-gerst we concur: ______________________________, j. chavez ______________________________, j. * goodman * retired judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
