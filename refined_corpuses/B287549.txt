(a).) here, however, defendant admitted a strike prior (pen. code,  667, subd. (d), 1170.12, subd. (b)) and three prior convictions under vehicle code section 10851. penal code section 666.5 increases the punishment for recidivist car thieves convicted of a felony violation of vehicle code section 10851. the trial court imposed a two-year felony sentence under penal code section 666.5, doubled to four years because of the strike prior. 2 penal code section 490.2 was added by proposition 47. (prop. 47,  8, eff. nov. 5, 2014.) except when a defendant has specified prior convictions, section 490.2 makes obtaining 3 petition, concluding defendant was ineligible for relief because he was convicted of joyriding not vehicle theft. the trial court made no finding as to the value of the vehicle. iii. discussion that his conviction under vehicle code section 10851 (section 10851) was for joyriding, not vehicle theft. instead he argues for the first time on appeal3 that excluding posttheft driving and joyriding convictions under section 10851 from proposition 47 relief would lead to an absurd result and an equal protection violation because a person convicted of vehicle theft (a more serious crime) is guilty of a misdemeanor while a person guilty of unlawful driving (a less serious crime) can receive a felony exceed $950. [penal code section] 490.2 states: notwithstanding [s]ection 487 or any other provision of law defining grand theft, obtaining any property by theft where the value of the money, labor, real or personal property taken does not exceed nine hundred fifty dollars ($950) shall be considered petty theft and shall be punished as a misdemeanor, except that such person may instead be punished pursuant to subdivision (h) of [s]ection 1170 if that person has one or more prior convictions for an offense specified in clause (iv) of subparagraph (c) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (e) of [s]ection 667 or for an offense requiring registration pursuant to subdivision (c) of [s]ection 3 the attorney general does not assert forfeiture. 4 sentence. this is a question of law subject to our independent review. (people v. wolfe (2018) 20 cal.app.5th 673, 687; people v. castel (2017) 12 cal.app.5th 1321, 1325.) we disagree with s. a. the absurd consequences doctrine people v. rizo (2000) 22 cal.4th 681, 685.) those principles require giving the their ordinary meaningibid.) an exception to these basic principles may arise if following thefundamental principle of statutory construction is that the language of a statute should not be given a literal meaning if doing so would result in absurd consequences which the legislature [or the electorate] dipeople v. cook (2015) 60 cal.4th 922, 927.) meaning of the words may be disregarded to avoid absurd miklosy v. regents of university of california (2008) 44 cal.4th 876, 897-898 (miklosy) [quoting california school employees assn. v. governing bd. of south orange county community college dist. (2004) 124 cal.app.4th f different categories of individuals may be found, the absurd consequences doctrine does not apply. (miklosy, supra, 44 cal.4th at p. 898.) 5 defendant contends that in light of page, proposition 47 must be construed to apply to all violations of section 10851, subdivision (a), and that treating the driving of a vehicle without than the taking of a vehicle according than theft and should not be punished more harshly, and in passing proposition 47, the voters intended offenders convicted of unlawful driving under section 10851 be treated similarly to offenders convicted of theft under that statute. in page, our supreme court explained that section 10851 prohibitions page, supra, 3 cal.5th at p. 1182.) that is, the intent to per(ibid.) section 10851 also either to permanently or temporarily deprive the owner thereof of his or her title to or possession of the vehicle, whether with or without intent to steal the vehicle (ibid., original italics.) driving a vehicle without without an intent to steal the vehicle is not theft. an example of this is joyridingdriving a vehicle with the intent only to temporarily deprive its owner of possession.people v. garza (2005) 35 cal.4th 866, 876 (garza).) people v. van orden (2017) 9 cal.app.5th 1277, 1286.) the page court referred extensively to garza. in garza, the supreme court held that taking a vehicle with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of possession is a form of theft . . . .garza, supra, 35 cal.4th at p. 871.) but, 6 driving of a vehicle is not a form of theft when the driving occurs or continues after the theft is complete . . . . therefore, a conviction under section 10851(a) for (ibid.) relying on garza, the page court held that a conviction for taking a vehicle worth $950 or less is a form of theft that falls within penal code section 490.2 and is eligible for resentencing under proposition 47. (page, supra, 3 cal.5th at p. 1180.) on the other hand, a conviction under section 10851 for unlawful driving may be id. at p. 1188.) the page court explained that to be eligible for proposition 47 resentencing, the defendant must show that the conviction was based on theft rather than on posttheft driving . . . .id. at p. 1189.) the page court therefore modified the judgment to allow the defendant to show he was convicted of was $950 or less. (ibid.) nothing in page requires the conclusion that a defendant convicted of unlawful driving under section 10851whether joyriding or posttheft drivingis entitled to proposition 47 resentencing. to the contrary, page specifically distinguished between taking a vehicle, which may be a theft, and driving, which may not. if all section 10851 violations fell under proposition 47, the supreme court would not have modified the judgment to allow the defendant to show that his section 10851 conviction was based on theft and not driving.4 4 defendant asserts that page left open the question whether unlawful driving under section 10851 is subject to proposition 47 resentencing. the question page left open is slightly different7 further, the page decision details how the statutory property by theft falls within proposition 47 (page, supra, 3 cal.5th at p. 1186), and explains how this interpretation of the statute is consistent with the id. at p. 1187.) in contrast, defendant here points to no language in the statute, no intent, and no legislative history suggesting that proposition 47 covers unlawful driving. nor does defendant persuasively explain why having different punishments for different offensestheft of a vehicle and non-theft driving of a vehicleis absurd. the force of his argument is that, in his personal estimation, unlawful driving under section 10851 is an theft of a vehicle. but it is not for this court to rank levels of culpability. define degrees of culpability and punishment, and to distinguish between crimes in this regard. [citation.] courts routinely people v. turnage (2012) 55 cal.4th 62, 74.) we decline to intrude upon the prerogative of the voters who decided that theft of a vehicle worth $950 or less should be whether equal protection or the avoidance of absurd convicted for taking a vehicle without the intent to permanently deprive the owpage, supra, 3 cal.5th at p. 1188, fn. 5.) this question may be addressed by the supreme court in people v bullard, review granted february 22, 2017, s239488. that case may also give the supreme court another opportunity to revisit proposition 47 resentencing for driving violations under section 10851. 8 punished as a misdemeanor and that unlawful driving would remain punishable as a felony. b. equal protection defendant argues that the equal protection clauses of the united states and california constitutions mandate that all convictions under section 10851, whether for vehicle theft or unlawful driving, be punishable as misdemeanors under proposition 47. we do not agree. persons similarly situated regarding the legitimate purpose of the law should receipeople v. morales (2016) 63 cal.4th 399, 408.) the state has adopted a classification that affects two or more similarly situated groups in an unequal manner [citations.] (ibid.) because a defendant . . . in a specific term of imprisonment or in the designation a particular crime receives[,] the rational basis test applies. (people v. wilkinson (2004) 33 cal.4th 821, 838 (wilkinson).) a statutory classification must be rationally related to a legitimate governmental purpose.id. at p. 836.) those convicted of unlawful driving are not similarly situated to those convicted of unlawfully taking a vehicle under section 10851, but even if they were, defendant cannot show that the different sentencing scheme is not rationally related to a legitimate governmental purpose. the electorate can rationally extend misdemeanor punishment to some offenses but not others, people v. acosta 9 (2015) 242 cal.app.4th 521, 527-528 [rejecting equal protection claim of no rational basis for treating attempted car burglary (a felony) differently than thefts entitled to misdemeanor resentencing under proposition 47].) here, the voters could rationally decide that unlawfully driving a car may be more dangerous to the public than theft of a car valued at $950 or less. (see, e.g., wilkinson, supra, 33 cal.4th at p. 839 [statutory scheme punishing battery on a custodial officer without injury more severely than battery on a custodial officer with injury was not irrational]; people v. romo (1975) 14 cal.3d 189, 196-197 [statute permitting a harsher sentence for assault with a deadly weapon than for assault with intent to commit murder did not violate the equal protection clause].) 10 iv. disposition the order is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports seigle, j. we concur: baker, acting p.j. moor, j. judge of the los angeles superior court, assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi, section 6 of the california constitution.
