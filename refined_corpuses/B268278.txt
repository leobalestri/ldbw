(pen. code,  1170.18.)1 his appointed counsel filed a no-issue brief under people v. wende (1979) 25 cal.3d 436. we notified defendant of his right to respond, but received no response. in march 2015, appellant was charged with first-degree burglary, person present, based on his entry into an apartment on january 28, 2015. in july 2015, the information was amended to add a second-degree burglary count based on the same underlying facts. appellant pled no contest to second-degree burglary ( 459, 460), and was sentenced to three years in prison. in october 2015, he requested a reduction of his felony conviction to a misdemeanor. he was found ineligible and his request was denied. section 459 defines burglary generally, whereas section 460 specifies that residential burglary is of the first degree, and all other burglaries are of the second. ( . . . or the inhabited portion of any other building, is burglary of the first degreepeople v. deay (1987) 194 neither section 459, not section 460 is listed in section 1170.18, subdivision (a), which makes misdemeanor resentencing available to or 11377 of the health and safety code, or section 459.5, 473, 476a, 490.2, 496, or 666 of the penal code . . . newly added section 459.5 creates an exception to section 459 only for misdemeanor shoplifting(459.5, subd.
