(people v. guiffre (2008) 167 cal.app.4th 430, 434.) following the revocation of probation, a trial court may not impose new restitution fines for the same conviction. (people v. cropsey (2010) 184 cal.app.4th 961, 966 (cropsey).) however, where a probation revocation restitution fine has been previously imposed, it survive[s] the revocation of probation. (id. at p. 965, quoting people v. chambers (1998) 65 cal.app.4th 819, 822.) accordingly, there is no need to reimpose an extant restitution fine. (cropsey, supra, at p. 966.) rather, the court should lift the stay on the section 1202.44 fine. (people v. guiffre, supra, 167 cal.app.4th at p. 435.) 4 section 1202.44 provides that the probation revocation fine shall not be waived or reduced by the court, absent compelling and extraordinary reasons stated on record. relying on people v. tillman (2000) 22 cal.4th 300 (tillman), appellant argues the failure of the court to orally reimpose the probation revocation fine renders the subsequent imposition of the fine in the minute order and abstract of judgment unauthorized. we disagree. tillman is distinguishable, as there, the trial court did not impose a restitution fine or parole revocation fine at the defendants initial sentencing. our supreme court held that those restitution fines could not be imposed subsequently. (id. at p. 302.) in contrast, here, the $280 probation revocation restitution fine was imposed at appellants sentencing following his plea, and he was advised that he would have to pay it if he violated probation. the fine became effective immediately upon the revocation of appellants probation, without any further action required by the trial court. ( 1202.44; cropsey, supra, 184 cal.app.4th at pp. 965-966.) absent a judicial finding of compelling and extraordinary reasons, stated on the record, the probation revocation fine could not be waived or reduced. ( 1202.44.) as the trial court made no such finding of compelling and extraordinary reasons to waive or reduce the probation revocation fine, the minute order and abstract of judgment correctly reflected that appellant was required to pay the extant probation revocation fine. 5 disposition the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. manella, j. we concur: epstein, p. j. collins, j.
