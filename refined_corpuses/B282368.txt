(a); count one), and one count of carrying a concealed firearm in a vehicle, a misdemeanor ( 25400, subd. (a)(1); count two). as to 1 unless otherwise indicated, all further statutory references are to the penal code. 3 count one, the information also alleged that defendant personally used a firearm ( 1203.06, subd. (a)(1), 12022.5, subd. (a)). defendant pled not guilty and denied the special allegation. at the conclusion of trial, the jury found defendant guilty on both counts and found true the firearm allegation. the court sentenced defendant to a total term of six years in state prison. placed him on formal probation for five years pursuant to specified terms and conditions. defendant timely appealed. ii. evidence at trial the prosecution presented evidence that on october 6, 2016 around 9:00 p.m., marvin2 was stopped at a red light at an intersection. he was driving his dodge durango; his seven-year-old son was sitting in the back seat and his mother-in-law was in the passenger seat. while they were waiting at the light, he felt was concerned about his directly behind his car. marvin glanced at the rear of his car, but could not tell whether there was any damage because it was dark. marvin testified t3 defendant was seated in the 2 pursuant to california rules of court, rule 8.90 (b)(4), we refer to the victim in this case by his first name to protect his personal privacy interests. no disrespect is intended. 3during cross-examination, marvin admitted that he was angry when he got out of his car, and that he might have said 4 forward and lean back; he then saw defendant was holding a gun. marvin heard defendant make a racking sound with the gun; reatening manner threatening walked back toward his car. at the time, he was thinking defendant could have killed him, and he was worried that his son have been after marvin got back into his car, the traffic light turned green and he drove through the intersection. prior to the incident, he had seen a police car a short distance in front of him, so he sped up and honked at the officers. when one of the officers the two police detectives turned on their lights and siren and initiated a traffic stop of defendimmediately pulled over and complied with their instructions. defendant was the only person in the car. police officers recovered several hollow-point bullets from from under the front passenger seat. the gun was not loaded. the gun had been legally purchased by and was registered to defendant. 5 defendant did not testify or present other evidence at trial. discussion i. criminal threats defendant contends there is insufficient evidence that he threats. we disagree. in reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence, we determine to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the (people v. holt (1997) 15 cal.4th 619, 667.) we do not weigh the evidence or decide the credibility of the witnesses. we draw all reasonahypothesis whatever is there sufficient substantial evidence to people v. bolin (1998) 18 cal.4th 297, 331.) undperson, with the specific intent that the statement, made verbally, in writing, or by means of an electronic communication device, is to be taken as a threat, . . . which, on its face and under the circumstances in which it is made, is so unequivocal, unconditional, immediate, and specific as to convey to the person threatened, a gravity of purpose and an immediate prospect of execution of the threat, and thereby causes that person reasonably to be in sustained fear for his or her own safety or for based on this statutory language, courts have required a threat charged under section 422 to include some words or sound 6 gonzalez, supra, 2 cal.5th 1138, the supreme court reversed a threat conviction where the defendant communicated the threat simulated a pistol id. at p. 1140.) to determine whether nonverbal conduct fell within the scope of section 422, the gonzalez court first reviewed the legislative history of the statute. (gonzalez, supra, 2 cal.5th at pp. 1142-1146.) the prior version of section 422 applied to a -4185.) court in gonzalez noted that evidence code section 225 defines 4 (gonzalez, supra, 2 cal.5th at p. 1143.) the current language of section 422, requiring a writing, or by (gonzalez, supra, 2 cal.5th at p. 1143.) as such, the court primarily focused on expanding the reach of [ ] section 422 to id. at p. 1144.) indeed, in 2002, four years after amending section 422, the legislature amended another criminal 4 specifically, evidence code section 225 defines nonverbal conduct of a person intended by him as a substitute for oral or written verbal expression. 7 threat statute to expressly include a reference to evidence code section 225. (see id. at pp. 1144-1145, citing section 11418.5.)5 conversely, the court also noted that in 2000, the legislature had considered but failed to pass an amendment of section 422 to add a reference to evidence code section 225. (id. at p. 1145.) in light of this legislative history, the gonzalez court vthat nonverbal conduct may qualify as a statement under section gonzalez, supra, 2 cal.5th at pp. 1145-1146.) condid. at p. 1147.)6 here, defendant contends that the evidence at trial established only that he made a threat through nonverbal conductdisplaying and manipulating his gun. this conduct communicated to the victim that he might be harmed if he did defendant argues that without did not convey a threat. 5 section 11418.5, subdivision (a) previously contained that the statement, made verbally, in writing, or by means of an electronic communication device, is to be taken as a threat. . . . (stats. 1999, ch. 563,  1, pp. 3938-3939.) as amended, section any person who knowingly threatens to use a weapon of mass destruction, with the specific intent that the statement as defined in section 225 of the evidence code or a statement made by means of an electronic communication device, is to be taken as a threat. . . . 6 we note that the trial court here did not have the benefit of gonzalez, supra, 2 cal.5th 1138, as it was decided after the proceedings in this case. 8 conduct the nature of the threat. this approach is not supported by gonzalez, supra, 2 cal.5th at p. 1147, which did not involve any verbal conduct. nor is it consistent with the numerous cases holding t(people v. mendoza, supra, 59 cal.app.4th at p. 1340; see also franz, supra, 88 cal.app.4th at p. 1446; people v. butler (2000) 85 cal.app.4th 745, 753 (butler).) indeed, courts have repeatedly upheld convictions for nonverbal conduct taken together. (see, e.g., people v. wilson (2010) 186 cal.app.4th 789, 814 [finding a threat where defendant said he had killed officers in the past, said he would fingers]; people v. martinez (1997) 53 cal.app.4th 1212, 1218, m going to and cursed at him, he got within very close proximity to his face, people v. franz (2001) 88 cal.app.4th 1426, 1436 (franz), cited by the attorney general, franz stood behind a police officer as the officer interviewed an eyewitness. franz looked at the witness, held an index finger in front of his lips with a shushing noise, then ran his thumb across his throat. (ibid.) the court agreed with franz made some noise or sound that was capable of conveying 9 id. at p. 1442.) the court affirmed the conviction, amplified by the throat-slashing gesture to constitute a threat to id. at p. 1446.)7 gleaned from the words and all of the surrounding circumstances. . . . thus, it is the circumstances under which the threat is made butler, supra, 85 statement to the victim that she needed to mind her own business or see also, e.g., franz, supra, 88 cal.app.4th at p. 1446; people v. martinez, supra, 53 cal.app.4th at pp. 1218, 1220.) accordingly, -d- together with his nearly-simultaneous nonverbal conduct with the gun. together, those actions communicated to marvin that if he did not stop asking about his car and withdraw, defendant would shoot him. as such, there was sufficient evidence to allow the jury to find a threat under section 422 nonverbal. 7 we note that the court in gonzalez, discussing the holding in franzgonzalez involved neither. (gonzalez, supra, 2 cal.5th at p. 1147, fn. 8.) 10 ii. self-defense instruction defendant contends his criminal threats conviction also ailure to instruct the jury on self-defense. we find no error. defense if there is substantial evidence to support the defense . people v. saavedra (2007) 156 cal.app.4th 561, 567 (saavedra).) in determining whether there is substantial if believed by the jury, was sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt. . . . (people v. salas (2006) 37 cal.4th 967, 982.) there is no dispute that a self-defense theory was further argues that there was substantial evidence to support the defense. the elements of self-defense, as set forth in calcrim no. 3470, the self-reasonably believed that [he] was in imminent danger of suffering bodily injury; [] 2. the defendant reasonably believed that the immediate use of force was necessary to defend against that danger; [] and [] 3. the defendant used no more force (people v. villanueva (2008) 169 cal.app.4th 41, 4950.) the evidence at trial did not support a self-defense instruction. after a minor collision, marvin exited his vehicle thing to that effect. there is no evidence that marvin was holding a weapon, or anything that could be mistaken for one, or that he made any overt threats or 11 threatening gestures. defendant remained in his car and had pulled out his gun while marvin was still some distance away. after marvin saw the gun, he retreated. under these circumstances, there was no evidence from which a jury could find that defendant reasonably believed he was in imminent danger of bodily injury such that the immediate use of force was necessary to defend himself. tellingly, the cases cited by defendant demonstrate the difference between this case and one in which a self-defense instruction was supported by the evidence. in saavedra, for example, a prison inmate was searched after he had been severely beaten by two other inmates in a fight. authorities found a knife inside his shoe and charged him with possession of a weapon. the defendant testified that he had picked up the weapon from one of his assailants during the fight, intending to use it to defend himself. (saavedra, supra, 156 cal.app.4th at pp. 565-566.) the defendant was therefore entitled to an instruction on self-defense because there was substantial evidence that he ar of immediate (id. at p. 569.) similarly, in people v. lemus (1988) 203 cal.app.3d 470, the defendant testified that while he was in a d body. the victim also threatened to kill the defendant and tried to stab him. the defendant then pulled out his own knife and stabbed the victim. (id. at p. 477.) the trial court refused to give a self-defense instruction based on its determination that the defendant was substantial.(ibid.) an exclusive function of the jury and is not to be usurped by the 12 (ibid.; see also people v. white (1980) 101 cal.app.3d 161, 167-168 [self-defense instruction warranted where defendant causing her to panic and bite the officer when she could not breathe].) here, by contrast, there was no evidence of an actual or imminent physical attack against defendant, nor did the court make any credibility determinations in error. as such, the trial court was not required to instruct on self-defense. iii. possession of concealed handgun defendant also contends that his conviction on count two for possession of a concealed firearm in a vehicle violates the second amendment. we are not persuaded. section 25400(a)(1) makes it a crime for one to carry direction any pistol, revolver, or other firearm capable of being prohibits open carry of firearms outside the home. ( 25850, 26350.) however, there are numerous exceptions to these general prohibitions. for example, the prohibitions of sections does not apply to carrying a gun within a locked container ( 25610), to and from a licensed target range ( 25540), or by an individual engaged in licensed hunting or fishing ( 25640), among other exceptions. (see peruta v. county of san diego (9th cir. 2016) 824 f.3d 919, 925 (peruta) [listing exceptions].) in addition, individuals with a license to carry a concealed firearm are expressly exempt. ( 25655.) the penal code authorizes the county sheriff or chief of a municipal police department to issue a concealed carry license to 13 a person upopursuant to the policy published by the los angeles county ncing evidence of a clear and present danger to life, or of great bodily harm to the applicant, his spouse, or dependent child, which cannot be adequately dealt with by existing law enforcement resources, and which danger cannot be reasonably avoided by alternative measures, and which danger would be department contains a similar requirement. defendant asserts that the exemption under section 25655 law-abiding citizen to obtain a license to carry a concealed s governing concealed carry, asserting that absent these unconstitutional restrictions, he would have been able to lawfully carry his concealed handgun in his vehicle. we review questions of constitutional law de novo. (people v. cromer (2001) 24 cal.4th 889, 893-894.) defendant acknowledges that the ninth circuit considered and rejected the same arguments challenging similar policies in two other california counties in peruta, supra, 824 f.3d 919, 925 (peruta). he notes, however, that the majority opinion in peruta was criticized by the four dissenting judges, as well as by justice thomas in his dissent from the denial of certiorari. (see peruta v. california (2017) 137 s.ct. 1995, 1996 (thomas, j., dissenting from denial of certiorari); peruta, supra, 824 f.3d at p. 954 14 (callahan, j., dissenting).) he concludes that the dissenting in peruta, an en banc panel considered whether the protection of the second amendment extends to carrying (peruta, supra, 824 f.3d at p. 927.) the court declined to reach the plaintiffs concealed carry permits. (ibid.) after an analysis of historical sources and prior case law, the majority of the court concluded not include, in any degree, the right of a member of the general id. at p. 939.) the peruta have upheld the authority of states to prohibit entirely or to limit s(ibid., citing peterson v. martinez (10th cir. 2013) 707 f.3d 1197 [no second amendment right to carry concealed weapons]; woollard v. gallagher (4th cir. 2013) 712 f.3d 865 [maryland requirement that handgun permits be issued only to individuals handgun does not violate second amendment]; drake v. filko (3d cir. 2013) 724 f.3d 426, 429restrictkachalsky v. cty. of westchester (2d cir. 2012) 701 f.3d 81 [new violate second amendment].) 15 we agree with the analysis and conclusions reached by the court in peruta, supra, 824 f.3d at p. 939. here, as in that case, to obtain a license to carry a concealed firearm. busecond amendment does not protect in any degree the right to carry concealed firearms in public, any prohibition or restriction a state may choose to impose on concealed carryincluding a is necessarily ibid.; see also people v. yarbrough (2008) 169 cal.app.4th 303, 313-concealed on the person or in a vehicle . . . is not in the nature of a common use of a gun for lawful purposes which the court declared to be protected by the second amendment in [district of columbia v.] heller to meet intermediate constitutional scrutiny is therefore moot, as he has not esunited states v. chovan (9th cir. 2013) 735 f.3d 1127, 1136.) iv. probation condition nextcondition requiring hiunconstitutionally overbroad, in violation of his rights to travel and to freedom of association. we conclude that defendant has forfeited his constitutional failure to object to probation conditions at the sentencing hearing waives the claim on appeal. (people v. welch (1993) 5 cal.4th 228, 234-dify or 16 delete an allegedly unreasonable condition or to explain why it is necessary in the particular case. the parties must, of course, be given a reasonable opportunity to present any relevant argument and evidence. a rule foreclosing appellate review of claims not timely raised in this manner helps discourage the imposition of invalid probation conditions and reduce the number of costly ibid.) however, there is an exception to this forfeiture rule where a defendant raises a facial constitutional challenge to a probation resolved without reference to the particular sentencing record in re sheena k. (2007) 40 cal.4th 875, 890 (sheena k.); see also people v. stapleton (2017) 9 cal.app.5th 989, 994 (stapletona probation condition is facially overbroad and violates fundamental constitutional rights is based on undisputed facts, it may be treated as a pure question of law, which is not forfeited by sheena k., supra, 40 cal.4th at p. 878, the supreme court applied this iate with element, and without reference to the underlying record. (id. at p. 888.) the court cautioned, however, that this exception would id. at p. 889.) we find the forfeiture exception inapplicable here. to determine whether an otherwise valid condition is 17 carefully and reasonably related to the compelling state interest question in an overbreadth challenge is the closeness of the fit between the legitimate purpose of the restriction and the burden it imposes on the defendant's constitutional rightsbearing in mind, of course, that perfection in such matters is impossible, and in re e.o. (2010) 188 cal.app.4th 1149, 1153; see also stapleton, supra, 9 cal.app.5th at p. 993.) unlike in sheena k., the error defendant asserts here is not capable of correction without reference to the underlying sentencing record. (sheena k., supra, 40 cal.4th at p. 887.) whether this particular case warranted a need for broad restrictionwithout reference to the facts. (see, e.g., people v. arevalo (cal. ct. app., jan. 17, 2018, g054483) ___ cal.rptr.3d___ [2018 wl 456917, at *3] of hpeople v. bauer (1989) 211 cal.app.3d 937, 944 [striking residence approval history].) as such, by failing to object to this condition in the trial court, defendant has forfeited his right to raise it on appeal. v. recent amendment to section 12022.5 two years on the criminal threat count, plus the midterm of four years for the personal use of a firearm enhancement under section 12022.5, subdivision (a). at the time of sentencing, that section provided no discretion to the trial court to strike a firearm 18 use enhancement. effective january 1, 2018, section 12022.5 was amended by the passage of senate bill no. 620; the statute now allows the trial court, in its discretion, to strike a firearm use enhancement. ( 12022.5, subd. (c).) defendant requests remand so that the trial court may consider whether to strike the firearm enhancement under the amended section 12022.5. the attorney general concedes that the amendment applies retroactively to defendant, as the judgment in this case was not final as of january 1, 2018. (see people v. brown (2012) 54 cal.4th 314, 323-324.) however, the attorney general suggests that remand is unwarranted, because would not have exercised its discretion to strike the enhancement (see, e.g., people v. gamble ([i]f the record shows that the trial court would not have exercised its discretion even if it believed it could do so, then remand would be an idle act and is not requiredpeople v. gutierrez (1996) 48 cal.app.4th 1894, sentencing court clearly indicated that it would not, in any event, made in the exercise of (people v. brown (2007) 147 cal.app.4th 1213, 1228.) here, remand is necessary to allow the court to exercise its discretion under the amended version of the statute. moreover, it is not for this court to speculate how the trial court would exercise its discretion following the opportunity to hear enhancement. it is more prudent to remand unless no reasonable 19 court could exercise discretion in the dcannot say that remand would be futile in this case. disposition the case is remanded for the trial court to exercise its discretion under section 12022.5. the judgment is affirmed in all other respects. not to be published in the official reports collins, j. we concur: willhite, acting p. j. manella, j.
