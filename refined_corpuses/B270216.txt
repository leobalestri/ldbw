1 filed 10/31/16 p. v. sheppard ca2/2 not to be published in the official reports california rules of court, rule 8.1115(a), prohibits courts and parties from citing or relying on opinions not certified for publication or ordered published, except as specified by rule 8.1115(b). this opinion has not been certified for publication or ordered published for purposes of rule 8.1115. in the court of appeal of the state of california second appellate district division two the people, plaintiff and respondent, v. lamont sheppard, defendant and appellant. b270216 (los angeles county super. ct. no. ta034259) the court:* lamont sheppard appeals from the denial of his request for resentencing pursuant to proposition 47 (pen. code,  1170.18).1 we appointed counsel to represent him on this appeal. counsel filed an opening brief pursuant to people v. wende (1979) 25 cal.3d 436 (wende), and requested this court to independently review the record on appeal to determine whether any arguable issues exist. * boren, p.j., chavez, j., hoffstadt, j. 1 all further statutory references are to the penal code. 2 we sent a notice to defendant, advising him he had 30 days in which to personally submit any contentions or issues which he wished us to consider. he has submitted a supplemental brief containing three such contentions. defendant contends his appellate counsel is constitutionally ineffective, his sentence constitutes double punishment and his convictions are void. filing a wende brief does not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel. defendant was not convicted of any offense specified in proposition 47 and so has not shown error in the denial of his motion for resentencing. his claims of void convictions and double punishment are not related to his proposition 47 resentencing request and are not cognizable on this appeal. background in 1996, defendant was convicted by a jury of two counts of willful, deliberate and premeditated attempted murder ( 187, 664), one count of assault with a firearm ( 245, subd. (a)(2)), and one count of negligent discharge of a firearm ( 246.3). the jury found true the allegations that a principal was armed with a firearm in the commission of the attempted murders and the assault. the jury found not true allegations that defendant personally used a firearm, personally discharged a firearm and personally inflicted great bodily injury. the trial court sentenced defendant to life with the possibility of parole plus a one-year enhancement term for the armed principal enhancement for each attempted murder conviction and to 16 months for the assault conviction and accompanying firearm enhancement, all to run consecutively. in 2015, defendant filed his request for resentencing pursuant to proposition 47. he contended that he was entitled to resentencing because the jury found not true the sentencing allegations that he inflicted great 3 bodily injury on the victims and personally used and discharged a firearm. he further contended that his resulting sentence was clearly erroneous. set forth good cau discussion 1. ineffective assistance of counsel wende brief is relieve counsel and appoint new substitute counsel. [t]he constitutional right to assistance of counsel entitles an indigent defendant to independent review by the court of appeal when counsel is unable to identify any arguable issue on appeal. wende] procedure for securing this right requires counsel to file a brief summarizing the proceedings and the facts with citations to the record, and requires the appellate court to review the entire record to determine whether there is any people v. kelly (2006) 40 cal.4th 106, 119.) the united states supreme court has approved the wende procedure in smith v. robbins (2000) 528 u.s. 259. (people v. kelly, supra, 40 cal.4th at p. 118.) assistance simply by filing a wende brief. an appellate counsel who files a wende the case so long as he has not described the appeal as frivolous and has informed the defendant that he may request the court to have counsel relieved if he speople v. wende, supra, 25 cal.3d at p. 442.) here, has informed defendant that he may ask this court to relieve counsel. thus, we have no basis to remove counsel on our own motion. even if we construed 4 counsel be relieved, defendant has not identified a basis for such relief. 2. sentencing claims on appeal, defendant expands the contention he made in the trial court to resentencing. he now contends these findings amounted to an implicit acquittal of the attempted murder and assault charges, rendering the attempted murder and assault convictions void. defendant also adds a second contention, contending he was improperly given two strikes for one act. neither claim provides a basis for relief under proposition 47. proposition 47 establishes resentencing for persons convicted of sections 11350, 11357, or 11377 of the health and safety code, or section 459.5, 473, 476a, 490.2, 496, or 666 of the penal code, as those  1170.18, subd. (a).) deffirearm ( 245) and negligent discharge of a firearm ( 246.3) do not qualify for resentencing under proposition 47. defendant asserts that his contentions are fundamentally claims the trial court acted in excess of its jurisdiction in sentencing him to life in prison and so his sentence may be corrected at any contention is simply a claim that the verdicts and the findings on the sentencing allegations are inconsistent. such inconsistency does not render his convictions void. (see people v. lewis (2001) 25 cal.4th 610, 656 [inherently inconsistent verdicts or sentencing allegations are allowed to e three strikes law, but defendant was not sentenced under that law. 5 3. independent review of the record appeal has complied with the responsibilities of counsel and no arguable issue exists.
