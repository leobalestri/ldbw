(a)); a 16-month term on count 2, plus three years, four months on the firearm enhancement ( 12022.53, subd. (b)); a 16-month term on count 3, plus three years, four months on the firearm enhancement ( 12022.53, subd.

(b)), a $200 parole revocation fine ( 1202.45), which was stayed, a $40 court security fee ( 1465.8), and a $30 court assessment fee (gov. code,  70373). the trial court awarded defendant 959 days of custody credit consisting of 834 days of actual custody credit and 125 days of conduct credit. defendant filed a timely notice of appeal. 4 discussion a. abstract of judgmentnumber of prior prison term enhancements defendant contends, and the attorney general agrees, that the abstract of judgment must be amended to reflect seven prior prison term enhancements rather than eight as reflected in the abstract of judgment. we agree. prior to the sentencing hearing, defendant admitted to having suffered seven prior prison term convictions. at the sentencing hearing, the trial judge noted there were seven admitted prior prison term convictions, imposed sentence on them, and as discussed below, stayed imposition of sentence on five of them. the abstract of judgment however reflects that there were eight prior prison term convictions. s oral sentence governs if it is different from what appears in a minute order or an abstract of judgment [citations] . . . . (people v. wynn (2010) 184 cal.app.4th 1210, 1221; people v. mitchell (2001) 26 cal.4th 181, 185; people v. walz (2008) 160 cal.app.4th 1364, 1367, fn. 3.) accordingly, the abstract of judgment should be amended to reflect the trial court imposed seven rather than eight prior prison term enhancements. b. stay imposition of sentence on prior prison term enhancements defendant contends that the trial court erred in staying imposition of sentence on five prior prison term one-year enhancements, rather than striking the imposition of sentence on the enhancements. the attorney general agrees that the trial court erred in staying imposition of sentence on the five prior prison term enhancements, but argues that the matter should be remanded to the trial court for it to exercise its discretion under 5 section 667.5, subdivision (b) to either impose the enhancements or strike imposition of sentence on them.4 we agree with the attorney general. in sentencing defendant, the trial judge imposed a sentence of two years on the two most recent prior prison term enhancements, and stayed imposition of sentence on the five remaining prior prison term enhancements. the trial court erred in staying imposition of sentence on the prior prison term enhancements. section 667.5, subdivision (b) provides for a one year enhancement of the prison term for a new offense or each prior separate prison term served for certain felonies. section 1170.1, subdivision (d) provides: a felony . . . the court shall also impose . . . the additional terms provided for any applicable enhancements once a prior prison term is found true within the meaning of section 667.5, subdivision (b), the trial court may strike the imposition of the enhancement, but may not stay imposition of sentence on it. (people v. langston (2004) 33 cal.4th 1237, 1241; people v. haykel (2002) 96 cal.app.4th 146, 151; people v. jones (1992) 8 cal.app.4th 756, 758.) tther to strike imposition of sentence on the five prior prison term enhancements, or impose sentence on them. the matter is remanded for the trial court to exercise its discretion under section 667.5, subdivision (b) to either impose sentence on the enhancements or strike them. c. abstract of judgmentrestitution and parole revocation fines defendant contends that the abstract of judgment must be amended to reflect a reduced amount for the restitution and parole revocation fines, or the matter should be remanded to the trial court for resentencing. the attorney general agrees that the abstract of judgment must be amended to reflect a reduced amount for the restitution and parole revocation fines. we agree that the abstract of judgment must be amended. 4 6 at sentencing, the trial court orally ordered defendant to pay a $200 restitution fine under section 1202.4 and a $200 parole revocation fine under section 1202.45. as discussed below, this was an unauthorized sentence. in addition, because the abstract of judgment reflects a $300 restitution fine under section 1202.4 and a $300 parole revocation fine under section 1202.45, it does not reflect the trial courtpronouncement. the minimum parole revocation fine under section 1202.45, subdivision (a), is set section 1202.4, subdivision (b)(1) provides that from january 1, 2012, through january 1, 2013, the minimum restitution fine is $240. the restitution and parole revocation fines each in the amount of $240 apply to defendant because he committed his offenses in 2012. (people v. souza (2012) 54 cal.4th 90, 143 [controlling date for determining the amount of a sentencing fine is the date defendant committed the offenses].) the abstract of judgment should be amended to reflect that restitution and parole revocation fines are each $240. 7 disposition the matter is remanded for the trial court to amend the abstract of judgment to reflect the trial courts oral pronouncement that it imposed seven prior prison term enhancements, and that restitution and parole revocation fines are each $240; and to exercise its discretion under section 667.5, subdivision (b) to either impose sentence on the five prior prison term enhancements, or strike imposition of sentence on the enhancements. in all other respects, the judgment is affirmed. not to be published in the official reports. mosk, j. we concur: turner, p. j. kriegler, j.
