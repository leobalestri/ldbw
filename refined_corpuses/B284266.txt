violation of health and safety code section 11352. in 2016 she filed a motion to vacate her no contest plea, arguing that, when accepting her plea in 1989, the court failed to advise her of the immigration consequences of her plea. the trial court denied that motion, and we affirm. factual and procedural history a. zagastume pleads no contest the people filed an information in 1989 charging zagastume with selling or transporting cocaine. the information indicated the maximum term of imprisonment was five years. zagastume pleaded no contest, and the trial court placed her on probation for three years on condition she serve 90 days in jail, with credit for time served. the plea form contained the sentence statingon any alien/citizenship/probation/parole handwritten across a small box appeared next to this sentence. the record contains no other court records documenting the plea proceedings. b. the o vacate her plea zagastume filed a motion in 2016 under penal code section 1016.5 to vacate her 1989 plea on the ground the court had failed to advise her of the immigration consequences of her plea.1 after 1 undesignated statutory references are to the penal code. 3 an informal conference, the trial court asked counsel for zagastume: law effective january 1st, 2017, . . . this is a motion to vacate [a] conviction or sentence by a person no longer in prison or restrained, pursuant to penal code section 1473.7, cstatedin light of that, i think you have indicated that you would like to re-file the motion . . . . is responded approximately one month later, zagastume filed a motion under section 1473.7 to vacate her plea. although zagastume ursuant to penal code  1016.5he notice of motion stated: being made pursuant to california penal code  1473.7 based on prejudicial error causing [zagastume] not to knowingly and intelligently waive the immigration consequences to her guilty plea since the court failed to advise [her] of the immigration consequences during the change of plea to guilty demonstrated by guidance utilizing cal. statutory intent of fairness by providing notice to the defendant of the immigration consequences that result from entering a zagastume stated in her supporting declaration: known that pleading guilty to a violation of health and safety code  11352 would lead to a denial of residency through a united states citizen spouse many years after my conviction or of my possible deportation, i would not have pled guilty to that state in her declaration the trial court failed to advise her in 1989 of the immigration consequences of her plea. 4 at the hearing on the motion, the trial court confirmed with the trial court denied the motion, stating: he court finds that [zagastume] has not proved by a preher entitlement to the court added: in s no transcript of the records indicating that she was not advised of the . . . consequences of her plea. therefore, the motion is zagastume timely appealed. discussion zagastume argues that the trial court erred by deciding the motion under section 1473.7, rather than section 1016.5, and that the people argue that zagastume filed her motion to vacate under section 1473.7 and that, even under section 1016.5, the record shows the trial court gave the advisement and zagastume cannot establish prejudice. because zagastume cannot establish prejudice under either statute, we affirm the trial courtorder denying her motion to vacate. a. applicable law and standard of review section 1016.5, subdivision (a), acceptance of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere to any offense punishable as a crime under state law, . . . the court shall administer the following advisement on the record to the defendant: [] if you are not a citizen, you are hereby advised that conviction of the offense for which you have been charged may have the consequences of deportation, exclusion from 5 admission to the united states, or denial of naturalization section 1016.5, subdivision (b), provides, in pertinent part: section and the defendant shows that the conviction of the offense to which defendant pleaded guilty or nolo contendere may have the consequences for the defendant of deportation, exclusion from admission to the united states, or denial of naturalization . . . the permit the defendant to withdraw the plea of guilty or nolo contendere, and enter a plea of not guilty. motion to vacate under section 1016.5, a defendant must establish that (1) he or she was not properly advised . . . ; (2) there exists, at the time of the motion, more than a remote possibility that the conviction will have . . . the specified adverse immigration consequences; and (3) he or she was prejudiced by (people v. totari (2002) 28 cal.4th 876, 884; accord, people v. arendtsz (2016) 247 cal.app.4th 613, 617.) section 1473.7, subdivision (a), which became effective january 1, 2017, provides, in pertinent part: imprisoned or restrained may prosecute a motion to vacate a conviction or sentence for either of the following reasons: [] (1) the conviction or sentence is legally invalid due to a meaningfully understand, defend against, or knowingly accept the actual or potential adverse immigration consequences of a under section 1473.7, the . (people v. olvera (2018) 24 cal.app.5th 1112, 1116; see people v. perez (2018) 19 cal.app.5th 818, 828-82whether a moving party satisfies the required elements to bring a 6 ].) section 1473.7, subdivision conviction or sentence if the moving party establishes, by a preponderance of the evidence, the existence of any of the grounds for relief 2 we 1016.5 or section 1473.7 for abuse of discretion. (see people v. gonzalez (2018) 27 cal.app.5th 738, ___, 238 cal.rptr.3d 443, 450 [under section 1473.7, [a] decision to deny a motion to withdraw a guilty plea rests in the s]; people v. arendtsz, supra, 247 cal.app.4th at p. 617 [under ].) 2 . . . section people v. cruz-lopez (2018) 27 cal.app.5th 212, 221.) for example, on to address a claim that a defendant was deprived of the effective people v. aguilar (2014) 227 cal.app.4th 60, 71.) therefore, [i]neffective meaningfully understand, defend against, or knowingly accept the actual or potential adverse immigration consequences of a guilty plea . . . is the type of error that entitles the defendant to people v. ogunmowo (2018) 23 cal.app.5th 67, 75.) virtually all of the published cases on section 1473.7 involve assertions that trial counsel failed to properly advise a defendant of the immigration consequences of his or her plea. 7 b. the trial court properly denied motion to vacate under either section 1473.7 or section 1016.5, any error in the 1989 advisement was harmless because zagastume cannot show a reasonable probability that, had the trial court properly advised her (assuming it failed to do so), she would not have pleaded no contest to selling and transporting a controlled substance and, instead, proceeded to trial. (see people v. martinez (201[under section 1016.5]. . . only if the defendant establishes people v. olvera, supra, 24 cal.app.5th at p. 1117 [the defendant must show prejudice under section 1473.7]; people v. araujo (2016) 243 cal.app.4th 759, 763 [the defendant must show under section 1016.5 that, but for the failure to advise, [the] defendant would not have entered a guilty plea].) statements by defendants that they would have pleaded differently had they been advised differently require corroboration. post hoc assertions from a defendant about how he would have pleaded. . . . judges should instead look to contemporaneous (people v. ogunmowo (2018) 23 cal.app.5th 67, 78; see people v. martinez, supraassertion that is not supported by an explanation or other .) zagastume asserted in her declaration, 27 years after she pleaded no contest, that, had she known of the immigration consequences of pleading guilty to health and safety code . zagastume, however, did not present any corroborating evidence. absent such evidence, she was not entitled to relief. (see in re resendiz 8 corroborated independeon another ground in padilla v. kentucky (2010) 559 u.s. 356, 370; in re alvernaz ly by people v. arendtsz, supra, 247 cal.app.4th at p. 617 [defendant failed to establish prejudice because the that he would not have pleaded no contest had he been informed of the immigration consequences of his plea]; cf. ogunmowo, supra, 23 cal.app.5th at have rejected the plea deal had his counsel not misadvised him about the immigration consequences of a conviction].) rather than corroborating zagastunot have pleaded no contest had the court advised her of the immigration consequences of her plea, the record undermines it. zagastume argued in her motion to vacate that (in 2016) she had to adjust her immigration status. zagastumemore than two decades before taking any steps to resolve her immigration status suggests that any advisement about the potential immigration consequences would not have outweighed the benefits of her plea, which earned her a probationary sentence with modest jail time on a conviction with a maximum exposure of five years in state prison. zagastume did not present any evidence that the desire to avoid adverse immigration consequences played a central, or any, role in her decision to plead no contest in 1989. (cf. people v. ogunmowo, supra, 23 cal.app.5th at p. 79 [defendant showed that remaining in the united states was important to him because he sought his s advice about the immigration consequences of his plea 9 before pleading guilty].) zagastume did not present evidence showing a reasonable probability she would not have accepted the deal if the court had properly advised her of the immigration consequences of pleading no contest to the charge against her.3 disposition vacate her no contest plea is affirmed. segal, j. we concur: perluss, p. j. feuer, j. 3 although prejudice under section 1016.5 factual question, appropriate for decision by the trial court in the first instance (people v. superior court (zamudio) (2000) 23 cal.4th 183, 210; see people v. araujo (2016) 243 cal.app.4th 759, 763), as discussed, the record here contains no evidence to corroborate assertion of prejudice. in addition, zagastume does not state in her declaration what the court advised or failed to advise her in 1989. thus, even if zagastume could rely on her declaration alone to establish prejudice, she did not show that, but for the failure to advise, would not have people v. araujo, supra, 243 cal.app.4th at p. 763.)
